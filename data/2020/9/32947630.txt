Background:The aim of our study is to analyze viscosity characteristics of focal liver lesions (FLLs) and the diagnostic performance of shear wave dispersion (SWD) in differentiating benign and malignant FLLs.Methods:Between January 2018 and April 2018, 58 consecutive patients (median age 57, age range 21-74 years, 37 males) with 58 FLLs located on the right lobe of liver were prospectively studied. The Aplio i900 series diagnostic ultrasound system (Canon Medical systems) equipped with a curvilinear PV1-475BX transducer (1-8 MHz) was used. SWD slope and viscosity measurements were expressed as mean ± standard deviation for both liver tumors and background liver parenchyma. Histopathological results after surgery were regarded as the gold standard for diagnosis.Results:Final diagnosis included 40 cases of malignant and 18 cases of benign FLLs. The mean viscosity value were 14.78 ± 1.86 m/s/kHz for hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 30), 14.81 ± 2.35 m/s/kHz for liver metastasis lesions (n = 10), 13.23 ± 1.31 m/s/kHz for hemangioma (n = 13), and 13.67 ± 2.72 m/s/kHz for focal nodular hyperplasia (n = 5). Malignant FLLs showed higher mean viscosity values (14.79 ± 3.15 m/s/KHz) than benign FLLs (13.36 ± 2.76 m/s/KHz) (p Conclusions:The analysis of SWD slope and liver viscosity parameters provide additional viscoelastic information about FLLs before operation.
