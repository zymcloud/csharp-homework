Background:Use of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is increasing, but the reported results for interreader agreement seem quite variable.Purpose:To systematically determine the interreader agreement of LI-RADS on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to determine the sources of heterogeneity between the reported results.Study type:Systematic review and meta-analysis.Subjects:Fifteen original articles with 2968 lesions.Field strength:1.5T and 3.0T.Assessment:Two reviewers independently performed the data extraction. The reviewers identified and reviewed the original articles reporting the interreader agreement of LI-RADS using MRI.Statistical tests:The meta-analytic pooled intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for lesion size and kappa value (κ) for major features (arterial-phase hyperenhancement [APHE], nonperipheral washout [WO], enhancing capsule [EC]) and LI-RADS categorization (LR) were calculated using the random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression analysis were performed to explore the cause of study heterogeneity.Results:The meta-analytic pooled ICC of lesion size was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-1.00). Meta-analytic pooled κ of APHE, WO, EC, and LR were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.62-0.82), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.78), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.58-0.74), and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56-0.85), respectively. Substantial study heterogeneity was noted in all five variables (I2 ≥ 89.1%, P < 0.001). Study design, type, and clarity of blinding review were factors that significantly influenced study heterogeneity (P ≤ 0.05).Data conclusion:LI-RADS demonstrated overall substantial interreader agreement for major features and the category on MRI, but showed heterogeneous results between studies.Level of evidence:3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2 J.
