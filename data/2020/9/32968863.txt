Purpose:The LI-RADS Treatment Response (LR-TR) algorithm was introduced in 2017 to assist radiologists in assessing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response following locoregional therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations between pre-treatment LI-RADS diagnostic categories, post-treatment LR-TR categories, and mRECIST response categories with overall survival (OS) of patients with HCC.Methods:This retrospective study included untreated patients with one or two lesions who underwent transarterial embolization with or without concomitant ablation from December 2003 to December 2017. Two radiologists (R1 and R2) reviewed pre- and post-treatment CT imaging. Associations between pre- and post-treatment variables, including post-treatment LR-TR categories (Viable, Equivocal, Nonviable), with OS were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression.Results:Eighty-five patients were included (median age = 71 years, range 50-87; 17 women). The median OS from first embolization was 43.92 months. Pre- and post-treatment tumor size, pre-treatment LR-TIV (compared with LR-5), and post-treatment LR-TR Viable (compared with LR-TR Nonviable) were associated with OS (p Conclusions:LR-TR categories show a strong association with OS in HCC patients treated with transarterial embolization.
