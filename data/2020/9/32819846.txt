Objectives:Reduced pancreatic volume, often referred to as atrophy, is a commonly reported imaging feature of chronic pancreatitis (CP). This study evaluated whether there is an association between pancreatic volume and fibrosis, the criterion standard of CP, in patients undergoing total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) for recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) and CP.Methods:All adult patients who underwent TPIAT between 2010 and 2019 were categorized into 3 groups: RAP, definite CP and indeterminate CP. Pancreatic volume was calculated by summing up the areas from each thin section of the pancreas on 3D CT imaging. Excisional biopsies of the pancreatic head as well as body/tail region were obtained at the time of TPIAT. Two different fibrosis scores were used for histologic assessment.Results:A total of 16, 29 and 15 patients underwent TPIAT for RAP, definite CP and indeterminate CP, respectively. The mean pancreatic volumes for patients with RAP, definite CP and indeterminate CP were 65.7 ± 28.5 cc, 54.9 ± 22.9 cc and 61.8 ± 23.6 cc, respectively (p = 0.3). The mean fibrosis scores were significantly higher in patients with definite CP compared to RAP (p < 0.001) and indeterminate CP (p < 0.001). Pancreatic volume was not associated with either fibrosis score after adjusting for age, gender, duration of disease, BMI and diabetes in the multivariable analysis.Conclusions:While the fibrosis scores were higher in definite CP compared to both RAP and indeterminate CP, there was no correlation between pancreatic volume and fibrosis. This suggests that atrophy alone cannot be used to diagnose CP.
