Expression of the F-box protein FBXO11 has been shown to be down-regulated in various tumors, but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains unclear. Here, we examined the role of FBXO11 in HCC cell stemness. We report that FBXO11 expression is significantly decreased in HCC cells, and overexpression of FBXO11 decreased the expression of HCC stemness markers, ALDH1 activity and sphere-forming ability. In addition, overexpression of FBXO11 reduced the migration ability and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of HCC cells. Mechanistically, overexpression of FBXO11 decreased the protein level, but not mRNA level, of Snail by directly interacting with Snail and promoting Snail degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Overexpression of Snail rescued the inhibitory effect of FBXO11 overexpression on HCC cell stemness. This study reveals the existence of a novel FBXO11/Snail regulatory axis that is necessary for HCC cell stemness.
