Background:Alternative splicing (AS) takes a crucial part in tumor process. We aim to analyze AS in Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or/and hepatitis C virus (HCV) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Cox regression analysis was conducted to screen survival-associated AS events. The receiver operating characteristic curve used to evaluate the predictive accuracy. Splicing network was built to investigate the relationship between splicing factors and AS events.Results:Ninety-six survival-associated AS events were obtained by univariate Cox regression. Final prognostic model could significantly distinguish the prognosis. We identified RBFOX2 as the hub gene in splicing network based on differentially expressed splicing factors, and obtained MAP3K13_AT as the key AS event in survival-related splicing network.Conclusion:Our results highlight the AS signatures in HCC patients with HBV or/and HCV infection. Meanwhile, AS events and splicing factors in different virus-infected HCC subgroups can provide novel perspectives as biomarkers and individualized therapeutic targets.
