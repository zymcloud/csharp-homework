We commend Natarajan et.al. (1) on their work regarding differences in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with or without persistent alanine transferase (ALT) elevations. The study is timely and addresses an important question regarding the prognostication of liver-related outcomes in NAFLD.
