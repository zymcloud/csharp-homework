Context:Owing to the increasing age of the population, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the elderly is increasing annually.Aims:This study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with low-dose apatinib for unresectable HCC treatment in elderly patients (â‰¥65 years).Settings and design:The clinical data from 61 elderly patients with unresectable HCC who were retrospectively analyzed.Subjects and methods:Of these 61 patients, 27 received TACE combined with low-dose (250 mg/qd) apatinib (experimental group), and 34 patients received the standard TACE treatment (control group). The short-term efficacy was evaluated according to the mRECIST1.1 standards, and the mid- and long-term efficacy and safety in the two groups of patients were evaluated.Statistical analysis used:Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (version 20.0; SPSS).Results:Both the objective response rate and disease control rate of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of control group (P Conclusions:TACE combined with low-dose apatinib provides an alternative treatment option for elderly patients with unresectable HCC. Our clinical study has proven its safety and efficacy.
