Background:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) initiation and progression. In this report, we examined the role of lncRNA LINC02476 in HCC.Methods:The expression levels of different lncRNAs in HCC were explored using the TCGA database and lncRNA LINC02476 was selected for further study. The expression of LINC02476 in HCC tissues was determined by real-time PCR. The clinicopathological characteristics of HCC patients were analyzed relative to the expression of LINC02476. The expression of LINC02476 was downregulated in HCC cells using a lentiviral vector and different assays were performed to study cell growth, proliferation, invasion, apoptosis and the cell cycle. MiR-497 was selected as a miRNA that could interact with LINC02476 which was further tested by RNA immunoprecipitation. HMGA2 was selected as a possible target of miR-497, and their interaction was examined by a luciferase reporter assay.Results:LINC02476 expression was elevated in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues. When LINC02476 was downregulated, the growth and the invasion of HCC cells decreased in vitro and in vivo. LINC02476 negatively regulated the expression of miR-497 by acting as a ceRNA. HMGA2 was directly targeted and inhibited by miR-497.Conclusion:The results indicate that LINC02476 functions through the miR-497/HMGA2 axis and that it has a role in the growth and metastasis of HCC cells. Therefore, LINC02476 could be an interesting new molecular target in HCC therapies.
