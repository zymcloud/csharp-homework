Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is globally recognized as one of the most frequently occurring primary malignant liver tumors, making the identification of HCC biomarkers critically important. The protein MITD1 (Microtubule Interacting and Trafficking Domain containing 1) has been shown to interact with ESCRT-III and participates in cytokinesis, the last step in cell division. This is the first investigation into the expression of MITD1 and its prognostic value, potential biological functions and effects on the immune system in HCC patients.Methods:The gene expression and clinicopathology analysis, enrichment analysis and immune infiltration analysis are based on data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), with additional bioinformatics analyses performed. The statistical analysis was conducted in R and immune responses of MITD1 expression in HCC were analyzed using TIMER and CIBERSORT. In addition, GEPIA, K-M survival analysis and data from the HPA were used to validate the outcomes.Results:Our results highlighted that MITD1 plays a key role as an independent prognostic factor in patients with HCC. MITD1 expression was associated with age, grade, stage and tumor status. GSEA revealed that MITD1 is closely correlated with cell cycle control via the NOTCH signaling pathway. CIBERSORT analysis revealed that the amount of NK cells decreased when MITD1 expression was high.Conclusions:The identification of MITD1 as a new biomarker for HCC could help elucidate how changes in cytokinesis and the immune environment promote liver cancer development. With further analysis, MITD1 may be able to serve as a predictor for human HCC prognosis.
