Background/aims:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a major therapeutic modality for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, which needs repeated treatments. Model to Estimate Survival in Ambulatory Hepatocellular carcinoma patients (MESIAH) was recently developed as a model for predicting survival. We aimed to develop a novel index for TACE retreatment using MESIAH scores.Patients and methods:From 2005 to 2008, 783 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone 1 previous TACE procedure were enrolled. We calculated their pre-TACE and post-TACE-MESIAH and calculated the MESIAH ratio by dividing the post-TACE by pre-TACE score. The discriminatory abilities of the MESIAH ratio and post-TACE-MESIAH were compared with ART and ABCR scores.Results:Among 783 patients, 355 (45.3%) received a second TACE (test set), and 195 (24.9%) patients received a third TACE treatment (validation set). In the test set, patients with a MESIAH ratio Conclusions:A MESIAH score â‰¥4.5 after TACE identifies patients with a poor prognosis. Randomized studies are needed to establish whether additional TACE may affect survival.
