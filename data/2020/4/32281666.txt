Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a worldwide etiology of chronic hepatic insult particularly in Egypt. DNA-repair systems are responsible for maintaining genomic integrity by countering threats posed by DNA lesions. Deficiency in the repair capacity due to genetic alterations in DNA-repair genes can lead to genomic instability and increased risk of cancer development. The present work aimed at studying the possible association between XRCC1-G28152A (rs25487), XRCC3-C18067T (rs861539), and XRCC7-G6721T (rs7003908) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Egyptian population. The study was conducted on 100 newly diagnosed HCC patients and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Laboratory workup revealed that all HCC patients have chronic hepatitis C viral infection. Genotyping of the studied SNPs was performed by real-time PCR. The heteromutant genotype of XRCC1 (GA) conferred an almost two-fold increased risk of HCC (OR , 2.35; 95% CI, 1.33-4.04). Regarding XRCC7, the heteromutant (TG) genotype conferred a two-fold increased risk of HCC (OR , 2.17; 95% CI, 1.23-3.82). Coinheritance of the polymorphic genotypes of XRCC1 and 7 was significantly higher in HCC cases than controls and was associated with an 11-fold increased risk of HCC (OR , 11.66; 95% CI, 2.77-49.13). The frequency of XRCC3 polymorphic genotypes in HCC patients was close to that of the controls.
