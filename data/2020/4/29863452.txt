Objectives:We investigated late mortality causes and risk factors in patients who were undergoing deceased-donor liver transplant.Materials and methods:Patients who had deceased-donor liver transplant from February 1997 to June 2014 in the hepatopancreaticobiliary surgery and liver transplant unit at Dokuz Eylul University Hospital were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were patients over 18 years of age and who survived more than 1 year after liver transplant. Causes of mortality and related risk factors after the first year were analyzed.Results:Of the 157 included patients, 102 patients (72%) received transplant procedures for hepatitis B and C secondary to chronic liver disease. Mean follow-up was 89.85 months (range, 14.4-240 months). Of 157 patients, 20 patients (12.7%) died: 12 patients (60%) died during posttransplant years 2-5 and 8 patients (40%) died after 5 years. Causes of death included malignancy in 8 patients (40%), recurrent hepatitis C infection in 3 patients (15%), infection in 3 patients (15%), coronary artery disease in 2 patients (10%), graft rejection in 2 patients (10%), and biliary complications in 2 patients (10%). Univariate analyses showed that long-term survival was significantly lower in patients older than 50 years (P = .001), when there was presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (P = .011), and when donor age was higher than 38 years (P = .045). Multivariate analyses identified recipient age (P = .007) and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.033) as factors that reduced long-term survival.Conclusions:The main causes of late mortality in liver transplant are malignancy, recurrence of hepatitis C, infection, coronary artery disease, graft rejection, and biliary complications. Advanced age and hepatocellular carcinoma are independent risk factors that increase late mortality.
