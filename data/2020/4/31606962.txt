Objective:Liver cancer is the third rank amongst the common malignancies, causing maximum death in the patients diagnosed with cancers. Currently available biomarkers are not enough sensitive for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This makes difficult management of HCC. With the aim of finding new generation of proteomic-based biomarkers, the represented study was designed to characterize the differentially expressed proteins at different stages of HCC initiation and at progression. This could lead to find potential biomarkers for early detection of HCC.Materials and methods:In this experimental study, we report induction of HCC by administrating chemical carcinogens in male Wistar rats. Disease progression was monitored by histological evaluation. Serum proteomic analyses such as 2 dimensional (2D)-electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF-MS/MS and Western blot have been used to analyze and characterize the differentially expressed proteins during HCC development.Results:HCC initiation and tumorigenesis were observed at one and four months post carcinogen treatment, respectively. One of the differentially-expressed proteins, namely, cytosolic phospholipase A2 delta was significantly up-regulated at very early stage of HCC development. Its expression continued to increase during cancer progression and hepatotumorigenesis stages. Its elevated expression has been confirmed by Western blot analysis. Consistent to this, analyses of the sera in the clinically confirmed liver cancer patients showed elevated expression of this protein, further validating our experimental results.Conclusion:This study suggests that elevation in the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 delta is associated with progression of HCC.
