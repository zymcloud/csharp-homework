Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are an attractive tool for delivering membrane-impermeable compounds, including anionic biomacromolecules such as DNA and RNA, into living cells. Amphipathic helical peptides composed of hydrophobic amino acids and cationic amino acids are typical CPPs. In the current study, we designed amphipathic helical 12-mer peptides containing α,α-disubstituted α-amino acids (dAAs), which are known to stabilize peptide secondary structures. The dominant secondary structures of peptides in aqueous solution differed according to the introduced dAAs. Peptides containing hydrophobic dAAs and adopting a helical structure exhibited a good cell-penetrating ability. As an application of amphipathic helical peptides, small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery into living human hepatoma cells was investigated. One of the peptides containing dAAs dipropylglycine formed stable complexes with siRNA at appropriate zeta-potential and size for intracellular siRNA delivery. This peptide showed effective RNA interference efficiency at short peptide length and low concentrations of peptide and siRNA. These findings will be helpful for the design of amphipathic helical CPPs as intracellular siRNA delivery.
