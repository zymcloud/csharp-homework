Redox-responsive theranostic nanoparticles based on poly-(N-Îµ-carbobenzyloxy-l-lysine) (PZLL) grafted hyaluronan (HA) (HA-g-SS-PZLL) copolymers were constructed for hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and therapy. These hyaluronan derivatives formed nanoparticles via a self-assembly process in aqueous solution at low concentration. Theranostic nanoparticles were obtained after loading hydrophobic doxorubicin (DOX) and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) into the core of the nanoparticles via a dialysis method. Theranostic nanoparticles exhibited redox triggered DOX release behavior, and faster DOX released from theranostic nanoparticles was detected under a reducing environment compared with slow DOX release under a normal physiological environment. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), flow cytometry and Prussian blue staining against HepG2 cells demonstrated that HA-g-SS-PZLL theranostic nanoparticles were capable of delivering DOX and SPIO into the cells. The analysis of the anticancer effect revealed that the HA-g-SS-PZLL theranostic nanoparticles shown higher cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells than DOX-loaded HA-g-PZLL nanoparticles. In vitro T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results exhibited that theranostic nanoparticles showed a good contrast enhancement effect, and the r2 relaxivity value was approximately 231 Fe mM-1 s-1. Finally, the theranostic nanoparticles acted as nanoprobes for HepG2 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice for in vivo MRI. Therefore, HA-g-SS-PZLL copolymers have great potential as theranostic nanoparticles for tumor-targeted diagnosis and treatment.
