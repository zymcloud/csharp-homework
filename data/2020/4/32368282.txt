The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM4 has been reported to regulate the assembly of the antiviral signalling complex, induce mitochondrial aggregation and sensitize cells to H2O2-induced death. However, the relationship between TRIM4 and human malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is unclear. In this study, we detected the expression of TRIM4 in 134 pairs of HCC tissues and peritumoural tissues and investigated the association of TRIM4 expression with the prognosis of HCC. We found that the TRIM4 expression was much lower in HCC tissues than in peritumoural tissues and was significantly associated with vascular invasion, tumour capsule and Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC) stage. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the TRIM4 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in our HCC cohort. Patients with higher TRIM4 expression had a lower incidence of intrahepatic recurrence and a higher OS rate (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). These results were further validated in another independent cohort of 200 HCC patients. In conclusion, the TRIM4 level in HCC tissues is an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Close clinical monitoring is recommended for patients with low TRIM4 expression.
