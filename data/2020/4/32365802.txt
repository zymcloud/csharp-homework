Leukamenin E is a natural ent-kaurane diterpenoid isolated from Isodon racemosa (Hemsl) Hara that has been found to be a novel and potential keratin filament inhibitor, but its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we show that leukamenin E induces keratin filaments (KFs) depolymerization, largely independently of microfilament (MFs) and microtubules (MTs) in well-spread cells and inhibition of KFs assembly in spreading cells. These effects are accompanied by keratin phosphorylation at K8-Ser73/Ser431 and K18-Ser52 via the by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway in primary liver carcinoma cells (PLC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, leukamenin E increases soluble pK8-Ser73/Ser431, pK18-Ser52, and pan-keratin in the cytoplasmic supernatant by immunofluorescence imaging and Western blotting assay. Accordingly, leukamenin E inhibits the spreading and migration of cells. We propose that leukamenin E-induced keratin phosphorylation may interfere with the initiation of KFs assembly and block the formation of a new KFs network, leading to the inhibition of cell spreading. Leukamenin E is a potential target drug for inhibition of KFs assembly.
