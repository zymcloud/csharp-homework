Recently, treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have expanded due to the development of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ramucirumab and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is the standard therapy for intermediate-stage HCC; however, in cases with anatomical problems, normal approaches are not possible. In such rare cases, direct hepatic puncture may be considered as an effective therapy and an indispensable treatment. We report our novel method of direct hepatic artery puncture in this case report. In 2011 and 2017, we reported 2 cases in the journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology in Japanese. This therapy is difficult and is associated with a high risk of complications; however, we succeeded in both cases in a similar way. We believe this method may provide an alternative treatment when standard treatment is not possible or when urgent therapy is required. In case 1, direct hepatic artery puncture was performed under ultrasonographic guidance, and we were able to control the disease with percutaneous lipiodol chemotherapy. Case 2 was an emergency case of ruptured HCC. Direct hepatic puncture successfully stopped tumor bleeding; furthermore, tumor necrosis also occurred, as seen on the enhanced computed tomography image. Our new method requires advanced puncture techniques and is not the treatment of choice if there are other safe alternatives available. However, it can be considered as an option if there are no other viable, effective treatments.
