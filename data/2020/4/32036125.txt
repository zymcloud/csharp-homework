The effect of selective transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE) using trisacryl gelatine microspheres (TGMs) in the normal canine liver was investigated. Selective embolisation was achieved by injecting TGMs into the left hepatic artery through a microcatheter in four healthy dogs. After embolisation, computed tomography (CT), biochemical analysis and histological examination were performed during a 12-week observation period. Embolisation was successful in all four dogs. Postoperative CT revealed consistent embolisation of the artery within the experimental period in three dogs. Hepatic enzyme levels slightly increased after embolisation but tapered to normal ranges. Histological examinations revealed no abnormal changes. Thus, selective TAE with TGMs was well tolerated in normal dogs and may be applicable to canine hepatocellular carcinoma.
