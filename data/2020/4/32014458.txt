Extracellular communication in the tumor microenvironment is critical. Results of qRT-PCR show that circ-0051443 is significantly lower in the plasma exosomes and tissues from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than healthy controls. Compared with the producer cells, circ-0051443 is mainly packaged into exosomes. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) shows that the patients with HCC can be distinguished from the controls by exosomal circ-0051443. The role of exosomal circ-0051443 in HCC was determined by animal and cell analyses. Circ-0051443 is transmitted from normal cells to HCC cells via exosomes and suppresses the malignant biological behaviors by promoting cell apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle. Exosomal circ-0051443 decreases the weight and volume of the xenograft tumors in nude mice via BAK1 upregulation in these tumors. BAK1 expression is mediated by exosomal circ-0051443 through competitive bound to miR-331-3p. Therefore, exosomal circ-0051443 can serve as a predictor and potential therapeutic target for HCC.
