Background:Tumor recurrence in patients after surgery severely reduces the survival rate of surgical patients. Targeting and killing recurrent tumor cells and tissues is extremely important for the cancer treatment.Results:Herein, we designed a nano-biomimetic photothermal-controlled drug-loading platform HepM-TSL with good targeting ability and immunocompatibility for the treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. HepM-TSL can accurately target the recurrent tumor area with the aid of the cloaked homotypic cell membrane and release the chemotherapy drugs in a controlled manner. In vivo results have confirmed that HepM-TSL loaded with drugs and photosensitizer achieves the synergistic treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma with good therapeutic effect and slight side effects.Conclusion:Accordingly, HepM-TSL provides a sound photothermal-chemotherapy synergistic strategy for the treatment of other recurrent cancers besides of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.
