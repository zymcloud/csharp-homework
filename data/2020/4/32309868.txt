Here, we report a case of a 73-year-old man with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma. Follow-up abdominal computed tomography showed a 1.7-cm-sized hyperenhancing mass in the right paracolic gutter, suspicious of metastasis. Histologic and immunohistochemical study of the resected specimen revealed extragenitourinary ectopic prostatic tissue. Since ectopic prostatic tissue is very rare, preoperative diagnosis is difficult but important for avoiding unnecessary treatment or patient anxiety. Here, we present a rare case of ectopic prostatic tissue in the right paracolic gutter.
