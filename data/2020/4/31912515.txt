Introduction:Although the laparoscopy liver resection (LLR) has become a useful approach for minor resections, it seems that lesions in posterosuperior (PS) segments still represent technical challenges. We report a series of robotic approach as an alternative option for these lesions, and a systematic review of the literature to show its feasibility.Methods:Consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for solitary lesions in PS segments by da Vinci SI robot, and by the same team. A systematic review of the literature was made to evaluate the feasibility of a robotic approach for PS hepatectomies.Results:From April 2016 to April 2017, five cases of robotic nonanatomical PS resections of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) were performed. A systematic review encountered five articles plus this series reporting outcomes for this approach. Briefly, a total of five patients in our series underwent this approach, all females, and one patient presented a grade 2 complication.Conclusion:Robotic hepatectomy seems to be a useful and valid strategy to resect lesions on PS hepatic segments simplifying liver-sparing hepatectomies. Even though the operative time is still high, the short length of stay, low number of complications and the low need for blood transfusions seems to surpass the intrinsic cost of robotic surgery.
