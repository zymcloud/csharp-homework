Backgrounds:The Child-Pugh score is a scoring system used to measure liver function and predict postoperative outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, the Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade has been proposed for the evaluation of hepatic reserve function in HCC. This study aimed to assess and compare the capability of ALBI grade and Child-Pugh score in predicting overall survival (OS).Methods:A total of 196 consecutive HCC patients who treated with hepatectomy were enrolled in this retrospective study. The prognostic values of ALBI grade and Child-Pugh score in predicting postoperative OS were respectively estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and time-dependent receiver operating curves (ROC). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate the prognostic factors for OS.Results:Stratified by the Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) system, there were 81 (41.3%) patients with grade 1 and 115 (58.7%) patients with grade 2. The cumulative 1-, 3-, 5-year OS rates in patients with ALBI-1 were 82.7%, 51.5% and 35.5%, respectively. For patients with ALBI-2, the cumulative 1-, 3-, 5-year OS rates were 57.6%, 19.4% and 0%, respectively. Based on the Child-Pugh classification, 136 (69.4%) patients had a score of 5, and 60 (30.6%) patients had a score of 6. Patients with Child-Pugh-A5 showed a better OS than those with Child-Pugh-A6, with respective OS at 1, 3 and 5 years (72.7%, 29.2%, 20.3% vs. 53.9%, 21.1%, 0%, Log-rank P<0.001). Besides, the ALBI grade revealed two prognostic groups within Child-Pugh-A5 (P<0.001), while the Child-Pugh score did not distinguish ALBI-2 in different prognostic groups (P=0.705). The multivariate analysis indicated that both ALBI grade and Child-Pugh score could significantly stratify the patients with different OS [hazard ratio (HR), 3.088 and 1.783; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.985 to 4.805 and 1.272 to 2.731; P<0.001 and P=0.032 for ALBI grade and Child-Pugh score, respectively]. Additionally, time-dependent ROC analysis in the entire cohort proved that the ALBI grade had a better discriminatory ability than the Child-Pugh score in predicting survival, especially for long-term outcomes. According to the subgroup analyses, the ALBI grade had a better discriminatory ability and survival prediction accuracy in overall subsets than the Child-Pugh score for the prediction of OS.Conclusions:ALBI grade supplied better prognostic performance and distribution of liver function than Child-Pugh score in stratifying prognosis for HCC patients treated by hepatectomy. These results declared that ALBI grade could be an alternative liver function grading system for stratification in patients with HCC.
