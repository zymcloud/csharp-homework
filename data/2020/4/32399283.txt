Liver malignancies include primary and metastatic tumors. Limited progress has been achieved in improving the survival rate of patients with advanced stage liver cancer and who are unsuitable for surgery. Apart from surgery, chemoradiotherapy, trans-arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation, a novel therapeutic modality is needed for the clinical treatment of liver cancer. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a novel strategy for treating patients with advanced cancers; it uses a light-triggered cytotoxic photosensitizer and a laser light. PDT provides patients with a potential treatment approach with minimal invasion and low toxicity, that is, the whole course of treatment is painless, harmless, and repeatable. Therefore, PDT has been considered an effective palliative treatment for advanced liver cancers. To date, PDT has been used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatoblastoma and liver metastases. Clinical outcomes reveal that PDT can be considered a promising treatment modality for all liver cancers to improve the quality and quantity of life of patients. Despite the advances achieved with this approach, several challenges still impede the application of PDT to liver malignancies. In this review, we focus on the recent advancements and discuss the future prospects of PDT in treating liver malignancies.
