Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common lethal cancer, and there is a need for effective therapies. Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) has been increasingly used, but is not supported by guidelines due to a lack of solid evidence.Aims:Determine the efficacy and safety of SIRT in HCC across the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages A, B, and C.Methods:Consecutive patients that received SIRT between 2006 and 2016 at two centers in Canada were evaluated.Results:We analyzed 132 patients, 12 (9%), 62 (47%), and 58 (44%) belonged to BCLC stages A, B, and C; mean age was 61.2 (SD Â± 9.2), and 89% were male. Median survival was 12.4 months (95% CI 9.6-16.6), and it was different across the stages: 59.7 (95% CI NA), 12.8 (95% CI 10.2-17.5), and 9.3 months (95% CI 5.9-11.8) in BCLC A, B, and C, respectively (p = 0.009). Independent factors associated with survival were previous HCC treatment (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.23-3.27, p = 0.005), bi-lobar disease (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.30-3.89, p = 0.003), ascites (HR 1.77, 95% CI 0.99-3.13, p = 0.05), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20, p = 0.01), Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade-3 (HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.22-5.92, p = 0.01), tumor thrombus (HR 2.95, 95% CI 1.65-5.24, p Conclusions:SIRT has the potential to be used across the BCLC stages in cases with preserved liver function. When using it as a rescue treatment, one should consider variables reflecting liver function, HCC extension, and systemic inflammation, which are associated with mortality.
