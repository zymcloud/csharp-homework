Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death induced by lipid peroxidation that is dependent on iron. This pathway is being considered as an alternative anticancer therapeutic strategy, and the chemoreagent erastin induces ferroptosis by blocking system Xc-, which causes a cysteine shortage that depletes intracellular GSH. Mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) is major enzyme that produces NADPH, which is a crucial source for mitochondrial GSH turnover. Therefore, we hypothesized that down-regulation of IDH2 would have a synergic effect on erastin-induced ferroptosis. Here, we investigated the effect of IDH2 knockdown on ferroptosis in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma and murine Hepa1-6 hepatoma cells cultured in vitro as well as in an in vivo model of allografted Hepa1-6 cells in nude mice. Our results show that susceptibility to ferroptosis was substantially increased when IDH2 was down-regulated. This study supports that IDH2 has protective effect against ferroptotic cell death, and that the enzyme could be targeted to sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis.
