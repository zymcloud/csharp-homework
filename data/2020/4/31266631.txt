Background:The impact of antiviral therapy on long-term survival outcomes in patients with small HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-related HCC) after liver resection is still controversial, as the impact can be overshadowed by tumor-related factors. This study investigated this impact on recurrence and survival in patients with HCC of less than 3 cm.Objective:This study was designed to further determine the impact of antiviral treatment on prognosis of patients with HCC after liver resection, to verify whether patients with cirrhosis still benefited from antiviral treatment, to study the impact of antiviral treatment on post-operative HCC recurrence, and to determine whether patients with a low preoperative HBV-DNA viral load should receive antiviral therapy.Methods:The clinical data on patients who underwent curative liver resection for histopathologically confirmed small HCC (â‰¤3 cm in diameter) were analyzed to determine factors which were related with HCC recurrence and survival. The disease-free and overall survival outcomes were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of long-term survival.Results:Of the 795 patients in this study, patients with high preoperative HBV-DNA levels had significantly worse DFS and OS outcomes at 1-, 3- and 5- year after liver resection when compared with those with low HBV-DNA levels (86.1%, 60.8%, 46.6% vs 90.5%, 71.3%, 51.4%; and 98.5%, 89.3%, 75.2% vs 98.8%, 91.5%, 84%, respectively). Patients who received antiviral therapy had significantly better DFS and OS outcomes at 1-, 3- and 5- year after liver resection when compared with those without (91.6%, 69.5%, 55% vs 80.2%, 56%, 44.2%; and 99.6%, 93.5%, 87% vs 96.1%, 80.5%, 61.3%, respectively). Antiviral therapy significantly improved the OS but not DFS outcomes in patients with low HBV-DNA levels. The corresponding 1-, 3- and 5- year DFS and OS outcomes were 92.6%, 73%, 59.1% vs 87.1%, 68.5%, 57.9%; and 99.5%, 95.1%, 91.1% vs 97.6%, 85.5%, 72.4%, respectively. Antiviral treatment significantly prolonged DFS and OS in patients with cirrhosis. The corresponding 1-, 3- and 5- year DFS and OS were 90.2%, 66%, 49% vs 73.9%, 46.6%, 32.8%; and 100%, 93.6%, 85% vs 93.8%, 73.3%, 52.6%, respectively.Conclusion:Antiviral therapy improved the prognosis of small HBV-related HCC of less than 3 cm. The survival benefit was also detected in patients with cirrhosis. Antiviral therapy should be considered a routine post-operative therapy for patients with HBV-related HCC.
