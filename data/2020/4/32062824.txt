In the past decades, the roles of carbohydrates in living organisms and their potential use in many fields have been extensively investigated. Sialyl Lewis x (sLex), a member of body carbohydrate, is an inherent blood-type tetrasaccharide on the surface of different cells, the lymphocyte, neutrophil, some T cells, multiple tumor cells and so on. SLex is a common ligand of the three selectins, L-selectin, E-selectin and P-selectin, and plays important roles in multiple physiological phenomenas by interacting with selectins. Under normal physiological conditions, sLex can affect the immune process and fertilization process. Lower expression of sLex could cause leukocyte adhesion defects (LAD) II. Overexpression of sLex on the other hand has been linked to several cancers including melanoma, breast, pancreatic, liver, lung, head and neck, ovarian, bladder carcinomas and some blood disease including Hodgkin disease, some B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias, acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and most acute nonlymphocytic leukemias. This paper mainly reviews the physiological functions and pathological effects of sLex and its applications in disease diagnosis, drug delivery, gene transfer and medical molecular imaging. We aim to help researchers and other readers quickly grasp the physiological and pathological roles and its medical applications of sLex, and give some suggestions for research directions.
