Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. Ample data have been reported to unravel the carcinogenesis over the past decades. Although pinpointing the cause of the HCC is challenging, this in and of itself may not be an insuperable problem. Indeed, the emergence of novel molecular targets has given rise to targeted therapy for HCC. Compared to traditional treatments, drugs with molecularly targeted agents are considered an optimal way to treat HCC. However, targeted approaches are currently limited among HCC patients. In our work, we explored more potential genes for targeted treatment of HCC. Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) and NetworkAnalyst. Subsequently, 10 key genes were selected through enrichment analysis and PPI network construction. Based on the GEPIA and Oncomine databases, six upregulated genes were selected. High protein expression of these six genes were confirmed through the Human Protein Atlas database. In addition, these six genes were associated with unfavorable overall survival and progression-free survival based on Kaplan-Meier plotter bioinformatics. Moreover, gene expression was closely related to the tumor stages and pathological grades, as determined with UALCAN. More importantly, PTTG1, UBE2C, and ZWINT were identified as potential targets of anti-cancer drugs using cBioPortal. qPCR and western blot assays were used to show the high expression levels of the latter three genes in HCC cell lines. Collectively, these findings are expected to provide a theoretical basis for and give novel insights into clinical research of HCC.
