Organ transplant recipients are not routinely included in clinical trials, and as a result there is a paucity of data to guide clinicians in the treatment of malignancies in this unique patient population. This is a case report and focused review of the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with orthotopic liver transplants. We describe a single patient's treatment over a period of 4 years from the time of diagnosis to submission of this case report. We submit evidence that the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab can produce a durable response, with a tolerable adverse event profile and without associated allograft rejection.
