Aim:To assess AB-BEZ235-NP potential as a radio-sensitizer in hepatocellular carcinoma models.Method:By comparing hepatocellular carcinoma cell with simple radiation or combined AB-BEZ235-NP therapy, the HCC apoptosis and self-repair level have significant differences in mortality rates and cell migration abilities.Results:Cell proliferation and DNA damage increased by pretreatment with AB-BEZ235-NP after irradiation; further studies on the repair pathway indicated that AB-BEZ235-NP inhibited the important pathway of DSB repair. Our results further show that AB-BEZ235-NP significantly inhibits the phosphorylation of the canonical protein, γ-H2AX, in the NHEJ DSB repair pathway and Serine Protein Kinase (SPK) ATM, and TP53-Binding Protein one. More importantly, AB-BEZ235-NP increased the mount of mean γ-H2AX Foci in irradiated cells, indicating that AB-BEZ235-NP can selectively inhibit DSB repair in HCC cells. Therefore, these results clearly eludicate that treatment with AB-BEZ235-NP is a potential promising therapy which can increase the radiosensitivity to HCC.
