Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide and prognosis for patients with the disease remains poor. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage and are only eligible for palliative therapy. As a novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR2-TKI), apatinib has a certain antitumor effect for a variety of solid tumors. In clinical practice, clinicians have attempted to treat intermediate- to advanced-stage HCC patients with a combination of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and apatinib. However, a consensus on the therapeutic effects of this treatment is yet to be reached. This meta-analysis was conducted to compare the therapeutic efficacy and clinical safety of the combination therapy of TACE plus apatinib with that of TACE alone in patients with intermediate- to advanced-stage HCC.Methods:Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) and the reference lists of retrieved articles up to July 31, 2019. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to express the therapeutic effects of TACE plus apatinib versus TACE on survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, progressive disease rate and adverse events using a mixed-effect model. Subgroup analyses of study type, dosage of apatinib, TACE regimen, study sample size between treatment groups and control groups were performed. Publication bias was assessed using fail-safe N, Begg-Mazumdar test and Egger's test.Results:From 23 eligible studies, a total of 1,342 patients were included in this review and meta-analysis. Among these studies, 18 were randomized clinical trials and 5 were case-control studies. Compared with those being treated with TACE alone, patients receiving TACE plus apatinib showed significantly better half-year survival (OR, 2.741, 95% CI, 1.745-4.306) and 1-year survival (OR, 2.284, 95% CI, 1.442-3.620). The superiority of TACE and apatinib over TACE monotherapy was evident in the disease control rate (OR, 2.919, 95% CI, 2.184-3.903), objective response rate (OR, 2.683, 95% CI, 2.099-3.429) and progressive disease rate (OR, 0.341, 95% CI, 0.255-0.456), respectively.Conclusions:The combination treatment of apatinib and TACE provides better survival benefits for intermediate- to advanced-stage HCC patients when compared to TACE monotherapy and should be recommended for suitable patients with unresectable HCC. However, further investigation into future prospective clinical studies is warranted.
