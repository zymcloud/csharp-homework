Serous cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a rare but well-established entity. The origin and evolution of this disorder remain unclear, but even metastatic cases have an excellent prognosis. These tumors are very similar to benign serous cystic neoplasms (SCNs) of the pancreas, except that they tend to be larger, are locally invasive, and present distant metastasis. The most frequent local invasion is adjacent vessels, spleen, stomach, and duodenum. The most common site of distant metastasis is the liver. Diagnosis via imaging as well as pathology examination may be misguided due to atypical characteristics of the tumor. In fact, in some, the diagnosis of malignancy was established only after metastases were detected. We present a 60-year-old female patient with malignant serous microcystic cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas and liver metastasis that was initially misdiagnosed as a metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The patient underwent tumor resection and liver metastasectomy and she is currently doing well after three years of follow-up, with no tumor recurrence or new metastatic liver nodules based on imaging findings.
