Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which affects over 20% of the adult population, is the most common liver disease worldwide and can progress to inflammatory hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer. The need to alleviate NAFLD is imperative, but there are limited pharmacological therapies available. Based on previous reports that piceatannol, a stilbenoid metabolite of resveratrol, exhibits anti-obesity, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, the goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of piceatannol on prevention and/or treatment of NAFLD. The results showed that piceatannol significantly decreased fat accumulation and suppressed lipogenesis and fatty acids (FAs) uptake by decreasing sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) in steatosis-induced HepG2 hepatocytes. Piceatannol treatment also promoted FAs β-oxidation by increasing farnesoid X receptor (FXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT1α) under steatosis conditions. Moreover, piceatannol significantly suppressed FA-induced oxidative stress and inhibited phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). Overall, it is suggested that piceatannol reduced fat accumulation in steatosis-induced HepG2 cells by suppressing lipogenesis (SREBP1 and ACC) and FA uptake (CD36), and promoting FAs oxidation (FXR, PPARα and CPT1α).
