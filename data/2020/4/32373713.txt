Background:Although choledochal cyst disease is seen predominantly in childhood, it is becomingly increasingly diagnosed in adult patients.Methods:Data of 36 patients with choledochal cysts managed in our institute between January 2010 and December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed.Results:Median age at presentation was 37 years (range: 13-72 years). Female-to-male ratio was 3.5 : 1. All patients were symptomatic, and abdominal pain was the most common symptom. 72.2% had other associated conditions. There was a considerable delay from the onset of symptoms to referral, median duration being 348 days. There were 28 cases of type I (77.8%), 5 cases of type IVA (13.9%), and 3 cases of type IVB (8.3%). Cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed in 29 (80.55%) cases. This procedure was combined with a left lateral sectionectomy, left hepatectomy, and radical cholecystectomy in 1, 2, and 1 cases, respectively. Lilly's technique was used in 2 cases, and cyst excision with hepaticoduodenostomy was performed in 1 case. Early complications were seen in 21 patients (58.3%), and late complications were seen in 5 patients (13.8%). 2 patients were found to have associated malignancies. One patient was detected to have cholangiocarcinoma in the resected liver incidentally, and another patient was diagnosed to have gall bladder cancer intraoperatively.Conclusion:Choledochal cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adults presenting with epigastric or right hypochondrium pain or jaundice. A thorough preoperative evaluation is required. Cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy forms the standard treatment in most cases. Long-term follow-up is essential for management of complications and early detection of malignant change.
