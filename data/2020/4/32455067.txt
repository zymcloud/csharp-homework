Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a generally well-tolerated and safe procedure that is increasingly being used in the management of intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tumor rupture is a rare major complication of TACE. Predisposing factors for tumor rupture include large tumor size and peripherally located tumors; in cases of HCC in cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), tumor rupture may occur more frequently because of the phenomenon of peliosis that occurs in AIH leading to higher propensity to rupture. Management of tumor rupture can be surgical or conservative depending on the individual case. We describe the first documented case of tumor rupture post-TACE in a patient with AIH cirrhosis and HCC.
