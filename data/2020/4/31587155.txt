Background:Ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) is described as a key subunit of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyl transferase complex, which plays an important role in the prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy drugs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) is a member of the sirtuin family that is deubiquitinated by USP22. However, it is still unknown whether USP22 and SIRT1 co-expression is associated with disease progression and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance in HCC.Methods:141 patients who received hepatectomy at our hospital from January 2010 to December 2014 were enrolled in this study. The expression of USP22 and SIRT1 was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Clinicopathological features, including age, gender, tumor number, tumor size, tumor differentiation, tumor stage, alpha-fetoprotein and microscopic vascular invasion, were assessed. Further experiments confirmed the role of SIRT1 in 5-FU drug resistance in vivo.Results:Immunohistochemical staining showed that the high expression of USP22 and SIRT1 was frequently observed in HCC tissues relative to normal liver tissues. Overexpression of USP22 is associated with microscopic vascular invasion (MVI). Further analysis showed that the co-expression of USP22 and SIRT1 was more effective in predicting the prognosis of HCC. The SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 dramatically inhibited the expression of Cyclin B1 and resistance-associated protein 3 (MRP3) to reduce 5-FU drug resistance in vivo.Conclusion:These findings suggest that the co-expression of USP22 and SIRT1 is significantly associated with unfavorable HCC progression. The inhibition of SIRT1 in vivo could be valuable in improving 5-FU drug sensitivity and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis.
