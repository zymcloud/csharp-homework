The case presented is a 72-year-old male with no history of hepatitis B or C. Dynamic CT revealed a 2 cm mass in the liver (S8), with arterial phase hyperenhancement and delayed phase washout. The patient underwent an open S8 subsegmentectomy. The mass was pathologically diagnosed as well-to-moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma(T2N0M0, Stage â…¡). At 2 years 10 months postoperatively, MRI showed a 4 cm mass in contact with the pancreatic head, inferior vena cava, and duodenum. The mass had moderate FDG uptake on PET scan, and early phase hyperenhancement and delayed phase washout on dynamic CT. We performed laparoscopic mass resection, suspecting lymph node metastasis of the hepatocellular carcinoma, which was confirmed by the pathological diagnosis. The patient has survived for 1 year without recurrence. Lymph node metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma is rare. It is unclear whether surgical resection is feasible in such cases. Here, we report a case of lymph node metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma resected by laparoscopic surgery.
