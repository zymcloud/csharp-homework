This study aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of chemokine-like factor-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing family member 2 (CMTM2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. Bioinformatics analysis showed that CMTM2 was downregulated in HCC tissues and correlated with vascular invasion of HCC patients. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) method found that CMTM2 expression was negative in 29/75 (38.67%) cases of HCC tissues and 13/75 (17.33%) cases of paracancerous tissues, also showed a significantly lower expression of CMTM2 in HCC tissues than the paired paracancerous tissues (p < 0.05). Moreover, CMTM2 expression was significantly correlated with tumor grade of HCC patients (p < 0.05), but had no relationship with other clinicopathological features. In addition, multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that tumor grade was an independent risk factor for CMTM2 expression. The survival time of HCC patients between high and low expression of CMTM2 had no difference by bioinformatics analysis, but the IHC result showed that the negative expression of CMTM2 was related to a poor prognosis of HCC patients. Further COX regression analysis showed that CMTM2 expression was an independent protective factor for the prognosis of HCC patients. We identify that CMTM2 is downregulated in HCC tissues and correlated with the prognosis of HCC patients, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role of CMTM2 in HCC progression.
