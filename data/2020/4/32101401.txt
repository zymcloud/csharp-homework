Expansile nanoparticles (eNPs) are a promising pH-responsive polymeric drug delivery vehicle, as demonstrated in multiple intraperitoneal cancer models. However, previous delivery routes were limited to intraperitoneal injection and to a single agent, paclitaxel. In this study, we preliminarily evaluate the biodistribution and in vivo toxicity of eNPs in mice after intravenous injection. The eNPs localize predominantly to the liver, without detectable acute toxicity in the liver or other key organs. On the basis of these results, we encapsulated FQI1, a promising lead compound for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, in eNPs. eNPs are taken up by cancerous and noncancerous human liver cells in vitro, although at different rates. FQI1-loaded eNPs release FQI1 in a pH-dependent manner and limit proliferation equivalently to unencapsulated FQI1 in immortalized hepatocytes in vitro. eNPs are a versatile platform delivery system for therapeutic compounds and have potential utility in the treatment of liver disease.
