Objective:The occurrence and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a multi-step complex process and the exact molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. LncRNA NEAT1 is involved in tumorigenesis and progression. However, the role of LncRNA NEAT1 in HCC remains unclear.Patients and methods:The tumor tissues and adjacent tissues of HCC patients were collected and LncRNA NEAT1 expression was detected by Real time PCR. The hepatoma cell line HepG2 was cultured and transfected with lnc RNA NEAT1 siRNA or lnc RNA NEAT1 plasmid followed by analysis of LncRNA NEAT1 expression, cell proliferation by MTT assay, as well as Caspase 3 activity. In addition, cell apoptosis and cell cycle were assessed by flow cytometry and cell invasion was measured by transwell chambers. The expression of EGFR, Bax and Bcl-2 was detected by Western blot.Results:LncRNA NEAT1 expression was significantly increased in HCC tissues compared with adjacent tissues (p Conclusions:LncRNA NEAT1 expression is increased in liver cancer tissues. Down-regulation of LncRNA NEAT1 can inhibit EGFR expression and promote hepatoma cell apoptosis, inhibit cell cycle, thus inhibiting tumor proliferation and invasion.
