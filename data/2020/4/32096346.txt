Background:To develop and validate nomograms that can be used to predict outcomes in individuals suffering alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) negative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical resection.Methods:A total of 509 AFP-negative HCC patients who received hepatectomy between January 2009 and March 2013 in our center were randomized into training and validation cohorts. Nomograms for both overall and recurrence-free survival (OS and RFS, respectively) were established based on the predictors in the training cohort. Nomograms performance and discriminative power were assessed with concordance index (C-index) values and decision curve analyses (DCA). The results were validated in the validation cohort.Results:Alkaline phosphatase, liver cirrhosis, tumor size, satellite lesions, microvascular invasion, and Edmondson-Steiner grade were significantly linked to OS and RFS. Sex and tumor number were additional predictors for RFS. The OS nomogram had a C-index value of 0.742, which was better than that for the AJCC eighth edition (0.632), BCLC system (0.553), and JIS score (0.557) (all P Conclusions:These nomograms presented more accurate prognostic prediction in patients with AFP-negative HCC after hepatectomy.
