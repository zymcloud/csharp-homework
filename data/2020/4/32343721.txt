Aim:Metabolic reprograming is crucial in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Canagliflozin (CANA), a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, affects various metabolisms. We investigated the effects of CANA on proliferation and metabolic reprograming of HCC cell lines using multi-omics analysis of metabolomics and absolute quantification proteomics (iMPAQT).Methods:The cells were counted 72 hours after treatment with CANA (10 μM; n = 5) or dimethyl sulfoxide (control [CON]; n = 5) in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. In Hep3B cells, metabolomics and iMPAQT were used to evaluate the levels of metabolites and metabolic enzymes in the CANA and CON groups (each n = 5) 48 hours after treatment.Results:Seventy-two hours after treatment, the number of cells in the CANA group was significantly decreased compared to that in the CON group in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. On multi-omics analysis, there was a significant difference in the levels of 85 metabolites and 68 metabolic enzymes between the CANA and CON groups. For instance, CANA significantly downregulated ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha, a mitochondrial electron transport system protein (CON 297.28±20.63 vs. CANA 251.83±22.83 fmol/10 μg protein; P = 0.0183). CANA also significantly upregulated 3-hydroxybutyrate, a beta-oxidation metabolite (CON 530±14 vs. CANA 854±68 arbitrary units; PConclusions:We found that CANA suppressed the proliferation of HCC cells through alterations in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism. Thus, CANA may suppress the proliferation of HCC by regulating metabolic reprograming.
