Purpose:We aim to provide results of the real-world experience of a single center in Lebanon on the use of radioembolization to treat liver-only or liver-dominant tumors. Methods: This retrospective review included patients who were evaluated for radioembolization between January 2015 and June 2017 and who had a lung shunt fraction of 20% or less. Tumor responses were determined using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST).Results:Of the 23 Arab patients with a median age of 64 years (range, 36-87 years), eight had hepatocellular carcinoma, four had cholangiocarcinoma, and 11 had liver-only or liver-dominant metastases from other primary cancers. Most (n=17) had multifocal lesions, and 13 had a history of branched (n=8) or main (n=5) portal vein thrombosis. When appropriate, the gastroduodenal artery and middle hepatic artery were embolized for consolidation of radiotherapy; 18 patients required arterial coil occlusion, two had their cystic artery occluded, and one developed cholecystitis, which was successfully treated with antibiotics and supportive care. Another patient developed a post-radioembolization complication-a peptic ulcer unrelated to arterial reflux of microspheres because both the gastroduodenal and right gastric arteries were occluded. The median time to progression was seven months (range, 3-36 months), and median overall survival from radioembolization was 12 months (range, 3-40 months). Tumor responses included five complete responses, 13 partial responses, one stable disease, and four cases of progressive disease. Conclusion: Performing radioembolization in a non-referral, private center in Lebanon resulted in good patient outcomes with few complications.
