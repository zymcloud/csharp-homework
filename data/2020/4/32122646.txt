Matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) has been found to play multiple biological roles in cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Up to now, its expression, clinicopathological and prognostic implications in HCC have not been comprehensively investigated. In the present study, MMP14 expression was detected, using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining, in paired HCC and adjacent liver (AL) samples from 260 patients who underwent radical hepatectomy. The associations of MMP14 staining H-scores with clinicopathological parameters, overall and disease-free survival were then evaluated. Finally, its expression and prognostic value were confirmed in some online publicly available databases. It was shown that MMP14 expression was significantly higher in HCC than in AL tissues (p=0.035). Furthermore, MMP14 expression correlated positively with tumour size, Edmondson-Steiner grade and Î±-fetoprotein level (p
