Background:To evaluate the utility of non-invasive parameters derived from T1 mapping and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for predicting microvascular invasion (MVI) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 94 patients with single HCC undergoing partial hepatectomy was analyzed in this retrospective study. Preoperative T1 mapping and DWI on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI was performed. The parameters including precontrast, postcontrast and reduction rate of T1 relaxation time and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured for differentiating MVI-positive HCCs (n = 38) from MVI-negative HCCs (n = 56). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was analyzed to compare the diagnostic performance of the calculated parameters.Results:MVI-positive HCCs demonstrated a significantly lower reduction rate of T1 relaxation time than that of MVI-negative HCCs (39.4% vs 49.9, P 2. To achieve a better diagnostic performance, the criteria of combining the reduction rate lower than 44.9% and the ADC value lower than 1553.5 s/mm2 was proposed with a high specificity of 91.8% and accuracy of 80.9%.Conclusions:The proposed criteria of combining the reduction rate of T1 relaxation time lower than 44.9% and the ADC value lower than 1553.5 s/mm2 on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI holds promise for evaluating MVI status of HCC.
