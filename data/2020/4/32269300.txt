A total of 185 cases (150 retrospectively and 35 prospectively) of malignant liver masses were collected. In the retrospectively collected cases hyperenhancement during wash-in was the most common feature in HCCs but there was a high percentage of cases showing no enhancement or hypo/isoenhancement. ICCs displayed a large variety of contrast enhancement patterns and, although statically significant differences between ICCs and HCCs were evident, no clear distinction between these two pathologies was possible based only on their CEUS appearance. Sarcomas displayed all the possible degrees of wash-in enhancement with non-enhancing being the most common appearance. Metastases displayed all the possible contrast-enhancement patterns, with the most common being hyperenhancement in the wash-in phase followed by hypoenhancement in the wash-out phase. A decision tree was developed based on the features of the retrospectively selected cases. Based on the developed decision tree 27/35 prospectively collected cases were correctly classified. Even if some significant differences among groups were evident, all the histotypes displayed all the possible patterns of contrast enhancement, and, therefore, the differentiation of liver masses in dogs based only on their CEUS features is not feasible and, therefore, cytology or histopathology is required.
