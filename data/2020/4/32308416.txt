Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and its incidence tends to increase globally. Current biomarkers can hardly reflect diagnostic significance and therapeutic efficiency accurately. The role of collagen 24A1 (COL24A1) in HCC, as a member of the collagen family, remains unclear and needs to be proved.Methods:HCC-associated RNA sequencing datasets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and Oncomine databases. R language was used to screen and analyze the differential expression genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology (GO) pathway analyses of DEGs were carried out using g:profiler. Then, the STRING database and cytoscape software were applied to estimate the correlations between DEGs. GEPIA and HCCDB database were used to verify and analyze these results. Finally, qPCR and immunohistochemistry staining on clinical samples and HCC cell lines were conducted to further verify the above results.Results:The expression of COL24A1 in HCC tissues was significantly higher than that in normal hepatic (NH) tissues. The analysis of TCGA and Oncomine database samples proved that COL24A1 expression was connected with tumor grade, tumor stage and pathologic stage. Meanwhile, the overall survival (OS) curve also validated that high expression of COL24A1 indicated poor prognosis. And the above results have been verified in our clinical samples and HCC cell lines. Furthermore, there is a significant increase of the expression of COL24A1 in various tumors. COL24A1, together with other interactive proteins, has a significant effect on the prognosis of HCC.Conclusion:Overall, COL24A1 may be an oncogene in the development of HCC. Also, the overexpression of COL24A1 in HCC may help diagnose HCC and evaluate prognosis.
