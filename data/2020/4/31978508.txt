Background:Globally, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Recently, many studies have demonstrated that small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) was closely related to HCC.Objective:To explore whether snoRNA can be used as a molecular target for HCC.Methods:The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for the published literatures related to snoRNA and HCC until August 12, 2019. After identification, screening, and verification, this study finally included 26 studies correlating small nucleolar RNA host gene (SNHG) and HCC, and 8 studies correlating snoRNA and HCC. Based on the collation of the relevant literature, the correlation network diagram between snoRNAs and HCC was constructed.Results:The SNHGs, such as SNHG1, SNHG6, SNHG16, and SNHG20 can play varied roles in HCC through different regulatory mechanisms. These SNHGs can promote and inhibit tumorigenesis. SNORD76 can promote the proliferation of tumor tissues and cells in vitro through different pathways. SnoU2_19 and SNORD76 can function through the same pathway. SNHG3, SNHG20, SNHG6, SNORD76, and snoRA47 can modulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to regulate the development of HCC cell or tissue. SNHG16, SNORD76, and SnoU2_19 can regulate the development of HCC through Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.Conclusion:snoRNA can regulate the occurrence of HCC by modulating multiple molecular signaling pathways. Hence, snoRNA can be a potential molecular target for HCC.
