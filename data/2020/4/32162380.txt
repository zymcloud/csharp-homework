Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary liver malignancy with a high global prevalence and a dismal prognosis. Studies are urgently needed to examine the molecular pathogenesis and biological characteristics of HCC. Chromatin remodelling, an integral component of the DNA damage response, protects against DNA damage-induced genome instability and tumorigenesis by triggering the signalling events that activate the interconnected DNA repair pathways. The SWI/SNF complexes are one of the most extensively investigated adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes, and mutations in genes encoding SWI/SNF subunits are frequently observed in various human cancers, including HCC. The mutated SWI/SNF complex subunits exert dual functions by accelerating or inhibiting HCC initiation and progression. Furthermore, the abnormal SWI/SNF complexes influence the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes, as well as the differentiation, activation and recruitment of several immune cell types. In addition, they exhibit synergistic effects with immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of diverse tumour types. Therefore, understanding the mutations and deficiencies of the SMI/SNF complexes, together with the associated functional mechanisms, may provide a novel strategy to treat HCC through targeting the related genes or modulating the tumour microenvironment.
