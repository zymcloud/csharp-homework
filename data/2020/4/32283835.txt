Background:non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) recently headlined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. This study aims to unveil the role of some unaddressed critical players that might aid in understanding, predicting, and targeting NASH and NASH-HCC.Methods:Serum interleukin 13 (IL-13) levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within interleukin (IL)-13 rs20541, IL-13 receptors (IL-13R1) rs2248841, (IL-13R2) rs5946040, signal transducer activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) rs167769, yes-associated protein (YAP1) rs11225163, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) rs2282055, and programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) rs7854413 genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Multiple stepwise regression analysis was performed on a cohort of 134 Egyptian male patients diagnosed with NASH and NASH-HCC.Results:higher serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and higher serum IL-13 levels were directly associated with HCC development in NASH (odds ratio (OR) 19.6 and 1.9 p < 0.01). Reversibly, the presence of the C/C genotype in STAT6 rs167769 and the C allele carrier YAP1 rs11225163 were inversely associated with HCC in NASH patients (OR 0.015 and 0.047 p < 0.01). A predictive model was formulated with 97.5% specificity, 90.9% sensitivity, and 94.8% accuracy. Moreover, higher serum IL-13 levels and the presence of PD-L2 rs7854413 C allele carriers were associated with advanced fibrosis progression in NASH patients (OR 1.432 and 3.797 p < 0.01). Serum levels of IL-13 and C/C genotype in STAT6 rs167769 significantly increased the predictive capacity of serum AFP to predict HCC in F1-F2 and in F3-F4 fibrosis grades NASH patients.Conclusion:association between serum IL-13 and PD-L2 rs7854413 polymorphism successfully predict advanced fibrosis in NASH. However, HCC development in NASH is associated with higher serum AFP, IL-13 levels, and STAT6 rs167769, YAP1 rs11225163 polymorphisms.
