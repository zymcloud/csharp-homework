Background and aims:The Child-Pugh (CP) score is a widely used method to assess liver function and predict postoperative outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, the fibrosis index (FIB-4) has been demonstrated to be closely associated with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. This study aimed to compare the capability of FIB-4 index with CP score in predicting the outcomes for HCC patients after hepatectomy.Methods:A total of 495 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were enrolled. The performance of the FIB-4 index in predicting postoperative liver failure (PHLF) and overall survival was compared with that of the CP score.Results:Of them, 9.3% (46/495) patients developed PHLF. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the FIB-4 index for predicting PHLF was greater than that of the CP score (0.744 versus 0.621; P = 0.044). The optimal cutoff value of the FIB-4 index for predicting PHLF was 4.16. Multivariable analyses revealed that the FIB-4 index was an independent predictor of PHLF regardless of the hepatectomy subgroups, but the CP grade was only a significant predictor of PHLF in the minor hepatectomy subgroup. The FIB-4 index (4.16) stratified patients into two distinct overall survival cohorts (P = 0.006). The FIB-4 index also classified patients with the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages 0 and A into two distinct overall survival cohorts (P = 0.001 and P = 0.034, respectively).Conclusion:The FIB-4 index may be a better predictor of PHLF and overall survival in HCC patients with hepatectomy than CP score.
