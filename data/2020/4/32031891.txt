Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a common noncutaneous carcinoma worldwide with high morbidity and mortality. Effective prevention methods are far from being met. Both diagnostic and prognostic models that can precisely and accurately predict the status and survival time of COAD are urgently needed. In the field of COAD, there have been limited studies on molecular biomarkers that can predict disease status and prognosis. Hence, an important task is to identify these biomarkers. We aimed to identify important risk genes that have the ability not only to diagnose tumors but also to predict overall survival. A comprehensive analysis was performed in this study. Finally, carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1) and CA4 were identified as potential biomarkers due to their predictive roles in diagnosis and prognosis, and the results were further confirmed by a series of analyses. Overall, these findings are of great importance and may facilitate individualized treatment in diagnosis and prognosis.
