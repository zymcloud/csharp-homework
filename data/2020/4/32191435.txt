Nonspecific adsorption is of great concern for electrochemical biosensors performing in complex biological media, and various antifouling materials have been introduced into the sensing interfaces to improve the antifouling capability of different biosensors. However, for most of the biosensors with antifouling materials and sensing probes coexisting in the sensing interfaces, either the antifouling materials will impair the sensing performances or the sensing probes will affect the antifouling ability. Herein, a facile and efficient antifouling biosensor was developed based on a newly designed three-in-one peptide with anchoring, antifouling, and recognizing capabilities. One end of the designed peptide is a unique anchoring part that is rich in amine groups, and this part can be anchored to the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-citrate film electrodeposited on a glassy carbon electrode. The other end of the peptide is a recognizing part that can specifically bind to the aminopeptidase N (APN) and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2 cells). Meanwhile, the middle part of the peptide, together with the anchoring part, was designed to be antifouling. With this designed multifunctional peptide, highly sensitive and low-fouling biosensors capable of assaying target APN and HepG2 cells in complex biological media can be easily prepared, with detection limits of 0.4 ng·mL-1 and 20 cells·mL-1, respectively. This antifouling biosensor is feasible for practical target detection in real complex samples, and it is highly expected that this peptide designing strategy may be extended to the development of various antifouling biosensors.
