Purpose:Intrahepatic recurrence has a significant effect on the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. We aimed to determine if there are useful indicators in predicting the recurrence of liver cancer after a hepatic resection.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 210 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy between January 2009 and December 2015. We examined clinic-pathological variables comparing 2 groups of HCC patients, either intrahepatic recurrence or not.Results:We divided 184 patients into 2 groups; 94 patients (51.1%) with intrahepatic recurrence and 90 patients (48.9%) without intrahepatic recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed operation type, preoperative α-FP, postoperative protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) elevation, and multiple tumor number were closely associated with intrahepatic recurrence. The preoperative PIVKA-II level was not statistically significant in postoperative intrahepatic recurrence rate. The recurrence rate was 46.2% in 132 of 184 cases of α-FP 200 ng/mL was 38 of 184 cases, 21 of which recurred (55.3%). According to the multivariate analysis, OR ratio was 8.003 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.549-41.353) in the α-FP 100-200 ng/mL group and 1.867 (95% CI, 0.784-4.444) in α-FP 200 ng/mL or higher group (P = 0.013). Three-year survival rate of intrahepatic recurrence patients was 80.7%, 3-year survival rate of no intrahepatic recurrence patients was 95.0%.Conclusion:The intrahepatic recurrence rates were high in the group preop α-FP over 100 ng/mL. Close observation is needed. Prospective study for α-FP genes of HCC patients should be planned for predicting intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy.
