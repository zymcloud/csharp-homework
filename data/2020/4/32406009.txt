Background:Eppikajututo (TJ-28, a Kampo medicine) is effective against rheumatoid arthritis and eczema. We conducted a randomized comparative trial to assess the efficacy of TJ-28 for preventing hand-foot syndrome (HFS) as a complication of adjuvant chemotherapy using capecitabine.Methods:The present study was a multi-institutional randomized-controlled trial (UMIN000005899). Colorectal cancer patients scheduled to receive capecitabine chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy were randomly assigned to receive TJ-28 (7500 mg/day) or oral pyridoxine (60 mg/day). Patients were monitored for the development of grade ≥ 2 HFS according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria until chemotherapy completion.Results:Twenty-two patients were enrolled in this study. The relative dose intensity of capecitabine was 76.2% in the TJ-28 group and 68.2% in the pyridoxine group. Grade ≥ 2 HFS developed in 6 (50.0%) of 12 TJ-28 patients and in 4 (40.0%) of 10 pyridoxine patients. Chemotherapy treatment failure was observed in seven patients, mainly due to HFS, liver dysfunction, diarrhea, and neutropenia. Chemotherapy treatment failure due to HFS occurred in none of the TJ-28 group and 2 patients (20.0%) in the pyridoxine group (p = 0.114).Conclusion:Capecitabine-associated HFS was not markedly prevented by TJ-28 compared with pyridoxine. However, TJ-28 might support the continuation of chemotherapy with capecitabine. Further studies are warranted to clarify the benefits of TJ-28.
