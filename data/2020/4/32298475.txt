Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) coactivator-1α (PGC1α) is a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. PGC1α is involved in the carcinogenesis, progression, and metabolic state of cancer. However, its role in progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In this study, we observed that PGC1α was downregulated in human HCC. A clinical study showed that the low levels of PGC1α expression were correlated with poor survival, vascular invasion, and larger tumor size. PGC1α inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro experiment and in vivo mouse model. Mechanistically, PGC1α suppressed Warburg effect through the downregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (PDK1) mediated by WNT/β-catenin pathway, and the inhibition of WNT/β-catenin pathway was induced by the activation of PPARγ. Conclusion: Low levels of PGC1α expression indicate a poor prognosis for HCC patients. PGC1α suppresses HCC metastasis by inhibiting aerobic glycolysis through regulating WNT/β-catenin/PDK1 axis, which depends on PPARγ. PGC1α is a potential factor for predicting prognosis and therapeutic target for HCC patients.
