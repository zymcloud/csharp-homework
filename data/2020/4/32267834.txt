BACKGROUND We explored the role of MACC1-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIAL AND METHODS Measurement of preoperative plasma levels of MACC1-AS1 was performed by qPCR, and the comparison between the HCC and Control group was performed by unpaired t test. The overexpression of TGF-ß1 in SNU-182 and SNU-398 cells was confirmed by qPCR. RESULTS MACC1-AS1 was overexpressed in HCC patients. In comparison to pretreatment level, distant recurrence (DR) was accompanied by increased levels of MACC1-AS1 in plasma, but this phenomenon was not observed in cases of local recurrence (LR) or non-recurrence (NR). In HCC cells, MACC1-AS1 positively regulated the expression of TGF-ß1. MACC1-AS1 overexpression resulted in increased invasion and migration rates of HCC cells, while siRNA silencing resulted in reduced rates. Moreover, TGF-ß1 overexpression reduced the effects of MACC1-AS1 siRNA silencing. CONCLUSIONS MACC1-AS1 is involved in the distant recurrence of HCC, and its actions are possibly mediated by TGF-ß1.
