Background:The Fontan procedure has become the standard operation for patients with single ventricle physiology. Due to cardiac hypokinesis and high central venous pressure, laparoscopic approach, especially in hepatectomy, was considered as controversial after the Fontan procedure. We presented a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that was successfully treated by pure laparoscopic hepatectomy with stable pneumoperitoneum after the Fontan procedure.Case presentation:An 18-year-old man was referred to our hospital for examination of a hepatic tumor. The patient underwent the Fontan procedure for single ventricle physiology at 6 years of age. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypovascular mass in segment 2 and a hypervascular mass in segment 4 of the arterial phase, followed by a delayed washout. CT arteriography revealed that both masses showed hypervascular tumors, and CT during arterial portography showed that both were low-density masses. The patient's general condition was good, and cardiac and respiratory functions were well maintained. Pure laparoscopic hepatectomy was safely performed by keeping the pneumoteritoneum pressure under 6-8 mmHg and monitoring central venous pressure (11-21 mmHg) and end-tidal carbon dioxide. The Pringle maneuver was applied during hepatic resection. The non-anatomical resections were completed without intraoperative complications. The patient was discharged on the 9th postoperative day without postoperative complications.Conclusions:Our report suggests that treatment of HCC by pure laparoscopic hepatectomy after Fontan circulation can be safely performed in patients under sufficient circulatory management.
