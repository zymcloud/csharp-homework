Background:Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is involved in reverse cholesterol transport as a major component of HDL, but also conveys anti-thrombotic, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that are pertinent to its protective roles in cardiovascular, inflammatory and malignant pathologies. Despite the pleiotropy in ApoA-I functions, the regulation of intracellular ApoA-I levels remains poorly explored.Methods:HepG2 hepatoma cells and primary mouse hepatocytes were used as in vitro models to study the impact of genetic and chemical inhibitors of autophagy and the proteasome on ApoA-I by immunoblot, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Different growth conditions were implemented in conjunction with mTORC inhibitors to model the influence of nutrient scarcity versus sufficiency on ApoA-I regulation. Hepatic ApoA-I expression was also evaluated in high fat diet-fed mice displaying blockade in autophagy.Results:Under nutrient-rich conditions, basal ApoA-I levels in liver cells are sustained by the balancing act of autophagy and of mTORC1-dependent de novo protein synthesis. ApoA-I proteolysis occurs through a canonical autophagic pathway involving Beclin1 and ULK1 and the receptor protein p62/SQSTM1 that targets ApoA-I to autophagosomes. However, upon aminoacid insufficiency, suppression of ApoA-I synthesis prevails, rendering mTORC1 inactivation dispensable for autophagy-mediated ApoA-I proteolysis.Conclusion:These data underscore the major contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms to ApoA-I levels which differentially involve mTORC1-dependent signaling to protein synthesis and autophagy, depending on nutrient availability. Given the established role of ApoA-I in HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport, this mode of ApoA-I regulation may reflect a hepatocellular response to the organismal requirement for maintenance of cholesterol and lipid reserves under conditions of nutrient scarcity.
