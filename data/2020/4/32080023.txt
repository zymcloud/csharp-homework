Background:Laparoscopic hepatectomy has been accepted widely due to its advantages as a minimally invasive surgery, but laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomy (LRPS) has rarely been reported. We aimed to explore the safety and feasibility of LRPS by comparing it with open surgical approaches.Materials and methods:Between January 2014 and July 2019, 51 patients who underwent right posterior sectionectomy were enrolled in this study. The patients' characteristics, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes were compared between 2 groups.Results:There were no statistically significant differences in the preoperative data. LRPS showed significantly less blood loss (P=0.001) and shorter hospital stay (P=0.002) than open right posterior sectionectomy, but hospital expenses (P=0.382), operative time (P=0.196), surgical margin (P=0.311), the rate of other complications, and the postoperative white blood cell count, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin showed no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups (P>0.05). For hepatocellular carcinoma, the results showed there were no differences in both disease-free survival (P=0.220) and overall survival (P=0.417) between the 2 groups.Conclusions:Our research suggests that LRPS is a safe and feasible surgical procedure that is efficient from an oncological point of view. It may be the preferred choice for lesions in the right posterior hepatic lobe.
