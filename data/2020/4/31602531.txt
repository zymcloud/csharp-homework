Purpose:There are many treatment choices for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of which is proton beam therapy (PBT). The purpose of this study was to compare surgical resection (SR) and PBT to clarify the prognostic factors for operable HCC based on a single institution's database.Methods:Patients with single primary nodular HCC â‰¤ 100 mm without vessel invasion on pretreatment imaging were divided into the SR group and PBT group. In the PBT group, the patients with unresectable HCC due to their liver function and/or performance status were excluded.Results:There were 314 and 31 patients who underwent SR and PBT, respectively. The median survival time in the SR group was significantly better than in the PBT group (104.1 vs. 64.6 months, p = 0.008). Regarding the relapse-free survival (RFS), there was no significant difference between the SR and PBT groups (33.8 vs. 14.0 months, p = 0.099).Conclusion:The RFS was comparable between the PBT and SR groups. However, the PBT group had a significantly worse overall survival than the SR group. SR may therefore be favorable as an initial treatment for HCC compared to PBT.
