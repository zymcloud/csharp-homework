Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and fatal cancer. People with HCC report higher odds of comorbidity compared with people without HCC. To explore the association between HCC and medical comorbidity, we used routinely collected clinical data and applied a network perspective. In the network perspective, we used correlation analysis and community detection tests that described direct relationships among comorbidities. We collected 14,891 patients with HCC living in Jilin Province, China, between 2016 and 2018. Cirrhosis was the most common comorbidity of HCC. Hypertension and renal cysts were more common in male patients, while chronic viral hepatitis C, hypersplenism, hypoproteinemia, anemia and coronary heart disease were more common in female patients. The proportion of chronic diseases in comorbidities increased with age. The main comorbidity patterns of HCC were: HCC, cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis B, portal hypertension, ascites and other common complications of cirrhosis; HCC, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease and cerebral infarction; and HCC, hypoproteinemia, electrolyte disorders, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hemorrhagic anemia. Our findings provide comprehensive information on comorbidity patterns of HCC, which may be used for the prevention and management of liver cancer.
