Complement factor H-related 3 (CFHR3) is a protein-coding gene acting in various diseases. However, its prognostic values of CFHR3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not understandable. Therefore, we present a further study on CFHR3 in HCC. CFHR3 expression data were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). We compared the differential expression of CFHR3 between the low-stage (stage I and II) and high-stage (stage III and IV) patients with HCC in the TCGA and ICGC cohorts. Furthermore, we assessed the CFHR3 expression as a prognostic marker using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariate, and multivariate analysis. The Kaplan-Meier analysis declared that CFHR3 overexpression was correlated with a good prognosis for HCC patients. Multivariate analysis proved the prognostic significance of CFHR3 expression levels (P
