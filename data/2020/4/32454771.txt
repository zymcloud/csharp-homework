Objectives:The present study revealed the presence of bioactive constituents in Hyrtios aff. erectus sponge (HES) extract collected from the Red Sea using skin and scuba diving.Materials and methods:Cytotoxicity was tested against hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines as a prescreening test.Results:The HES extract had high contents of total phenolic compounds (0.061 mg/g), flavonoids (0.2839 mg/g), and carotenoids (1.976 mg/g). Moreover, the HES extract showed high antioxidant capacity with 93.0% and 99% at 1 mg using 2.2'-Diphenyl-α-picrylhydrazyl and 2.2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), respectively. Cytotoxic activity against cancerous cell lines showed that the HES extract could inhibit cell growth effectively with IC50=47.5 μg/mL. Furthermore, anticancer activity using protein tyrosine kinase and sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitor screening assays resulted in 71.66% and 85.21% inhibition activity, respectively. The anti-inflammatory assays showed that the inhibition activity against cyclooxygenase (COX1), COX2, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α was 71.82%, 81.13%, 80.89%, and 59.74%, respectively. At the same time, the anti-Alzheimer results using acetylcholine inhibition assay showed high activity at 1 mg with 83.51%. Additionally, the antiviral activity using the reverse transcriptase inhibition assay was 91.70%.Conclusion:This marine sponge isolated from the Red Sea showed tremendous activity against many diseases and it is considered an excellent source for bioactive pharmaceutical compounds.
