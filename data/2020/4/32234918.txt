Background:Primary hepatic carcinosarcoma is a rare subtype of liver malignancy, with only a small number of cases described in the English literature.Case report:We report the case of a 72-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C, who presented with complaints of abdominal pain. The patient's alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level was highly elevated at 7,406 ng/ml. His albumin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels were within normal ranges. Computer tomographic scans discovered a 12×9×8 cm mass in the left lobe of the liver, extending to the anterior gastric wall. A partial hepatectomy of segments 2 and 3 with en bloc distal gastrectomy and omentectomy, a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy, and a cholecystectomy were performed. Pathology revealed the mass to be a hepatic carcinosarcoma composed of collision tumor of four malignant components: hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. One and half month post-surgery, the patient was found to have a mass confirmed by biopsy as hepatocellular carcinoma in the right lobe, nodules in his lung and bone, and his AFP level elevated to 51,027.6 ng/ml. He died after two months during hospice care.Conclusion:To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of primary hepatic carcinosarcoma with collision tumor of four malignant entities (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma). The pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of this disease are discussed.
