Background/aims:Non-alcoholic liver disease and alcoholic liver disease begin as simple steatosis that may progress to steatohepatitis and ensuing liver-related complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We explored differences in characteristics between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcoholic steatohepatitis-related (ASH) HCC.Methods:NASH and ASH patients were identified from our department's prospective HCC database. A total of 54 and 45 patients met predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria for the NASH-HCC and ASH-HCC groups, respectively. Clinical, biochemical and tumor characteristics were studied.Results:NASH-HCC patients were older compared to ASH-HCC patients (72±9 vs. 66±9 years, PConclusion:Despite significant differences in demography of the NASH-HCC and ASH-HCC groups, liver and tumor characteristics were comparable. Most patients were diagnosed late and were not amenable to curative or locoregional therapies. Better characterization of patients with NASH and ASH at risk of HCC is necessary to optimize screening, surveillance, and management strategies.
