Importance:One factor associated with the rapidly increasing clinical and economic burden of chronic liver disease (CLD) is inpatient health care utilization.Objective:To understand trends in the hospitalization burden of CLD in the US.Design, setting, and participants:This cross-sectional study of hospitalized adults in the US used data from the National Inpatient Sample from 2012 to 2016 on adult CLD-related hospitalizations. Data were analyzed from June to October 2019.Main outcomes and measures:Hospitalizations identified using a comprehensive review of CLD-specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Survey-weighted annual trends in national estimates of CLD-related hospitalizations, in-hospital mortality, and hospitalization costs, stratified by demographic and clinical characteristics.Results:This study included 1 016 743 CLD-related hospitalizations (mean [SD] patient age, 57.4 [14.4] years; 582 197 [57.3%] male; 633 082 [62.3%] white). From 2012 to 2016, the rate of CLD-related hospitalizations per 100 000 hospitalizations increased from 3056 (95% CI, 3042-3069) to 3757 (95% CI, 3742-3772), and total inpatient hospitalization costs increased from $14.9 billion (95% CI, $13.9 billion to $15.9 billion) to $18.8 billion (95% CI, $17.6 billion to $20.0 billion). Mean (SD) patient age increased (56.8 [14.2] years in 2012 to 57.8 [14.6] years in 2016) and, subsequently, the proportion with Medicare also increased (41.7% [95% CI, 41.1%-42.2%] to 43.6% [95% CI, 43.1%-44.1%]) (P for trend Conclusions and relevance:Over the study period, the total estimated national hospitalization costs in patients with CLD reached $81.1 billion. The inpatient CLD burden in the US is likely increasing because of an aging CLD population with increases in concomitant comorbid conditions.
