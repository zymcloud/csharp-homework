Background and aim:It has been suggested that tumor markers can provide additional information over tumor size and number-based liver transplantation (LT) criteria. We aimed to assess if changes in tumor markers are associated with the risk of tumor recurrence after LT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who received loco-regional therapies (LRTs).Methods:A total of 129 patients who received LT with pre-LT LRTs for HCC were analyzed. Milan criteria and tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein, and protein induced by vitamin K antagonist II, at diagnosis and at transplant were assessed. The primary outcome was tumor recurrence.Results:When patients were stratified by radiologic criteria, cumulative recurrence rates at 3 years for patients who were not down-staged (outside Milan to outside Milan), progressed (within Milan to outside Milan), down-staged (outside Milan to within Milan), and bridged (within Milan to within Milan) were 66.7%, 58.3%, 18.7%, and 8.5%, respectively (P Conclusions:Changes of tumor markers can provide additional information on the risk of recurrence after LT among HCC patients who received LRTs, indicating that they could be used to refine current LT selection criteria.
