Objective:This study retrospectively reviewed the recurrence rate and survival time of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after treatment with Erzhu Qinggan Jiedu Recipe (ESQJR), explored the impact of Chinese medicine in reducing tumor recurrence and prolonging survival time, and explored an effective prevention treatment for the recurrence of HCC.Methods:A total of 137 patients who underwent HCC resection from May 2004 to January 2018 were included in this retrospective study. The patients were divided into two groups, with 68 patients in the Western medicine group and 69 patients in the Western medicine plus ESQJR group. The relapse rate, overall survival period, and disease-free survival period before and after treatment were analyzed. Indices including alpha-fetoprotein, ALT, AST, and KPS score were obtained for analysis and comparison.Results:There was no significant difference among patient clinical parameters between the two groups. Compared with the Western medicine group, the Western medicine plus ESQJR group had a reduced cumulative recurrence rate, prolonged overall survival time and disease-free survival time, and improved clinical symptoms, including quality of life and liver function.Conclusion:ESQJR effectively improved of long-term survival in resected HCC patients. ESQJR has the potential to be used as an adjuvant therapy with significant beneficial effects for treating HCC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
