Objective:To investigate the prognostic value of change in liver stiffness following surgery, in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients with HBV-related HCC were included. Preoperative (baseline) liver stiffness and postoperative dynamic change in liver stiffness was evaluated.Results:Out of 158 patients in total, postoperative liver stiffness was increased in 98 patients and decreased in 60 patients compared with baseline values. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with elevated liver stiffness had significantly worse overall survival outcomes than those with decreased liver stiffness. Similar trends were observed for diseases-free survival and recurrence outcomes. Multivariate analyses showed that Child–Turcotte–Pugh score (hazard ratio [HR] 1.209) and liver stiffness changes (HR 1.891) were independent factors associated with overall survival. Liver stiffness changes (HR 1.521) and α-fetoprotein level (HR 1.210) were found to be independent factors for disease-free survival in patients with HCC.Conclusion:Increased postoperative liver stiffness may be an independent risk factor of HCC prognosis. Patients with increased liver stiffness following surgery should undergo additional examinations during follow-up.
