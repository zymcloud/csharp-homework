Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death in the world. Choline deficiency has been well studied in the context of liver disease; however, less is known about the effects of choline supplementation in HCC.Objective:The objective of this study was to test whether choline supplementation could influence the progression of HCC in a high-fat-diet (HFD)-driven mouse model.Methods:Four-day-old male C57BL/6J mice were treated with the chemical carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, and were randomly assigned at weaning to a cohort fed an HFD (60% kcal fat) or an HFD with supplemental choline (60% kcal fat, 1.2% choline; HFD+C) for 30 wk. Blood was isolated at 15 and 30 wk to measure immune cells by flow cytometry, and glucose-tolerance tests were performed 2 wk prior to killing. Overall tumor burden was quantified, hepatic lipids were measured enzymatically, and phosphatidylcholine species were measured by targeted MS methods. Gene expression and mitochondrial DNA were quantified by quantitative PCR.Results:HFD+C mice exhibited a 50-90% increase in both circulating choline and betaine concentrations in the fed state (P ≤ 0.05). Choline supplementation resulted in a 55% decrease in total tumor numbers, a 67% decrease in tumor surface area, and a 50% decrease in hepatic steatosis after 30 wk of diet (P ≤ 0.05). Choline supplementation increased the abundance of mitochondria and the relative expression of β-oxidation genes by 21% and ∼75-100%, respectively, in the liver. HFD+C attenuated circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells at 15 wk of feeding (P ≤ 0.05).Conclusions:Choline supplementation attenuated HFD-induced HCC and hepatic steatosis in male C57BL/6J mice. These results suggest a therapeutic benefit of choline supplementation in blunting HCC progression.
