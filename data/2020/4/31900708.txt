Objectives:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 10-year overall survival and local tumor progression (LTP) of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for single nodular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Methods:A total of 467 newly diagnosed patients with single nodular HCC Results:The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates after RFA were 83.7% and 74.2%, respectively. LTP (hazard ratio (HR), 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-3.47) was one of the important factors for overall survival after RFA. The 5- and 10-year LTP rates after RFA were 20.4% and 25.1%, respectively. Periportal location (subdistribution HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.25-4.21), subphrenic location (2.25, 1.34-3.86), size ≥ 1.5-Conclusion:Ten-year therapeutic outcomes of percutaneous RFA as first-line therapy were excellent for single HCC Key points:• Updated 10-year survival outcome of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation as first-line therapy for single hepatocellular carcinoma
