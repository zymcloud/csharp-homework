Background:The Albumin-Bilirubin score (ALBI) has been established to predict outcomes after hepatectomy. However, the relative value of ALBI and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) in predicting post-hepatectomy liver failure and mortality has not been adequately evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to validate and compare ALBI and MELD with respect to post-hepatectomy liver failure and mortality.Study design:Patients undergoing major hepatectomy (≥3 segments) or partial hepatectomy (≤2 segments) were identified in the 2014 to 2017 American College of Surgeons NSQIP Procedure Targeted Participant Use File. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed for 30-day post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) and mortality. Predictive accuracy was assessed using a receiver operator characteristic curve and calculating the area under the curve (AUC).Results:For 13,783 patients, median ALBI was -2.6, and median MELD score was 6.9. Severe PHLF (grade B to C) and mortality rates were 2.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Multivariable analyses revealed ALBI grade 2/3 to be a stronger predictor than MELD ≥10 with respect to severe PHLF (odds ratio [OR] 2.30; 95% CI, 1.95 to 2.73; p Conclusions:ALBI is a powerful predictor of PHLF and mortality. Compared with MELD, ALBI is more accurate, especially in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
