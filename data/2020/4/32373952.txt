Objective:To investigate the role of human serum albumin (hsa)_circular (circ)_0000711 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Circular ribonucleic acids (circRNAs) are proven in numerous studies to play crucial role in tumor biology, but their roles in HCC remain unknown to a great extent.Patients and methods:The circRNA expression profile microarray was employed to screen differentially expressed circRNAs in tumor tissues and adjacent tissues from HCC patients, and Reverse Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) assay was performed for further verification. Next, the target micro RNAs (miRNAs) and their messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of key circRNAs were predicted by bioinformatics software, and a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed. Subsequently, KEGG and GO enrichment analyses were applied to predict the possible biological processes regulated by hsa_circ_0000711 and relevant signaling pathways. The miRNAs playing a key role in the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network were then selected as the objects, and their direct binding to hsa_circ_0000711 was confirmed via luciferase reporter gene assay. Thereafter, hsa_circ_0000711 was overexpressed or knocked out, and the biological function of hsa_circ_0000711 was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, apoptosis detection, and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining assay in vitro.Results:The results of expression profile screening revealed that there was a significant difference in the expression profile of circRNAs between tumor tissues and adjacent tissues in HCC patients. Based on the circRNA expression profile and RT-qPCR results, the expression level of hsa_circ_0000711 was overtly reduced in HCC tissues. In addition, miR-103a-3p had the highest eigenvector centrality in the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network, suggesting that miR-103a-3p is a vital participant in the pathological mechanism of hsa_circ_0000711. The KEGG enrichment analysis results pointed out that the target genes regulated by hsa_circ_0000711 were clearly enriched in the tumor-associated signaling pathways. Besides, the results of GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes regulated by hsa_circ_0000711 were mainly related to cell cycle regulation, so cell proliferation might be affected. The results of luciferase reporter gene and RT-qPCR assays showed that hsa_circ_0000711 directly bound to has-miR-103a-3p to serve as a molecular sponge. The results of CCK-8 and EdU staining assays revealed that the proliferation of hepatoma cells in hsa_circ_0000711 overexpression group was evidently enhanced. In addition, it was further found via flow cytometry that the apoptosis rate of cells was significantly raised in hsa_circ_0000711 low-expression group and dramatically declined in hsa_circ_0000711 overexpression group.Conclusions:Overexpression of hsa_circ_0000711 promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of hepatoma cells via targeting has-miR-103a-3p.
