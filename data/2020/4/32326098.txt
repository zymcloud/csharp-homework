Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important contributors to the biological processes underlying the pathophysiology of various human diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the involvement of these molecules in chronic liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and viral hepatitis, has only recently been considered in scientific research. While extensive studies on the pathogenesis of the development of HCC from hepatic fibrosis have been conducted, their regulatory molecular mechanisms are still only partially understood. The underlying mechanisms related to lncRNAs leading to HCC from chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis have not yet been entirely elucidated. Therefore, elucidating the functional roles of lncRNAs in chronic liver disease and HCC can contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms, and may help in developing novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC, as well as in preventing the progression of chronic liver disease to HCC. Here, we comprehensively review and briefly summarize some lncRNAs that participate in both hepatic fibrosis and HCC.
