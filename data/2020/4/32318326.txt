Liver cancer is thought as the most common human malignancy worldwide, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for nearly 90% liver cancer. Due to its poor early diagnosis and limited treatment, HCC has therefore become the most lethal malignant cancers in the world. Recently, molecular targeted therapies showed great promise in the treatment of HCC, and novel molecular therapeutic targets is urgently needed. KIF15 is a microtubule-dependent motor protein involved in multiple cell processes, such as cell division. Additionally, KIF15 has been reported to participate in the growth of various types of tumors; however, the relation between KIF15 and HCC is unclear. Herein, our study investigated the possible role of KIF15 on the progression of HCC and found that KIF15 has high expression in tumor samples from HCC patients. KIF15 could play a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation of HCC, which was proved by in vitro and in vivo assays. In conclusion, this study confirmed that KIF15 could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
