Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play vital roles in tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there remains a lack of high-throughput studies on gene expression alterations in HCC cells in response to direct interactions with HSCs. In this study, we established a direct co-culture model of HSCs and HCC cells. We found that the expression of a set of miRNAs, most notably miR-1246, was triggered by HSCs. RORα was confirmed as the target gene of miR-1246. Either overexpression of miR-1246 or knockdown of RORα enhanced the proliferation, invasiveness, and metastatic capability of HCC both in vitro and in vivo, through Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation and promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, upregulation of miR-1246 and repression of RORα were prominent features of aggressive clinical HCC. The miR-1246-RORα-Wnt/β-catenin axis is a novel pathway through which HSCs accelerate HCC progression.
