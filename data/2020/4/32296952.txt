Purpose of review:We review advances in imaging of liver tumors, by particularly focusing on the utility of novel imaging in diagnosis and management of these lesions.Recent findings:Contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI are currently utilized for accurate diagnosis of liver tumors, but several ongoing studies are examining the use of other advanced techniques. Novel CT (i.e., dual-energy CT and perfusion CT), MRI (diffusion-weighted imaging, MR elastography, and T1 mapping), and image processing (texture analysis and artificial intelligence-based methods) techniques have emerged and can be used for precise characterization of liver tumors, quantification of treatment responses, and prediction of overall survival rate of patients. Recent advancements in imaging of liver tumors allowed for a precise assessment of tumor features. These evolving technologies can be utilized for applying individualized treatment based on the presence of specific imaging biomarkers.
