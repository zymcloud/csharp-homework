Previous studies have shown that crude polysaccharides from the Lycium barbarum fruit could inhibit cancer cell growth, but the major effective constituents are yet to be identified. In this study, we compared the effects of L. barbarum fruit polysaccharide fractions on the growth of hepatoma cells (SMMC-7721 and HepG2), cervical cancer cells (HeLa), gastric carcinoma cells (SGC-7901), and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). LBGP-I-3 showed stronger inhibitory effects on MCF-7 cells (cell viability of 48.96%) than SMMC-7721 (cell viability of 78.91%) and HeLa cells (cell viability of 55.94%), and had no effect on HepG2 and SGC-7901 cells. In addition, LBGP-I-3 had no inhibitory effect on normal liver cells (L02, cell viability of 115.58%). Investigation of the underlying mechanism suggested that LBGP-I-3 inhibited the growth of cancer cells by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. LBGP-I-3 arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, altered mitochondrial function, activated oxidative stress, and regulated the MAPK signaling pathway to induce apoptosis. Thus, LBGP-I-3 may be a potential functional food ingredient for the prevention of cancer without toxicity to normal cells in vitro. These results could help further elucidate the structure-activity relationship of L. barbarum fruit polysaccharides and functional food development.
