Background:"Unification of medicines and excipients" is the special principle which means fatty oil with pharmacodynamic activity derived from traditional Chinese medicine are taken as liquid lipids in perparation for dual-drug delivery, which improve the treatment effect and reduce unnecessary excipients.Purpose:The aim of this study was to prepare a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) with naringin (NG) containing coix seed oil (CSO) as liquid lipid based on the theory (NCNLC) in order to achieve synergistic antitumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We developed NCNLCs using ultrasonic melt-emulsification method. The antitumor effect in vivo/in vitro and drug release ability were compared to NLC prepared with conventional liquid lipids: neodecanoate triglycerides (NDNLC) and oleic acid (NONLC).Results:Transmission electron microscopy showed that NCNLCs had a well-defined spherical shape, small size, and narrow polydispersity index. Importantly, the release of drugs from NDNLCs and NONLCs was slower than NCNLCs. In the cell study, the result showed a significantly greater antiproliferative effect towards HepG2 cells, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of NCNLCs was 3.24-fold, 1.70-fold and 1.52-fold lower to that of free drug, NDNLCs and NONLCs, respectively. Moreover, NCNLCs significantly induced HepG2 cells apoptosis by being 2.12-fold and 9.28-fold higher to that of NDNLCs and NONLCs, respectively. In the study of antitumor efficacy in vivo, the synergistic effect of NCNLCs formulation showed markedly enhanced antitumor efficacy in a xenograft model of liver cancer.Conclusion:The advantages of "unification of medicines and excipients" in formulation characters, drug release and synergistic antitumor effect provide a new idea for the application of the fatty oil of traditional Chinese medicine in the nano-drug delivery for cancer therapy.
