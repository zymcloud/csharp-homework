Introduction:This study investigated demographic characteristics and the prevalence of viremia among anti-HCV-positive patients.Methodology:Hospital records of adult patients with anti-HCV positivity between June 2016 and October 2018 were screened retrospectively. Demographic characteristics, genotype distribution, history of injection drug use (IDU), treatment data of HCV RNA-positive patients were investigated.Results:The rate of anti-HCV seropositivity was 1.7% and 54.5% of these were viremic. 69.5% of the 869 viremic patients were male. The mean age was 62 ± 15 (18-95) years for women and 42 ± 19 (18-90) years for men (p 40 did not receive treatment (p Conclusions:A shift in the demographic structure of HCV-infected patients due to the changing trends of the HCV transmission mode was observed in this study. On the other hand, the proportion of patients who received DAA therapy was low. A substantial proportion of untreated patients were young with a history of IDU. This indicates that without strategies targeting the patients, the patient load due to HCV-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma may persist in the future.
