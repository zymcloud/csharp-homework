Here, a formulation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and two natural polymers such as alginate (ALG) and nanocrystalline cellulose (CNC) was developed for the 3D printing of scaffolds with large surface area, improved mechanical resistance and sustained capabilities to promote antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects. Mechanical resistance, water content, morphological characterization and silver distribution of the scaffolds were provided. As for applications, a comparable antimicrobial potency against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa was demonstrated by in vitro tests as function of the AgNP concentration in the scaffold (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration value: 10 mg/mL). By reusing the 3D system the antimicrobial efficacy was demonstrated over at least three applications. The cytotoxicity effects caused by administration of AgNPs to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell culture through ALG and ALG/CNC scaffold were discussed as a function of time and dose. Finally, the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technique was used for targeted analysis of pro-apoptotic initiation and executioner caspases, anti-apoptotic and proliferative proteins and the hepatocyte growth factor, and provided insights about molecular mechanisms involved in cell death induction.
