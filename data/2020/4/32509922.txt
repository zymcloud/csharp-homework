The burden of hepatitis C virus infection remains very high despite huge progress in the cure of the infection. The high prevalence of hepatitis C, especially in vulnerable groups and particularly drug users, may compromise the achievement of the 2030 WHO targets with a 90% reduction in new infections and a 65% reduction in mortality. Therapy with the latest pangenotypic direct-acting antivirals provides cure rates in the order of 97% with short-term oral treatment (8-12 weeks) and with an excellent safety and tolerability profile. Curing the infection causes significant health gains derived from preventing complications from cirrhosis, especially hepatocellular carcinoma, and from liver transplantation. Elimination of hepatitis seems feasible with the implementation of a massive therapy program, focusing particularly on vulnerable populations, through micro-elimination strategies, and in the general population with age-based screening. The reduction of the virus reservoir (humans are the only reservoir) is a determining factor in eradicating the virus.
