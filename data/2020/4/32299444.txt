Background:MiRNAs are a group of multifunctional non-coding RNAs which play an important role in the various physiological processes including the development of NAFLD. Recent studies have shown that miR-30b-5p tightly associated with the abnormal lipid metabolism in patients with NAFLD, but the detailed mechanism of miR-30b-5p in the lipid metabolism was remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-30b-5p on the lipid metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma Huh-7 cells.Material and methods:The correlation of intracellular fat content with the expression of miR-30b-5p in Huh-7 cells and HepG2 cells was investigated by treated cells with different concentrations of FFAs. The effect of miR-30b-5p on the lipid deposition in Huh-7 cells was tested by oil red O staining and TG concentrations measurement. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to investigate the lipid metabolism-related genes PPAR-α, SREBP-1, and GULT1 in miR-30b-5p overexpressed or inhibited Huh-7 cells. Target genes of miR-30b-5p were predicted using starBase, miRDB, and TargetScan databases and verified by qRT-PCR and western blot.Results:The expression of miR-30b-5p was significant decreased in the FFAs treated Huh-7 cells and HepG2 cells. Overexpressing miR-30b-5p in Huh-7 cells decreased the number and size of lipid droplets and intracellular TG concentrations in Huh-7 cells. Expression of fatty acid oxidation related gene PPAR-α was increased and expression of lipid synthesis related gene SREBP-1 was decreased in the miR-30b-5p overexpressed Huh-7 cells. In addition, miR-30b-5p regulates the intracellular lipid metabolism by targeting PPARGC1A.Conclusions:Overexpression of miR-30b-5p could reduce the intracellular fat deposition in Huh-7 cells, and miR-30b-5p might regulate the intracellular lipid metabolism by targeting the PPARGC1A in Huh-7 cells.
