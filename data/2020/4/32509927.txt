The authors describe a case of a 76-year-old male with a medical history of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) of the right lower eyelid. He was admitted to the emergency department due to abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium, nauseas, asthenia, and choluria with 3 days of evolution. Biochemical liver workup revealed a cytocholestase pattern as well as a prolonged prothrombin time. After admission, the patient developed hepatic encephalopathy, and a clinical and analytical worsening was observed. Abdominal ultrasound showed a reduction in the caliber of the hepatic veins, in apparent relation to a parenchymal compression. Liver biopsy was performed and showed an extensive infiltration of the hepatic parenchyma by a solid neoplasm, which, upon immunohistochemical study, was compatible with a diffuse metastization of a MCC. We report this clinical case due to its rarity of presentation and to show the important role of liver biopsy in cases of acute hepatitis.
