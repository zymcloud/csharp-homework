Purpose:Our purpose was to report outcomes in patients with Child-Pugh B or C (CP B/C) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).Methods and materials:Patients with HCC suitable for SBRT were prospectively enrolled in the study from 2012 to 2018. Outcomes in patients with CP B/C were analyzed. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare survival outcomes between baseline CP score and post-SBRT CP score.Results:Twenty-three patients with CP B/C with a total of 29 HCC tumors were treated with SBRT. Eighty-seven percent of patients were CP B8-C10. Median tumor size was 3.1 cm (range, 1-10 cm). Median dose delivered was 40 Gy in a median of 5 fractions. Eighteen of 23 patients (78.3%) had been previously treated with transarterial chemoembolization. Median follow-up was 14.5 months. Rates of 6- and 12-month local control were 100% and 92.3%, respectively. Six- and 12-month survival rates were 73.9% and 56.5%, respectively. Median survival was 14.5 months overall and 9.2, 22.5, 14.5, and 14.4 months for patients with CP B7, B8, B9, and C10, respectively. No patients exhibited symptoms of classic radiation-induced liver disease. However, 10 patients had CP score progression, with 4 patients (17%) having a â‰¥2-point increase in CP score by 6 months (or time of censor). There were 7 liver-related deaths, and based on independent review by a hepatologist, 1 of these deaths may have been attributable to SBRT-related liver injury. Fifteen of 23 patients were listed for liver transplant (LT) at the time of SBRT and 9 went on to receive LT with a pathologic complete response rate of 63.6%. Median survival, excluding patients who received LT, was 7.3 months.Conclusions:SBRT is a reasonable treatment option for carefully selected patients with CP B7-C10. In our small cohort, there was no detectable difference between local control or overall survival and baseline CP score.
