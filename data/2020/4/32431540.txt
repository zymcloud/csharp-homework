Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most common malignancies. While there is lack of markers capable of predicting which patients are at risk of aggressive course of the disease. Although a few protein phosphatase methyl-esterase-1 (PME-1) tumor-promoting mechanisms have been reported, the role of PME-1 in cancer including HCC occurrence and progression remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the expression pattern and relationship between PME-1 with the pathological parameters in patients with HCC.Methods:PME-1 expression was assessed from HCC tissue chips via immunohistochemistry. Chi-square test was used to identify the association between PME-1 staining and clinicopathological variables of HCC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis ï»¿were performed to draw survival curves and verify the independent prognostic factors of HCC patients, respectively.Results:We found that PME-1 expression was significantly higher in HCC tumor tissues compared with non-tumor tissues (P Conclusion:In conclusion, these findings indicated that PME-1 expression was associated with aggressive pathological features and worse oncological outcomes, suggesting its potential therapeutic value for patients with HCC.
