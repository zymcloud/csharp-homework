All different types of metabolism of tumors are dependent on the flow of water molecules through the biological membrane, where fluid transfer interceded by aquaporins (AQPs) are the basis means for water entrance into the cells or outside them. Aquaporins play other roles including cellular migration, cellular expansion and cellular adhesion facilitation. Therefore, regulators of AQPs may be useful anticancer agents. Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Sciences were searched. From among the papers found, 106 were related to the subject. All of the examined cancers in relation to AQP1 included adenoid cystic carcinoma, bladder, breast, cervical, colon, colorectal, hepatocellular, lung, ovarian, plural mesothelioma, prostate, renal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. All of the studied cancers in relation with AQP3 included gastric, breast, prostate, lung, pancreas, skin, bladder, squamous cell carcinoma, cervical, adenoid cystic carcinoma, colon, colorectal, ovarian, and hepatocellular cancers and with regard to AQP5 were lung, squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian, adenoid cystic carcinoma, breast, colon, colorectal, hepatic, pancreas, gallbladder, prostate, and gastric cancers. Over or under-expression of AQP1, 3 and is exist in the mentioned cancers across different studies. Over-expression of AQP1, AQP3 and AQP5 is clearly associated with carcinogenesis, metastasis, reduced survival rate, lymph node metastasis, poorer prognosis, and cellular migration. Also, cancer treatments in relation to these markers suggest AQP reduction during the treatment.
