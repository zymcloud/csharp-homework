Background:Association between statin use and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. We performed a meta-analysis of follow-up studies to systematically evaluate the influence of statin use on clinical outcome in HCC patients.Methods:Studies were obtained via systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane's Library, and Embase databases. A randomized-effect model was used to pool the results. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of study characteristics on the association.Results:Nine retrospective cohort studies were included. Overall, statin use was associated with a reduced all-cause mortality in HCC patients (risk ratio [RR]: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.88, P 0.05). Moreover, statin use was associated with reduced HCC-related mortality (RR: 0.78, P = 0.001) in overall patient population and HCC recurrence in patients after curative therapies (RR: 0.55, P Conclusions:Satin use is associated with reduced mortality and recurrence of HCC. These results should be validated in prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials.
