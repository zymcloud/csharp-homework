Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal disease, and novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Recently, expression of the C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and its ligands has been found to play an important role in cancer progression and metastasis. In this study, we blocked the CCR5 receptor by the FDA approved antagonist maraviroc (MVC) in Suit2-007 and MIA-PaCa-2 human PDAC cells. The treatment significantly inhibited their proliferation and induced apoptosis of exposed cells as evidenced by caspases activation and increased Bax levels. Moreover, MVC inhibited the cell cycle by down regulating the proteins of the complexes of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 - Cyclin D and CDK2 - Cyclin E, as well as by increasing the protein levels of CDK inhibitors p18, p21 and p27. In line with this, MVC caused significant retardation of Suit2-007 cells growing in a PDAC liver metastasis xenograft model (p < 0.05). These results suggest that maraviroc could be a promising treatment strategy for PDAC patients with liver metastases.
