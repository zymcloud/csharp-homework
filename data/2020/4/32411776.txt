One of the most commonly used systems for grading liver function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is the Child-Pugh (CP) score. However, the CP scoring system is not without its shortcomings: for example, the cut-off values for the parameters are calculated arbitrarily and the assessment of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy is subjective. More recently, an alternative to traditional CP grade has emerged in the form of albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade. The predictive value provided for HCC patients by the ALBI grade is comparable to that of the CP grade; however, it can also surpass CP grade by greatly reducing subjectivity and further subdividing CP A patients into several different groups, thus improving the prognosis judgment and helping to inform clinicians' optimal decision-making. The application of the ALBI grade into currently used HCC staging systems such as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) staging system, and the Japan Integrated Staging (JIS) score, etc., as well as newly produced systems like the ALBI-PLT grade, the ALBI and progression disease (ALBI-PD) grade and Modified Intermediate Stage of Liver Cancer (MICAN) criteria, greatly elevates prognostic power.
