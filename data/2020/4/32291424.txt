Objectives:To investigate the prognostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) plus the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) to predict survival outcomes in huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:There were 180 huge HCC patients undergoing TACE between 2011 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who has an increased NLR (greater than 3.94) and a decreased LMR (â‰¤2.20) were assessed score 2 according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and patients who were assigned with 1, with one of these characteristic or 0 with neither of these characteristics. We used univariate and multivariate analyses for evaluations of the predicative NLR, LMR and other values about overall survival (OS) using multivariate Cox's regression.Results:The liver function index such as aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and total bilirubin, as well as in ammatory biomarkers like absolute neutrophil count, monocyte count, lymphocyte count, seemed much larger than the groups with an NLR-LMR score of 2 than in the other 2 groups (p less than 0.05 for all), including BCLC stage. Higher NLR plus a low level of LMR predicted a short median OS. Multivariate Cox's regression revealed that an NLR-LMR score of 2 was a useful predictor of OS in huge HCC patients after TACE.Conclusion:The pretreatment NLR plus LMR are effective for predicting survival outcomes in huge HCC patients after TACE.
