Background:Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been inconsistently associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. This meta-analysis aimed to synthesize relevant data on SNPs associated with HCC in the Asian population.Methods:Databases were searched to identify association studies of SNPs and HCC in Asians published through January 2019. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on 41 studies (13,167 patients with HCC and 15,886 noncancer controls). Network meta-analysis and Thakkinstian's algorithm were used to select the most appropriate genetic model, along with false positive report probability (FPRP) for noteworthy associations.Results:Eleven SNPs meeting the inclusion criteria were tested for association with HCC, including CCND1 rs9344, PTGS2 rs689466, IL18 rs187238 and rs1946518, KIF1B rs17401966, MDM2 rs2279744, MIR146A rs2910164, MIR149 rs2292832, MIR196A2 rs11614913, MIR499A rs3746444, and TGFB1 rs1800469. A significant increase for HCC risk was observed for MDM2 rs2279744, and the dominant (pooled OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.26-2.00) and codominant (pooled OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.18-1.60) models were determined to be the most appropriate models. MIR499A rs3746444 also showed a significant association with HCC risk under the allele contrast model (pooled OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.05-1.77). Only the significance of MDM2 rs2279744 was noteworthy (FPRP Conclusions:MDM2 rs2279744 is associated with HCC susceptibility in Asians, and the dominant and codominant models are likely the most appropriate models to estimate HCC risk.
