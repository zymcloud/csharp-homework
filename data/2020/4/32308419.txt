MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous non-coding single-stranded small-molecule RNAs that regulate gene expression by repressing target messenger RNA (mRNA) translation or degrading mRNA. miR-34a is one of the most important miRNAs participating in various physiological and pathological processes. miR-34a is abnormally expressed in a variety of tumors. The roles of miR-34a in gastrointestinal cancer (GIC) draw lots of attention. Numerous studies have demonstrated that dysregulated miR-34a is closely related to the proliferation, differentiation, migration, and invasion of tumor cells, as well as the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and chemo-resistance of tumors. Thus, we systematically reviewed the abnormal expression and regulatory roles of miR-34a in GICs including esophageal cancer (EC), gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pancreatic cancer (PC), and gallbladder cancer (GBC). It may provide a profile of versatile roles of miR-34a in GICs.
