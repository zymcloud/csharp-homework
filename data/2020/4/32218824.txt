Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide with a high morbidity and mortality rate. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) serve an important role in HCC. The present study investigated the role of miR-939-3p in HCC. It was demonstrated that miR-939-3p was upregulated in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues compared with normal liver cell lines and paired normal tissues, respectively. It was also found that upregulation of miR-939-3p expression levels in HCC tissues was associated with a less favorable prognosis. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-939-3p in LM3 cells enhanced the metastatic capacity of these cells and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In contrast, miR-939-3p inhibition decreased the invasive capacity of HCC cells and EMT. Potential binding target of miR-939-3p to estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) were predicted using TargetScan. The expression levels of miR-939-3p were negatively associated with ESR1 in HCC tissues based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm ESR1 as a direct downstream target of miR-393-3p. The miR-939-3p/ESR1 axis may be a potential novel target for the treatment of HCC.
