Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), formerly named non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common liver disorder in many countries. The inflammatory subtype termed steatohepatitis is a driver of disease progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, and death, but also to extrahepatic complications including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The plasticity of macrophages in response to various environmental cues and the fact that they can orchestrate cross talk between different cellular players during disease development and progression render them an ideal target for drug development. This report reviews recent advances in our understanding of macrophage biology during the entire spectrum of MAFLD including steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as for the extra-hepatic manifestations of MAFLD. We discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms of macrophage activation and polarization as well as cross talk with other cell types such as hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and adipose tissue. We conclude with a discussion on the potential translational implications and challenges for macrophage based therapeutics for MAFLD.
