Objective:To evaluate the prognosis of women with distant metastasis at the time of endometrial cancer (EC) diagnosis and identify prognostic factors according to metastatic site.Methods:A retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed with EC according to the SEER database between 2010 and 2014. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression was used to identify variables associated with overall survival. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare survival among different groups.Results:Overall, 2948 women with stage IV EC were identified. The most common distant metastatic site was the lung. Having a distant metastatic site independently predicted overall survival. Using brain metastasis as a reference, overall survival was longer for liver (P=0.049), lung (P=0.005), and bone (P=0.019) metastasis. Relative to no distant metastasis, overall survival was shorter for women with one (P<0.001) or two or more (P<0.001) sites of distant metastasis. Overall survival was independently influenced by tumor grade, insurance status, and surgery among women with only lung metastasis.Conclusion:The findings showed that the prognosis of women with stage IV EC differs by distant metastatic site, and identified several predictors of poor survival. They may help clinicians to better predict prognosis for newly diagnosed cases of EC with distant metastasis.
