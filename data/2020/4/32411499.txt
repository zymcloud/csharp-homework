The diagnosis of different types of cancer in a single patient has been appeared in the field in some case reports involving different categories of cancer types either appeared at the same time (synchronous) or subsequently (meta-synchronous). The aim of this report is to present this interesting case of male patient who was under treatment of CML then T-lymphoblastic lymphoma and HCC discovered subsequently. CML, Lymphoma and HCC are arising from different lines of cells with different biology and cytogenetic criteria. CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia may occur together in cases of blastic crisis of CML. But, they rarely occur together as separate multiple malignancies especially without any history of exposure to ionizing radiation, chemotherapy or transplantation.
Chronic myeloid leukemia; T-lymphoblastic lymphoma; hepatitis C virus; hepatocellular carcinoma; tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
