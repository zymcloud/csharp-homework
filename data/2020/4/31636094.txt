The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 71.1 million persons and causes 400,000 deaths annually worldwide. HCV mostly infects the liver, causing acute and chronic necroinflammatory damage, which may progress toward cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, HCV has been associated with several extrahepatic manifestations. The advent of safe and effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has made the dream of eliminating this public health scourge feasible in the medium term. Prospective studies using DAA-based regimens have shown the benefit of HCV clearance in terms of both liver- and non-liver-related mortality.
