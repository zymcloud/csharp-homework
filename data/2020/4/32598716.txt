Aim:To study liver function and portal hypertension, incidence and risk factors of liver-related complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) after direct-acting antiviral therapy.Materials and methods:Patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis were followed up after achievement SVR with assessment of liver function parameters, portal hypertension, Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Сhild Pugh (CP) scores, complications development, including HCC, every 36 months. The median follow-up duration was 24 [18; 30] months after end of treatment.Results:At last observation, a number of cirrhotic patients with CP class A increased from 72% to 85%, with CP class B reduced from 23.5% to 12.5%, with CP class C from 4.5% to 2.5%. In 89% patients were identified a regress of liver fibrosis (from 23.5 [16.9; 28] to 15.0 [10.2; 21.3] kPa,p0.005), each third patient reduction of fibrosis stage to F2/F3. In 19 (9.5%) patients were occurred liver-related complications, including HCC (in 9 patients). Baseline high total bilirubin level (34 mol/l) (Hazard ratio (HR) 11.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.357.8,р0.005) and ascites (HR=17.6, 95% CI 2.1144.8,p=0.008) were independent risk factors associated with HCC development.Conclusion:The risk of HCC development remains in patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis, despite on eradication of hepatitis C virus. Therefore, these patients should continue to undergo more intensive examination (ultrasound examination and determination of alfa-fetoprotein level each 36 months), including contrast-enhanced methods of imaging, the frequency of which should be determined.
