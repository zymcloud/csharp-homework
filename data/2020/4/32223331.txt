Non-invasive fibrosis indices, according to regular laboratory and clinical data, could be useful in assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis patients. However, the role of these biomarkers remains unclear in predicting the outcome of HBV-associated HCC in patients. This study was carried out retrospectively and included a relatively large sample size (n = 405) with a heterogeneous population of HBV infected patients and longer duration of prospective follow-up. Our study suggested that APRI and Fibro-α Scores are inversely correlated with overall survival in HBV-associated HCC patients. Meanwhile, GUCI, King Score, and APRI were highly correlated with cirrhosis status. Also, in subgroups of cirrhosis or non-cirrhosis, Fibro-α Scores could differentiate patients with good prognosis from those with poor outcome. This result would aid clinicians in acquiring preventive and therapeutic methods in patients with high risk.
