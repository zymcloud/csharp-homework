This study was aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) on transcription factor EB (TFEB) during autophagy in liver cancer cells. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 was treated with Hsp90 N- and C-terminal inhibitors (STA9090 and Novobiocin), respectively. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the expression levels of TFEB and autophagy-related proteins. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to observe the ability of Hsp90α binding to the TFEB proximal promoter region. The double-luciferase gene reporter experiment was used to determine the activity of TFEB promoter. The results showed that hypoxia induced up-regulation of TFEB protein and mRNA expression levels in the HepG2 cells. The protein expression levels of TFEB, LC3 and P62 were down-regulated significantly by either STA9090 or Novobiocin, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Transfection of Hsp90α-overexpressing plasmids up-regulated TFEB protein levels in either wild-type or Hsp90α knockout HepG2 cells. Hsp90 bound to the TFEB proximal promoter region and was involved in regulating TFEB transcriptional process. Whereas both STA9090 and Novobiocin inhibited Hsp90 to bind to the TFEB proximal promoter region, and decreased the activity of TFEB promoter. These results suggest that Hsp90 promotes TFEB transcription in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by binding to the proximal promoter region, thereby up-regulating the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins.
