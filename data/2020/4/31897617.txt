Purpose:Multiple studies have demonstrated adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (aTACE) after resection improved outcomes compared to resection alone for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unlike pre-operative TACE which targets a lesion, aTACE is administered in the proximal hepatic artery to destroy cancer cells within the remaining liver. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to quantify this survival and disease-free survival (DFS) benefit.Methods:A search of five databases was performed from inception to 20 August 2019.Results:A total of 26 studies (six randomized controlled trials) involving 7817 patients were included. Patients treated with resection plus aTACE had significantly better 1-year survival (OR, 2.53 [95% CI, 1.70-3.76, p Conclusion:Post-operative aTACE is safe and improves overall and disease-free survival, with the greatest benefit in MVI-positive patients. The current evidence weakly supports the use of adjuvant TACE for patients without PVTT, with PVTT that does not involve the main trunk, with and without a resection margin Level of evidence:Level 1.
