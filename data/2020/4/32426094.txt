Background:Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of tumour recurrence after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, their role in established post-transplant HCC recurrence is uncertain.Aim:To investigate whether mTOR inhibitor offers a survival benefit in post-transplant HCC recurrence.Methods:A retrospective study of 143 patients who developed HCC recurrence after liver transplantation was performed. They were divided into 2 groups based on whether they had received mTOR inhibitor-based immunosuppression. The primary endpoint was post-recurrence survival.Results:Seventy-nine (55%) patients received an mTOR inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regime, while 64 (45%) patients did not. The mTOR inhibitor group had a lower number of recurrent tumours (2 vs 5, P = 0.02) and received more active treatments including radiotherapy (39 vs 22%, P = 0.03) and targeted therapy (59 vs 23%, P < 0.001). The median post-recurrence survival was 21.0 ± 4.1 mo in the mTOR inhibitor group and 11.2 ± 2.5 mo in the control group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that mTOR inhibitor therapy was independently associated with improved post-recurrence survival (P = 0.04, OR = 0.482, 95%CI: 0.241-0.966). The number of recurrent tumours and use of other treatment modalities did not affect survival. No survival difference was observed between mTOR inhibitor monotherapy and combination therapy with calcineurin inhibitor.Conclusion:mTOR inhibitors prolonged survival after post-transplant HCC recurrence.
