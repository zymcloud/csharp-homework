To evaluate erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma (Eph)/Eph receptor-interaction protein (ephrin) expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral epithelial precursor lesions (OEPLs), EphA2, EphB4, and ephrinB2 were examined and compared with microvessel density (MVD) and lymphatic vessel density (LVD). Samples from 73 OSCC and 43 OEPLs patients were immunohistochemically analyzed with antibodies against EphA2, EphB4, ephrinB2, CD34, and D2-40. Results were compared with clinicopathological findings. Immunohistochemical reactivity for EphA2, EphB4, and ephrinB2 was detected in epithelial cells and some stromal vascular cells in OEPLs and OSCC, proportionately with the level of malignancy. The number of blood vessel endothelial cells stained with CD34 and lymphatic vessel endothelial cells stained with D2-40 was increased in OEPLs and OSCC. In OSCC, ephrinB2 and EphB4 exhibited significant correlation with recurrence and invasion depth, respectively. MVD was significantly lower in slight lymphocytic reaction than in prominent stromal reaction. Association was found between LVD and T classification, postoperative metastasis, survival, mode of invasion, and invasion depth. Expression of EphA2, EphB4, ephrinB2, MVD, and LVD might be associated with malignant potential of the oral epithelium. Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis appear to be related to progression of potentially malignant oral lesions.
