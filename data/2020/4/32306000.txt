Objective:To establish the drug-resistant cell lines of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced by sorafenib, and to screen out the high expression genes in drug-resistant cell lines of HCC induced by sorafenib, then to explore the genes related to sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The human PLC and Huh7 cell lines were obtained, then the PLC and Huh7 drug-resistant cell lines were induced with sorafenib by using intermittent induction in vitro. CCK8 assay was used to detect the IC50 value of sorafenib for evaluation of drug sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in PLC and Huh7. All the up regulated genes in PLC and Huh7 drug-resistant cell lines induced by sorafenib were screened out using high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), Ualcan database was used to analyze the correlations between the up regulated genes in PLC and Huh7 drug-resistant cell lines induced and four clinical biological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma, including the gene expressions between normal samples and tumor samples, tumor stage, tumor grade, and patient overall survival, to find the genes that might be involved in the mechanism of sorafenib resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:All the up regulated genes detected by the using high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in PLC and Huh7 drug-resistant cell lines were further screened out by following conditions:(1) genes co-expressed in PLC and Huh7 drug-resistant cells induced by sorafenib, (2) the fold change was more than 4 times and the difference was statistically significant (P Conclusion:The human PLC and Huh7 drug-resistant cell lines of hepatocellular carcinoma induced by sorafenib were successfully established. CBX4, the gene related to sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma, was screened out by the high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and further analysis using Ualcan database, which is providing a powerful basis for further research on the mechanism of sorafenib resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma.
