Four new sesquiterpenoids, conyterpenols A - D (1-4), along with nineteen known analogues (5-23) were isolated from the aerial parts of Conyza japonica. The structures of 1-4 were determined through spectroscopic analysis, while their absolute configurations were determined by comparison of calculated and experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Conyterpenol D (4) was a new type of sesquiterpenoid with a seven-membered lactone ring. Compounds 1-23 were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against LPS-induced nitric oxide production in RAW264.7 macrophages and cytotoxicity against human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) and human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7). Compounds 3, 4, and 12 displayed moderate inhibition against NO production with IC50 values in the range of 26.4-33.6 μM. And all compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity against these two cancer cell lines at 100 μM.
