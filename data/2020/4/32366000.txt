Renal insufficiency (RI) is commonly seen in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prognostic role of albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade in this special setting is unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of ALBI grade associated with the impact of RI on HCC. A prospective cohort of 3690 HCC patients between 2002 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model were used to determine survival and independent prognostic predictors. Of all patients, RI was an independent predictor associated with decreased survival. In multivariate Cox analysis for patients with RI, α-fetoprotein level ≥20 ng/mL, tumor size >3 cm, vascular invasion, distant metastasis, presence of ascites, performance status 1-2, performance status 3-4, and ALBI grade 2 and grade 3 were independent predictors of decreased survival (all p < 0.05). In subgroup analysis of patients with RI undergoing curative and non-curative treatments, the ALBI grade remained a significant prognostic predictor associated with decreased survival (p < 0.001). In summary, HCC patients with RI have decreased survival compared to those without RI. The ALBI grade can discriminate the survival in patients with RI independent of treatment strategy and is a feasible prognostic tool in this special patient population.
