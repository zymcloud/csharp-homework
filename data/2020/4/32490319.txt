Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Society guidelines recommend surveillance with abdominal ultrasound with or without serum alpha-fetoprotein every 6 months for adults at increased risk of developing HCC. However, adherence is often suboptimal. We assessed the feasibility of a coordinated telephone outreach program for unscreened patients with cirrhosis within the Veteran's Affairs (VA) health care system. Using a patient care dashboard of advanced chronic liver disease in the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, we identified veterans with a diagnosis of cirrhosis, a platelet count â‰¤ 150,000/uL, and no documented HCC surveillance in the previous 8 months. Eligible veterans received a telephone call from a patient navigator to describe the risks and benefits of HCC surveillance. Orders for an abdominal ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein were placed for veterans who agreed to surveillance. Veterans who were not reached by telephone received an informational letter by mail to encourage participation. Of the 129 veterans who met the eligibility criteria, most were male (96.9%). The most common etiology for cirrhosis was hepatitis C (64.3%), and most of the patients had compensated cirrhosis (68.2%). The patient navigators reached 32.5% of patients by phone. Patients in each group were similar across clinical and demographic characteristics. Patients who were called were more likely to undergo surveillance (adjusted odds ratio = 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-6.33). Most of the patients (72.1%) completed abdominal imaging when reached by phone. Conclusion: Targeted outreach increased uptake of HCC surveillance among patients with cirrhosis in a large, integrated, VA health care system.
