Background:Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade has been proposed for the evaluation of liver function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The combination therapy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and sorafenib is widely used for HCC patients with preserved liver function; our study aimed to investigate and compare the discriminating values of ALBI grade and Child-Pugh score in overall survival (OS).Methods:A total of 173 HCC patients with preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A) were enrolled. The prognostic values of OS for ALBI grade and Child-Pugh score were separately investigated.Results:In multivariate analyses, both ALBI grade and Child-Pugh score could significantly stratify the patients with different OS [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.15 and 1.48, PConclusions:ALBI grade was better than Child-Pugh score in stratifying prognosis for HCC patients with preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A) and treated by the combination therapy of TACE and sorafenib.
