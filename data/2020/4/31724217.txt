Background:This study aimed to investigate the correlation of long non-coding RNA microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (lncRNA MVIH) with disease risk, disease conditions, and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and also to investigate the influence of lncRNA MVIH on AML cell activities in vitro.Methods:A total of 212 AML patients and 70 controls were consecutively recruited. Their bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were isolated, and lncRNA MVIH was detected by reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. In AML patients, complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. In vitro, lncRNA MVIH expression in AML cell lines was determined, and the effect of lncRNA MVIH on AML cell proliferation and apoptosis was assessed.Results:LncRNA MVIH expression was increased in AML patients compared to controls, and receiver operating characteristic curve showed that lncRNA MVIH predicted elevated AML risk (area under curve: 0.742 [95% CI: 0.674-0.810]). In AML patients, no correlation of lncRNA MVIH expression with French-American-British classification was observed, while lncRNA MVIH high expression correlated with worse risk stratification. Moreover, lncRNA MVIH expression negatively correlated with CR achievement, EFS and OS. In vitro, lncRNA MVIH was overexpressed in AML cell lines (KG-1, ME-1, and HT-93) compared to normal BMMCs. Furthermore, lncRNA MVIH downregulation reduced KG-1 cell proliferation but increased apoptosis, whereas lncRNA MVIH upregulation raised HL-60 cell proliferation but decreased apoptosis.Conclusion:LncRNA MVIH may not only serve as a prognostic marker but also act as a therapeutic target in AML.
