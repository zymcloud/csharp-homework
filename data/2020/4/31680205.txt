Purposes:The indication of endoscopic (laparoscopic and thoracoscopic) hepatic resection (HR) has been expanded in the past decade because of its low invasiveness. However, the indications of endoscopic HR and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have not yet been determined.Methods:Among the 906 patients hospitalized for the initial treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between 2000 and 2017, 77 underwent endoscopic partial HR (E-pHR), and 94 underwent endoscopic RFA (E-RFA). We compared the short- and long-term outcomes between the E-pHR and E-RFA groups.Results:The patients in the E-RFA group were characterized primarily by an impaired liver function. Among the patients with liver damage B or C, the overall survival (OS) in the E-pHR group was significantly worse than in the E-RFA group (3-year OS: 36% vs. 82%, p = 0.003).Conclusion:E-RFA may be recommended for the initial treatment of HCC in patients with a severely impaired liver function. However, E-pHR should be avoided as the initial treatment of HCC in such patients.
