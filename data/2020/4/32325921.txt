Background: Although lenvatinib has become the standard therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the high incidence rate of adverse events (AEs) is an issue. This study aimed to clarify the AEs of lenvatinib and the therapeutic impact of five days-on/two days-off administration (i.e., weekends-off strategy) for lenvatinib. Methods: We retrospectively assessed the therapeutic effects and AEs of 135 patients treated with lenvatinib, and the improvement of tolerability and therapeutic efficacy of 30 patients treated with the weekends-off strategy. We also evaluated lenvatinib-induced vascular changes in tumors and healthy organs using a mouse hepatoma model. Results: The incidence rates of any grade and grade â‰¥ 3 AEs were 82.1% and 49.6%. Fatigue was the most important AE since it resulted in dose reduction and discontinuation. Of the 30 patients who received weekends-off lenvatinib, 66.7% tolerated the AEs. Although 80.8% of the patients showed progression after dose reduction, the therapeutic response improved in 61.5% of the patients by weekends-off lenvatinib. Notably, weekends-off administration significantly prolonged the administration period and survival (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05). The mouse hepatoma model showed that weekends-off administration contributed to recovery of vascularity in the organs. Conclusion: Weekends-off administration of lenvatinib was useful to recover the therapeutic response and tolerability toward AEs.
