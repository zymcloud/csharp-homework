Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant cancer with high morbidity and mortality which lead to a serious burden to society. AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) is the most widely used serum biomarker to detect HCC worldwide. However, no AFP elevation have been found in many HCC and AFP analysis can't be used to screen HCC in these cases. Currently, many studies have been carried out to find reliable biomarker in diagnosing AFP-negative HCC. Such biomarker would help the diagnosis of AFP-negative HCC, ensuring the timely initiation of treatment. In this review, we highlight the important role of biomarkers that can differentiate AFP-negative HCCs, and discuss their potential clinical applications as biomarkers for the diagnosis of AFP-negative HCC.
