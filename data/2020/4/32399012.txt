18F-fluciclovine is a PET radiopharmaceutical used for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer in adult men after primary curative treatment with suspicion of recurrence based on elevated prostate-specific antigen level. Several incidental uptakes of 18F-fluciclovine in other tumour types have been described in the literature so far - in breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. Our case report presents a patient with oncological duplicity (prostate gland carcinoma and newly diagnosed neuroendocrine tumour) and with accumulation of fluciclovine in pathologically proved neuroendocrine tumour, later imagined also by octreotide SPECT/CT. To our knowledge, this is the first case of fluciclovine accumulated in a neuroendocrine tumour described in the literature.
