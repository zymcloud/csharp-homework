Objective: To investigate the differences in efficacy between drug-eluting beads transbronchial arterial chemoembolization (DEB-BACE) combined with systemic chemotherapy and systemic chemotherapy alone for unresectable lung squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: Totally 60 cases of unresectable lung squamous cell carcinoma undergoing systemic chemotherapy in Yancheng Third People Hospital were retrospectively selected as the research object. According to patients' wishes, they were divided into chemotherapy-only group (group A) and combined treatment group (group B). Group A received gemcitabine combined with cisplatin chemotherapy. DEB-BACE was applied in the first half, and systemic chemotherapy was administered in the second half (starting 3 d after BACE). The first half and the second half of the chemotherapy dose were 1/2 of the drug dose in the chemotherapy alone group. The short-term efficacy, incidence of toxic side effects, peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets, serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, and survival time were compared between the two groups. Results: After 2 cycles of treatment, the total effective rates of group A and group B were 50.0% (15/30) and 76.7% (23/30) (P<0.05), the incidence of nausea and vomiting (63.3% vs 20.0%), decreased appetite (76.7% vs 43.3%), hair loss (86.7% vs 40.0%), and bone marrow suppression (40.0% vs 10.0%) in group A were higher than in group B (all P<0.05). After 2 cycles of treatment, the levels of CD3(+), CD4(+)and CD4(+)/CD8(+)in the two groups were higher than before treatment (group A: 47.7%±6.6% vs 52.3%±7.7%, 31.5%±4.9% vs 34.7%±5.8%, 1.05±0.24 vs 1.18±0.32; group B: 49.2%±7.0% vs 62.0%±14.0%,29.2%±5.5% vs 42.2%±7.3%, 1.07±0.26 vs 1.39±0.42; all P<0.05), while the level of CD8(+)was lower than before treatment (group A: 30.4%±5.4% vs 24.5%±4.8%; group B: 29.5%±4.1% vs 21.1%±4.5%; all P<0.05). The CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD4(+)/CD8(+) levels in group A were lower than those in group B (P<0.05), while CD8(+)level was higher than in group B (P<0.05). After 2 cycles of treatment, the VEGF levels in the two groups were lower than before treatment (group A: (423±85) vs (352±64) ng/L; group B: (404±114) vs (296±66) ng/L; P<0.05), and the VEGF level in group A was higher than that in group B (P<0.05). The 1-year survival rates of groups A and B were 54.9% and 77.9%, and the 2-year survival rates were 17.2% and 41.7% (Log rank χ(2)=4.750, P=0.029). Conclusion: DEB-BACE combined with systemic chemotherapy is superior to systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of unresectable lung squamous cell carcinoma. It can reduce toxic and side effects, improve immune function and prolong survival time, which is worthy of clinical application.
