Background:Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroclearance has been considered as the treatment endpoint in HBeAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Although HBeAg seroclearance has been accomplished, some aspects are yet unclear. We investigated the cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and evaluated hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance in patients undergoing nucleos(t) ide analogue (NA)-induced HBeAg seroclearance.Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, 203 patients with CHB were HBsAg and HBeAg seropositive before NA (entecavir or tenofovir) treatment. All patient who experienced NA -induced HBeAg seroclearance were recruited. Patients with documented HBeAg seroclearance were followed-up every 6 months. Baseline characteristics and laboratory results were recorded.Results:The mean age at HBeAg seroclearance was 40 years (range, 20-84), and the mean follow-up duration was 5 years (range, 2-11). The cumulative incidence of HCC was 1.5 to 11.5% at 1 to 8 years after HBeAg seroclearance. Cirrhosis was the only significant factor for HCC development (hazard ratio [HR], 24.651; confidence interval [CI], 3.018 to 201.365; P = 0.003). The cumulative incidence of HBsAg seroclearance was 3.5 to 18.7% after 1 to 8 years from HBeAg seroclearance.Conclusions:A significant proportion of patients developed HCC after NA-induced HBeAg seroclearance. The presence of liver cirrhosis at the time of HBeAg seroclearance serves as an independent factor for HCC development. Some patients with NA-induced HBeAg seroclearance achieved HBsAg seroclearance.
