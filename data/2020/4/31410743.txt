Chronic HCV liver infection is considered one of the main causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For a selected group of patients, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx) is the most effective option to cure both liver diseases. After liver transplantation, patients may be at risk of viral infection reactivation and HCC recurrence. HCV recurrence on the transplanted organ can lead to graft cirrhosis and therefore the clearance of virus with antiviral therapies has a pivotal role on the prevention of graft damage. Nowadays, direct antiviral agents (DAAs) represent the choice treatment for HCV recurrence in liver transplanted patients, ensuring high eradication rates. We present the case of a liver transplant recipient who developed, 7 years after OLTx and immediately after a DAAs treatment, a subcutaneous abdominal mass with histological characteristics of HCC.
