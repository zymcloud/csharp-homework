Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common fatal cancer in the world and androgens are among the possible etiological factors. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited diseases caused by enzyme failure in the steroid biosynthesis of the adrenal cortex, resulting in an augmented 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione and testosterone production. While the occurrence of testicular adrenal rest tumors and adrenocortical tumors in congenital adrenal hyperplasia is well described in the literature, no data on HCC occurrence are available.Case presentation:A 35-years-old Italian man of Caucasian origin, affected by non-classic CAH due to partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency came to observation for revaluation of his adrenal picture. Besides common hormonal and biochemical analysis, an abdomen Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed, resulting in an 18 mm large nodular lesion between liver segments VII and VIII. Radiological reports matched with an increased serum Î±-fetoprotein level. A surgical removal of the lesion was performed. After that, several recurrences of the lesion, which was consequently treated by radiofrequency ablation, occurred. Every recurrence was accompanied by an increase in testosterone and steroid hormone binding globulin serum levels.Conclusions:Our report suggests the need for screening of liver lesions in males affected by this syndrome.
