Background and aim:The purpose of this study was to identify lifestyle risk factors, such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, in relation to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among chronic hepatitis C patients who have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR).Methods:This cross-sectional study was conducted between 2014 and 2017 using self-administered questionnaires and medical information at two tertiary hospitals in Osaka, Japan. Study subjects were chronic hepatitis C patients who had achieved SVR without HCC following antiviral treatment that was completed more than 1 year earlier. A logistic regression model was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the development of post-SVR HCC for each factor.Results:Of 202 participants, 18 patients were diagnosed with post-SVR HCC. After considering potential confounders, former drinkers at the time of SVR (OR, 9.51; 95% CI, 1.08-83.90) and patients with a history of gastric or duodenal ulcer (OR, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.37-12.46) were significantly associated with HCC. In addition, among patients with severe fibrosis, current smokers at the time of SVR had an increased OR for HCC compared with never smokers, with marginal significance (OR, 5.61; 95% CI, 0.97-32.63).Conclusions:In chronic hepatitis C patients with severe fibrosis, continuing smoking after achieving SVR could be a risk factor for post-SVR HCC. The relationship between gastric or duodenal ulcer history and post-SVR HCC should be investigated further.
