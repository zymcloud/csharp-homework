To achieve improved drug delivery efficiency to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), biodegradable poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) nanoparticles (NP), surface-modified with SP94 peptide, were designed for the efficient delivery of cryptotanshinone to the tumor for the treatment of HCC. Cryptotanshinone NP and SP94-NP were prepared by using nanoprecipitation. The physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of the NP and SP94-NP were characterized, and the release kinetics suggested that both NP and SP94-NP provided continuous, slow release of cryptotanshinone for 48 h. The in vitro cellular experiment demonstrated that SP94-NP significantly enhanced the cellular uptake of cryptotanshinone and induced high cytotoxicity and cellular apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. The in vivo detecting results of targeting effect using the Cy5.5 probe evidenced that SP94-NP showed an accumulation in tumor more efficiently than that of unconjugated ones. Meanwhile, SP94-NP exhibited the smallest tumor size than other groups and showed no toxicity to body. The results of this study provide a promising nanoplatform for the targeting of HCC.
