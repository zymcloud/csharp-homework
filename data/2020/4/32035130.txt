Aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Decrease in NKG2D ligand levels and exhaustion of NK cells in HCC patients are major causes of immune escape, high recurrence, poor prognosis, and low overall survival. Enhancing the susceptibility of HCC to NK cells by upregulating NKG2DLs on tumor cells is an effective treatment strategy. This study aimed to identify the effect of the Anterior gradient 2 (AGR2)-derived peptide P1, which was reported to bind to HLA-A*0201 as an epitope, on both the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I-related chains A/B (MICA/B) on HCC cells and the cytotoxicity of NK cells.Main methods:The effect of P1 on MICA/B expression on HCC cells was determined by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and flow cytometry analysis. HCC cells were pre-treated with various pathway inhibitors to identify the molecular pathways associated with P1 treatment. The cytotoxicity of NK cells toward HCC was investigated by LDH cytotoxicity assay. The tumor-suppression effect of P1 was determined in vivo using a NOD/SCID mice HCC model.Key findings:P1 significantly increased MICA/B expression on HCC cells, thereby enhancing their susceptibility to the cytotoxicity of NK cells in vitro and in vivo. Further, p38 MAPK cell signaling pathway inhibitor SB203580 significantly attenuated the effects of P1 in vivo and in vitro.Significance:P1 upregulates MICA and MICB expression on HCC cells, thereby promoting their recognition and elimination by NK cells, which makes P1 an attractive novel immunotherapy agent.
