Background: As the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mostly due to late detection at an advanced stage there is a strong need for establishing more effective strategies for early identification. We hypothesized that collagen-III and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and their ratio (CMR) are effective markers for identifying early-HCC when used alongside serum AFP, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin.Methods: We recruited 148 patients with HCC, 133 with cirrhosis and 121 with fibrosis. Liver fibrosis was staged according to METAVIR, HCC was diagnosed by on histological findings or typical imaging characteristics by ultrasound and computed tomography. Collagen-III and MMP-1 were identified based on Western blotting and quantified in sera using ELISA, liver function tests (LFTs) by routine methods.Results: Patients with HCC showed a significantly (P < 0.05) higher collagen-III and collagen-III/MMP-1 ratio (CMR) than fibrotic and cirrhotic patients. Patients with HCC showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower concentration of MMP-1 than those without. As expected, numerous LFTs were also abnormal. A score of AFP, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin together with CMR (the HCC-ABC test) was then constructed, This yielded ROC area under curves of 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.98) for identifying small tumour size (<3 cm), 0.87 (0.79-0.98) for identifying CLIP (0-1) [Cancer of the Liver Italian Program] disease severity, and 0.87 (0.74-0.93) for identifying BCLC disease severity (all p < 0.001), which is each case exceeded the predictive value of AFP.Conclusion: HCC-ABC diagnostic Test is a promising index for HCC early detection with a high degree of accuracy that may facilitate therapy.
