Background:Accurate preoperative assessment of hepatic functional reserve is essential for conducting a safe hepatectomy. In recent years, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) has been used as a noninvasive model for assessing fibrosis stage, hepatic functional reserve, and prognosis after hepatectomy with a high level of accuracy. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the clinical value of combining APRI with standardized future liver remnant (sFLR) for predicting severe post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Six hundred thirty-seven HCC patients who had undergone hepatectomy were enrolled in this study. The performance of the Child-Pugh (CP) grade, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), APRI, sFLR, and APRI-sFLR in predicting severe PHLF was assessed using the area under the ROC curve (AUC).Results:Severe PHLF was found to have developed in 101 (15.9%) patients. Multivariate logistic analyses identified that prealbumin, cirrhosis, APRI score, sFLR, and major resection were significantly associated with severe PHLF. The AUC values of the CP, MELD, APRI, and sFLR were 0.626, 0.604, 0.725, and 0.787, respectively, indicating that the APRI and sFLR showed significantly greater discriminatory abilities than CP and MELD (P Conclusion:The combination of APRI and sFLR can be considered to be a predictive factor with increased accuracy for severe PHLF in HCC patients, compared with CP grade, MELD, APRI, or sFLR alone.
