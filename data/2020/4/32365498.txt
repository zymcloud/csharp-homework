The insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-axis was implicated in cancer progression and identified as a clinically important therapeutic target. Several IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) targeting drugs including humanized monoclonal antibodies have advanced to phase II/III clinical trials, but to date, have not progressed to clinical use, due, at least in part, to interference with insulin receptor signaling and compensatory signaling by the insulin receptor (IR) isoform A that can bind IGF-II and initiate mitogenic signaling. Here we briefly review the current state of IGF-targeting biologicals, discuss some factors that may be responsible for their poor performance in the clinic and outline the stepwise bioengineering and validation of an IGF-Trap-a novel anti-cancer therapeutic that could bypass these limitations. The IGF-Trap is a heterotetramer, consisting of the entire extracellular domain of the IGF-IR fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. It binds human IGF-I and IGF-II with a three-log higher affinity than insulin and could inhibit IGF-IR driven cellular functions such as survival, proliferation and invasion in multiple carcinoma cell models in vitro. In vivo, the IGF-Trap has favorable pharmacokinetic properties and could markedly reduce metastatic outgrowth of colon and lung carcinoma cells in the liver, outperforming IGF-IR and ligand-binding monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, IGF-Trap dose-response profiles correlate with their bio-availability profiles, as measured by the IGF kinase receptor-activation (KIRA) assay, providing a novel, surrogate biomarker for drug efficacy. Our studies identify the IGF-Trap as a potent, safe, anti-cancer therapeutic that could overcome some of the obstacles encountered by IGF-targeting biologicals that have already been evaluated in clinical settings.
