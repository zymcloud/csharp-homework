Hepatitis B is a common and multiplex disease in China. Recently, epidemiological studies have shown that hepatitis B virus(HBV) infection is a high-risk factor for the development of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma(ICC). Based on a retrospective analysis of relevant literature of recent years, this article concludes that HBV-associated ICC is very different from other ICC regarding clinicopathological characteristics and treatment. Distinctive features of patients with HBV-associated ICC included younger age, preponderance of male patients, frequent elevation of alpha fetoprotein, decrease of CA19-9, frequent appearance of cirrhosis, infrequent lymph node metastasis and better prognosis. Because these clinicopathological features are similar to those of HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), we speculate that the cell origin of HBV-associated ICC and HBV-associated HCC are consistent. In addition, this article also discusses that HBV-associated ICC should be treated with surgery-based comprehensive treatment in order to improve prognosis.
