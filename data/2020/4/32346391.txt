Aims:The purpose of this research was to calculate and compare standardised incidence and mortality ratios in young adults, based on the data published by the population-based cancer registry of Metropolitan Lima.Method:A secondary analysis was carried out on the data published by the population-based cancer registry of Metropolitan Lima in its last five volumes. Calculating the standardised incidence ratio, in accordance with the World Health Organization's standard population, was done using the direct method, and the annual percentage change was calculated using the Joinpoint Regression Program.Results:From 1990 to 2012, 12,380 new cases of cancer in young adults between the ages of 20 and 49 were reported in Metropolitan Lima. The neoplasms with the highest standardised incidence ratio in the young adult male group were testicular cancer, brain and nervous system cancer, stomach cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and bowel cancer. The neoplasms with the highest standardised mortality ratio for this group were stomach cancer, brain and nervous system cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, tracheal cancer, bronchial and lung cancer and liver cancer. The neoplasms with the highest standardised incidence ratio in the young adult female group were breast cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and brain and nervous system cancer. The neoplasms with the highest standardised mortality ratio for this group were breast cancer, cervical cancer, stomach cancer, brain and nervous system cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Conclusions:Young adults represent a highly unique group, characterised by little diagnostic suspicion, distribution and aggressiveness of the neoplasms that occur in them. Assessing and reporting incidence and mortality ratios in this age group can contribute to decision making.
