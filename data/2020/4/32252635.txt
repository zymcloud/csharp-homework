Background:There are conflicting data regarding the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) treatment. Risk of HCC in HCV genotype-3 infected persons after DAA therapy is not well known.Methods:We prospectively studied HCV infected persons initiated on a DAA regimen between October 2014 and March 2017 at two centers in Pakistan. All persons were free of HCC at study initiation. HCC was confirmed based on characteristic CT scan findings. Patients were followed for 12 months after the completion of therapy.Results:A total of 662 persons initiated treatment. Median age (IQR) was 50 (41, 57) years and 48.8% were male. At baseline, 49.4% were cirrhotic, 91% were genotype 3 and 91.9% attained SVR. Treatment regimens used were: Sofosbuvir (SOF)/ribavirin (RBV)/pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN), 25.2%; SOF/RBV, 62.4%; SOF/RBV/daclatasavir (DCV), 10.6%; SOF/DCV, 2.0%. Incident HCC was detected in 42 patients (12.8%) in the 12-month period after treatment completion and was exclusively observed in those with cirrhosis. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, SVR was associated with a reduction in HCC risk (HR, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.14,0.85). In Kaplan-Meier plots by treatment regimen, those treated with SOF/RBV, SOF/RBV/DCV, or SOF/DCV regimens had a shorter HCC-free survival compared with those treated with a SOF/RBV/PEG-IFN regimen.Conclusion:In a predominantly genotype 3 cohort, incident HCC occurred frequently and early after treatment completion, and exclusively in those with pre-treatment cirrhosis. SVR reduced the risk of HCC. Treating HCV infected persons before development of cirrhosis may reduce risk of HCC.
