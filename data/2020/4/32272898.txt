Background:Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are recommended to undergo transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, TACE in combination with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is not inferior to surgical resection (SR), and the benefits of surgical resection (SR) for BCLC stage B HCC remain unclear. Hence, this study aims to compare the impact of SR, TACE+RFA, and TACE on analyzing overall survival (OS) in BCLC stage B HCC.Methods:Overall, 428 HCC patients were included in BCLC stage B, and their clinical data and OS were recorded. OS was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis.Results:One hundred forty (32.7%) patients received SR, 57 (13.3%) received TACE+RFA, and 231 (53.9%) received TACE. The OS was significantly higher in the SR group than that in the TACE+RFA group [hazard ratio (HR): 1.78; 95% confidence incidence (CI): 1.15-2.75, p = 0.009]. The OS was significantly higher in the SR group than that in the TACE group (HR: 3.17; 95% CI: 2.31-4.36, p Conclusion:The SR group had higher OS than the TACE+RFA and TACE groups in BCLC stage B HCC. Furthermore, the TACE+RFA group had higher OS than the TACE group.
