Ultrasonography (US) is a major, sustainable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance method as it provides inexpensive, real-time, and noninvasive detection. Since US findings are based on pathological features, knowledge of pathological features is essential for delivering a correct US diagnosis. Recent advances in US equipment have made it possible to provide more information, such as malignancy potential and accurate localization diagnosis of HCC. Evaluation of malignancy potential is important to determine the treatment strategy, especially for small HCC. Diagnosis of blood flow dynamics using color Doppler and contrast-enhanced US is one of the most definitive approaches for evaluating HCC malignancy potential. Recently, a new Doppler microvascular imaging technique, superb microvascular imaging, which can detect Doppler signals generated by low-velocity blood flow, was developed. A fusion imaging system, another innovative US technology, has already become an indispensable technology over the last few years not only for US-guided radiofrequency ablation but also for the detection of small, invisible HCC. This article reviews the evidence on the use of ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound with Sonazoid for the practical management of HCC.
