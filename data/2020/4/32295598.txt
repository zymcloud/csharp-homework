Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent subtype of primary liver cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC pathogenesis have not been fully understood. Emerging evidences have recently suggested the crucial role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC. Various HCC-related lncRNAs have been shown to possess aberrant expression and participate in cancerous phenotypes (e.g. persistent proliferation, evading apoptosis, accelerated vessel formation and gain of invasive capability) through their binding with DNA, RNA or proteins, or encoding small peptides. Thus, a deeper understanding of lncRNA dysregulation would provide new insights into HCC pathogenesis and novel tools for the early diagnosis and treatment of HCC. In this review, we summarize the dysregulation of lncRNAs expression in HCC and their tumor suppressive or oncogenic roles during HCC tumorigenesis. Moreover, we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic potentials of lncRNAs in HCC.
