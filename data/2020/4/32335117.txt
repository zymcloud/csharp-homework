The aim was to develop oral site-specific rate-controlled anticancer drug delivery to pacify systemic side-effects and offer effective and safe therapy for colon cancer with compressed dose and duration of treatment. The double emulsion solvent evaporation method was employed. To check functionality, DAPI-staining and in-vivo anticancer study of Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma bearing mice was tested. Histopathology of liver and kidney and Cell morphology of EAC cell was also performed. Formulated and optimized polymeric microsphere of 5-FU showed excellent physicochemical features. In-vitro, DAPI results pointed drug-treated groups displayed the prominent feature of apoptosis. The percentage of apoptotic of entrapped drug played in a dose-dependent manner. Significant decreases in EAC liquid tumors and increased life span of treated mice were observed. Rate of variation of cell morphology was more in 5-FU loaded microsphere than 5-FU injection. Hematological and biochemical parameter's and Histopathology of liver and kidney resulted that due to control released formulation have slow release rate, that gives less trace on liver and kidney function. Finally, we foresee that polymeric microsphere of 5-FU applying natural gum katira could be an assuring micro-carrier for active colon targeting delivery tool with augmented chemotherapeutic efficacy and lowering side effect against colon cancer.
