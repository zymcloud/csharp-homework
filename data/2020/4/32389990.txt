A 65-year-old man presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of abdominal pain during defecation. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT showed circumferential wall thickening with contrast effects in the sigmoid colon, and multiple metastases in the liver. Colonoscopy revealed a type 2 colon tumor that was obstructing the passage. A diagnosis of sigmoid colon cancer and multiple liver metastases was made based on laparoscopic sigmoidectomy plus D3 dissection. Pathologically, the resected specimen was diagnosed as colorectal neuroendocrine cell carcinoma(NEC)that was positive for synaptophysin and CD56. Postoperatively, 8 courses of FOLFOX plus bevacizumab(BV)therapy were administered, but CT showed remarkable increase in liver metastasis, and he died 5 months after the operation. Colorectal NEC is a very rare disease, for which no chemotherapy has been shown to be effective. Since we encounterd a case of sigmoid colon NEC with multiple liver metastases that followed a rapid course, we have presented it along with a literature review.
