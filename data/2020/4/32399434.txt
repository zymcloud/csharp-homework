Background and aims:Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) is a novel biomarker correlating with liver fibrosis stages. However, little is known about how it predicts risks of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving long-term antiviral treatment.Materials and methods:The study contained 2 parts. The first part was to explore whether M2BPGi could be an HCC predictor in 899 CHB patients receiving long-term entecavir therapy. The second part was to validate the findings in an independent cohort of 384 on-treatment CHB patients with more severe liver disease.Results:In the discovery cohort, there were 64 patients developing HCC within an average follow-up of 7.01 years. Our data showed that M2BPGi level was positively associated with HCC development. When stratifying the patients by an M2BPGi level of 1.73 (the third quartile), the high M2BPGi group was shown to have an increased HCC risk compared to the low M2BPGi group with hazard ratio of 5.80 (95% CI 3.50-9.60). Furthermore, we found that the M2BPGi level complements PAGE-B score, a well-validated HCC prediction model, to predict HCC development. Lastly, the cutoff was validated in the independent cohort, especially those with an intermediate PAGE-B score.Conclusions:In CHB patients receiving long-term antiviral treatment, serum M2BPGi level not only serves as an independent HCC predictor but also complements PAGE-B in stratifying HCC risks.
