Although microwave ablation (MWA) exhibits a high thermal efficiency, the major limitation of conventional MWA systems is the lack of predictability of the ablation zone size and shape. Therefore, a specific newer generation MWA system, The Emprint™ Ablation System with Thermosphere™ Technology, was designed to create predictable large spherical zones of ablation that are not impacted by varying tissue environments. The time required for ablation with MWA systems is short, and the shape of the necrosis is elliptical with the older systems and spherical with the new system. In addition, because MWA has no heat-sink effect, it can be used to ablate tumors adjacent to major vessels. Although these factors yield a large ablation volume and result in good local control, excessive ablation of liver tissue and unexpected ablation of surrounding organs are possible. Therefore, MWA should be carefully performed. This review highlights the efficacy and complications of MWA performed with conventional systems and the newer generation system in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MWA with the newer generation system seems to be a promising treatment option for large HCCs and secondary hepatic malignancies, with several advantages over other available ablation techniques, including conventional MWA. However, further randomized controlled trials are necessary to fully clarify the benefits and pitfalls of this new system.
