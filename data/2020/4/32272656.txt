Background:Adjuvant sorafenib may enhance the efficacy of transarterial radioembolization with yttrium-90 in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of radioembolization plus sorafenib in comparison to radioembolization alone.Methods:Out of 175 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with radioembolization between 2011 and 2018, after propensity score matching, two groups were compared: a group of 45 patients that underwent radioembolization while being on sorafenib (Group 1) and a second group of 90 patients that underwent radioembolization alone (Group 2).Results:Baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced concerning liver function and tumor burden. No significant differences in survival outcomes were identified (median overall survival 10 vs. 10 months; p = 0.711), median progression-free survival 6 vs. 7 months (p = 0.992) in Group 1 and Group 2). The objective response rate in Group 1 vs. Group 2 was 45.5% vs. 42.8% (p = 1) according to mRECIST. No differences in toxicity nor in liver decompensation rates were registered.Conclusions:The association of sorafenib does not prolong survival nor delay progression in patients treated with radioembolization. Liver toxicity does not differ among the two therapeutic schemes.
