MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been proven to be critical regulators of cancer development. To date, many of them are still in urgent need of characterisation, and role of miR-595 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. To better understand the mechanism of miR-595 in HCC development, a series of experiments were carried out to explore the effects of miR-595 on malignant behaviour in HCC. First, we found that miR-595 was downregulated in HCC tissues and cells and tightly associated with poor overall survival in HCC patients. Then, we further demonstrated that miR-595 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Additionally, animal experimental results demonstrated that miR-595 inhibited HCC carcinogenesis in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that upregulation of miR-595 expression inhibited the NF-κB signalling pathway in HCC cells. To further uncover the molecular mechanism of miR-595 action on the NF-κB signalling pathway, we identified ABCB1 as a direct target of miR-595 through bioinformatics prediction and supported our results with luciferase assays. Finally, we showed that miR-595 inhibited the NF-κB pathway by suppressing ABCB1 expression in HCC cells. Taken together, our findings uncover a pivotal role for the miR-595/ABCB1/NF-κB axis in HCC development, and this novel axis may be a suitable target for diagnostic or therapeutic interventions in HCC.
