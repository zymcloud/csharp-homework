An 82-year-old man who had multiple hepatic tumors, a gastric tumor, and ascites was referred to our hospital. On the time of our hospital visit, he had a high serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level of 1206 ng/mL. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a Borrmann Type II gastric tumor approximately 40 mm in diameter in the lesser curvature of cardia, and forceps biopsy was performed. Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration was also performed for hepatic tumor. The biopsy specimens from the gastric and hepatic tumor were diagnosed as large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), containing AFP-positive cells only sporadically by immunohistochemistry. He was diagnosed with gastric LCNEC with liver metastasis. Retrospective analysis of endoscopic data obtained at 5 months ago revealed a 0-IIc lesion, approximately 10 mm in size, in the lesser curvature of cardia, the same area of the present gastric tumor. This indicated rapid growth rate of the present tumor. The patient developed jaundice 5 days after he visited our hospital. And he died 18 days after hospital admission.
