Background:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has been extensively applied in clinical practice to detect and predict postoperative outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, due to its low sensitivity and specificity, its efficacy has been questioned. Recently, novel serum biomarkers including Golgi protein 73 (GP73) and glypican-3 (GPC-3) have shown a better discriminatory ability than AFP in detecting early HCC. The results of the combined use of GP73, GPC-3 and AFP in the diagnosis of HCC remain inconclusive. This investigation aimed to evaluate the discriminatory ability of GP73, GPC-3 and AFP to jointly identify HCC using the statistical methods of meta-analysis.Methods:Comprehensive database searches of, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Embase, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure were performed for literature dated up to 1 November, 2019. Studies relating to the diagnostic accuracy of the combination of GP73, GPC-3 and AFP in the identification of HCC were included. A random-effects model was used to pool sensitivity, specificity, the positive and negative likelihood ratios [positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR), respectively], and the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). We applied the Fagan nomogram to assess the clinical utility of joint detection. The overall detection accuracy was determined using summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) analysis. Meta-regression analysis of heterogeneity publication bias was analyzed with Stata (version 12.0).Results:Our meta-analysis focused on 12 studies involving 919 patients with HCC and 1,549 non-HCC patients. Sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR and DOR for joint detection, were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87-0.94), 0.84 (95% CI: 0.77-0.89), 5.83 (95% CI: 4.05-8.40), 0.10 (95% CI: 0.07-0.15), 57.51 (95% CI: 35.92-92.08), respectively, when pooled, and the area under the SROC curve was 0.95.Conclusions:Current evidence indicates that GP73, GPC-3 and AFP exhibit much better accuracy for the diagnosis of HCC when used in combination rather than alone or in pairs.
