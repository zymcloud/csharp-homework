Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the second leading cause of new cancer cases in the United States. Although more commonly involving hilar nodes, the liver, adrenal glands, bones, and the brain, lung cancer can metastasize to almost any organ. Metastases, although rare in the skin may be the first sign of a lung cancer or cutaneous metastases may present as a sign of recurrent disease. The incidence of cutaneous metastases from lung cancer has been reported in approximately 1% to 12 % of cases and was associated with poor prognosis. Although cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer is a rare occurrence, cutaneous metastasis involving the breast is even less common. Here, we present a case of recurrent small cell lung cancer presenting with a firm purplish cutaneous metastatic nodule in the right breast.
