Extension of tumor tissue within a vein is a recognized prognostic factor in abdominal malignancy because of its influence on tumor staging and selection of therapeutic management. With the advent of newer surgical techniques, and variable treatment strategies, imaging plays a crucial role in categorizing patients according to the tumor resectability and vascular reconstruction techniques during surgery. Understanding the clinical impact of tumor thrombus increases the awareness of the radiologist about the key findings in tumor staging and decision-making of surgical approach. Ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used individually and in combination to accurately assess the tumor thrombus. In our pictorial review, we will discuss the imaging findings and clinical consequences of tumor thrombosis in abdominal malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, renal cancer, and adrenal cortical carcinoma.
