Purpose:To evaluate the features of arterial enhancement pattern of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by triple-phase arterial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods:Data were retrospectively collected from 52 consecutive patients who underwent triple-phase arterial MRI using hepatocyte-specific contrast agents (Gd-EOB-DTPA) from January 2017 to October 2017, with a MR imaging diagnosis of HCC or FNH. The images were independently assessed by two blinded readers. Contrast enhancement ratio (CER) and liver-to-lesion contrast ratio (LLCR) were calculated. The lesions were classified visually and also based on the peak of LLCR into the following groups: (1) early arterial, (2) middle arterial and (3) late arterial. Data were eventually analysed using nonparametric tests.Results:The CER analysis showed no significant difference between HCC and FNH patients (p > 0.05). LLCRFNH were significantly higher than LLCRHCC in the early arterial (p = 0.01), but not in the middle and late arterial phases (p = 0.20 and p = 0.82, respectively). LLCRHCC presented a meaningful increase from early to middle arterial phase (p = 0.009), whereas LLCRFNH showed a decrease from middle to late arterial phase (p = 0.004). Based on the peak of LLCR, 17 (55%) FNHs were classified into early, 11 (35%) in middle and only 3 (10%) in late arterial phase groups. Similarly, 14 (34%) HCCs were categorized into early, 13 (32%) in middle and 14 (33%) in late arterial phase groups. There was a good agreement between qualitative analysis and LLCR in 85% of cases.Conclusion:The optimal visualization of FNH has been detected in early and middle arterial phases while HCC has been best observed during middle and late arterial phases.
