E2F transcription factors are associated with the development of cancer. However, the E2F family genes have not yet been studied in a comprehensive manner. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas, the present study analyzed the functions of the E2F family genes across different types of tumor. It was revealed that compared with normal tissues, the E2F family genes are highly expressed in several types of tumor tissue. Furthermore, E2F transcription factors were significantly enriched in tumor samples across different types of tumor. The high expression levels of E2F family genes were associated with an unfavorable prognosis in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Furthermore, patients with pathological T1 stage and iCluster2 molecular subtype of LIHC expressed particularly low levels of E2F family genes. The present study demonstrated that hypoâ€‘DNA methylation, DNA amplification and TP53 mutation contributed to the high expression levels of E2F family genes in cancer cells. Finally, the present study revealed that, compared with other types of tumor, the E2F family genes were specifically downregulated in patients with LIHC. The expression levels and prognostic effects of the E2F family genes were validated using the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The results of the present study revealed the biological functions of E2F family genes in the development of cancer and provided potential biomarkers for further therapeutic studies, particularly for patients with LIHC and LUAD.
