Purpose:Gene-targeting therapy provides a novel therapeutic approach for tumor treatment using genetically modified endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) as cellular carriers. This study applied EPCs armed with cytosine deaminase (CD) and endostatin (ES) fusion gene in liver cancer to explore its therapeutic effect.Materials and methods:EPCs from heart blood of male BALB/c nude mice were cultured and transfected with CD and ES fusion gene. Subsequently, these genetically modified cells were injected into mice bearing hepatoma through their tail veins. The tumor volumes and cell apoptosis were followed up.Results:Tumor volume in the group injected CD/ES-EPCs greatly decreased. The positive rate of VEGF and CD31 in the tumor tissue was lowest in the CD/ES-EPC group. Furthermore, the number of apoptotic cells was highest in the CD/ES-EPC group.Conclusion:The EPCs transfected with CD/ES inhibited tumor growth and preferentially induced tumor cell apoptosis, providing a novel methodology for cancer-targeting therapy.
