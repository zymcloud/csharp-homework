Objective:Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have promising potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to analyze the clinical significance of serum exosomal miR-320a expression in patients with HCC.Methods:A total of 104 patients with HCC, 55 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD), and 50 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Serum exosomal miR-320a levels were measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and compared among the groups. The relationships between exosomal miR-320a levels and clinicopathological factors in patients with HCC were also analyzed.Results:Serum exosomal miR-320a levels were significantly lower in patients with HCC compared with patients with CLD and healthy controls. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that serum exosomal miR-320a had good diagnostic value for distinguishing between HCC subjects and normal controls. Serum exosomal miR-320a levels were significantly elevated 1 month after surgery in patients with HCC. Moreover, serum exosomal miR-320a downregulation was strongly associated with positive lymph node metastasis, positive vein invasion, advanced TNM stage, and shorter survival. Serum exosomal miR-320a was confirmed as an independent prognostic marker for HCC.Conclusions:Collectively, these results indicate that serum exosomal miR-320a might be a potential biomarker for the detection and prognosis of HCC.
