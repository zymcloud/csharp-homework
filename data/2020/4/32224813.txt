Background:Despite steadily increasing donor age, there are no general guidelines for the use of organs from elderly donors in liver transplantation. This study focuses on identifying the recipients who are less affected from an old-donor organ graft and conversely in whom a rather unfavorable outcome is expected because of high donor age.Methods:Forty-eight thousand two hundred sixty-one adult liver transplantations, performed between 2000 and 2017 and reported to the Collaborative Transplant Study, were analyzed.Results:The proportion of â‰¥65-year-old donors has risen to >33% in recent years. The donor age has an approximately linear influence on graft survival. On average, each year's rise in the donor age was associated with a 0.9% increase in the risk of graft loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.009; P Conclusions:Consequently, older recipients and especially patients with hepatocellular carcinoma seem to be less affected by an increased donor age, whereas the donor age is an important factor in all other patient groups.
