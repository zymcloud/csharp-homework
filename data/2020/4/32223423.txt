Aim: It was controversial whether direct-acting antiviral (DAA) is better than interferon-based therapy (IBT) in preventing HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, we accomplished this large, stepwise meta-analysis. Materials & methods: The PubMed, Cochrane and ScienceDirect were searched for studies published during January 2009-March 2019. Antiviral type, number of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, number of HCC cases from CHC patients, sustained virological response (SVR) status and important covariate data were extracted from each study. Results & conclusion: It is demonstrated that antiviral treatment reduces the occurrence of HCC in patients with CHC; achieving SVR to antiviral treatment reduces HCC; DAA treatment is not better than IBT in the prophylaxis of HCC; DAA treatment and cirrhosis are independently associated with a higher incidence of HCC than IBT in middle-aged CHC patients who achieve SVR.
