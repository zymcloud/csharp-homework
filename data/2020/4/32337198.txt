Background:Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) is a rare type of malignant pancreatic cancer that represents approximately 1% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Due to its very low incidence, only a few retrospective studies are available. Although surgery is the first choice for treatment, most patients experience recurrence (mainly in the liver) and there are no clear recommendations for patients with advanced disease.Case summary:We report two patients with PACC treated with surgery who experienced tumour recurrence in the liver. Patient 1 carried a germline mutation in the APC gene. Both patients were treated with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin and gemcitabine plus capecitabine as first- and second-line therapies, respectively. After a favourable response to chemotherapy, the patients underwent radiofrequency ablation of the remaining liver metastases. For patient 1, we documented a relapse in the liver after a disease-free period of 9 mo, and treatment with gemcitabine plus capecitabine was restarted. The patient achieved a complete response, and he remains alive without evidence of disease recurrence after six years. After radiofrequency ablation, patient 2 experienced disease-free survival for 21 mo, when peritoneal relapse was diagnosed and treated with chemotherapy. The patient achieved a stable disease state for nearly two years; nevertheless, further progressive disease was documented, and he died seven years after the first relapse.Conclusion:PACC presents different biological behaviours than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Multidisciplinary treatment involving local ablative therapies may be considered for PACC.
