Introduction:N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prominent mRNA modification, plays a critical role in many physiological and pathological processes. However, the roles of m6A RNA modification in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown.Materials and methods:We investigated the mRNA expression and clinical significance of m6A-related genes using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) liver hepatocellular carcinoma cohort. Mutation, copy number variation (CNV), methylation, differential expression, and gene ontology analyses, gene set enrichment analysis and the construction of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the aberrant expression of m6A-related genes.Results:m6A-related genes were frequently dysregulated in cancers but with a cancer-specific pattern. METTL3, YTHDF2, and ZC3H13 were found to be independent prognostic factors of overall survival (OS); however, only METTL3 was found to be an independent prognostic factor of recurrence-free survival (RFS). Joint effects analysis showed the predictive capacity of combining METTL3, YTHDF2, and ZC3H13 for HCC OS. Then the potential mechanisms of METTL3 were further explored due to its prognostic role in both OS and RFS. CNV and DNA methylation, but not somatic mutations, might contribute to the abnormal upregulation of METTL3 in HCC. Significantly altered genes, microRNAs, and lncRNAs were identified, and a ceRNA regulatory network was constructed to explain the upregulation of METTL3 in HCC.Conclusions:Our study identified several m6A-related genes, especially METTL3, that could be potential prognostic biomarkers in HCC.
