Background:Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to dysregulate in many cancer types including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to examine the potential diagnostic or prognostic roles of circulating miRNAs in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC.Methods:Paired cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous liver tissue specimens of patients with HBV-related HCC were used as a discovery set for screening 800 miRNAs by a Nanostring quantitative assay. Differentially expressed miRNAs were then examined by SYBR green quantitative RT-PCR in a validation cohort of serum samples obtained from 70 patients with HBV-related HCC, 70 HBV patients without HCC and 50 healthy controls.Results:The discovery set identified miR-223-3p, miR-199a-5p and miR-451a significantly lower expressed in cancerous tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues. In the validated cohort, circulating miR-223-3p levels were significantly lower in the HCC group compared with the other groups. The combined use of serum alpha-fetoprotein and miR-223-3p displayed high sensitivity for detecting early HCC (85%) and intermediate/advanced stage HCC (100%). Additionally, serum miR-223-3p had a negative correlation with tumor size and BCLC stage. On multivariate analysis, serum miR-223-3p was identified as an independent prognostic factor of overall survival in patients with HCC. In contrast, circulating miRNA-199a-5p and miR-451a did not show any clinical benefit for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of HCC.Conclusions:Our results demonstrated that miR-223-3p was differentially expressed in cancerous compared with paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues. In addition, circulating miRNA-223-3p could represent a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker for patients with HBV-related HCC.
