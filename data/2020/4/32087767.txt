The N-degron pathway is an emerging target for anti-tumor therapies, because of its capacity to positively regulate many hallmarks of cancer, including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, motility, and survival. Thus, inhibition of the N-degron pathway offers the potential to be a highly effective anti-cancer treatment. With the use of a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated approach for selective downregulation of the four Arg/N-degron-dependent ubiquitin ligases, UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, and UBR5, we demonstrated decreased cell migration and proliferation and increased spontaneous apoptosis in cancer cells. Chronic treatment with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) loaded with siRNA in mice efficiently downregulates the expression of UBR-ubiquitin ligases in the liver without any significant toxic effects but engages the immune system and causes inflammation. However, when used in a lower dose, in combination with a chemotherapeutic drug, downregulation of the Arg/N-degron pathway E3 ligases successfully reduced tumor load by decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma, while avoiding the inflammatory response. Our study demonstrates that UBR-ubiquitin ligases of the Arg/N-degron pathway are promising targets for the development of improved therapies for many cancer types.
