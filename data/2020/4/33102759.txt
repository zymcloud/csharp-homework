Background:Sorafenib and lenvatinib are first-line systemic therapies for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the criteria for their selection remain unclear.Methods:We identified patients with unresectable HCC who were treated with sorafenib or lenvatinib between August 2009 and January 2019 at the Hokkaido University Hospital. Patients who continued treatment for >2 months, underwent evaluation by computed tomography every 2-3 months, and had complete clinical data were included. Responders were patients with objective response (OR) for lenvatinib and patients with stable disease (SD) exceeding 6 months (long-SD) or OR for sorafenib. The predictive factors for treatment response, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF)19 and 21, angiopoietin 2 (ANG2), hepatocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, were evaluated.Results:Overall, 27 and 29 patients treated with lenvatinib and sorafenib, respectively, were included. The responders for lenvatinib and sorafenib were 63% (17/27) and 38% (11/29), respectively. No significant predictive factors for treatment response were identified in patients treated with sorafenib. However, baseline serum FGF19 and ANG2 levels were significantly associated with treatment response to lenvatinib. All (9/9) patients with low baseline ANG2 and FGF19 levels who received lenvatinib achieved OR. Conversely, the OR was low (13%; 1/9) in patients with high baseline ANG2 and FGF19 levels. Responder rate was 40% (2/5) in patients with high baseline ANG2 and FGF19 levels who received sorafenib.Conclusion:This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that baseline ANG2 and FGF19 levels may aid in selecting optimal systemic therapy for patients with unresectable HCC.
