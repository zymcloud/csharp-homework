Background/aims:Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) treatment has dramatically improved since direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy was introduced. However, the use of DAA therapy in CHC patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. We investigated the DAA treatment response in CHC patients with HCC.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed CHC patients treated with DAA from 2016 to 2018. Patients were divided into two groups based on their HCC-history before DAA therapy. Baseline characteristics, sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR 12), and HCC recurrence after DAA therapy were evaluated. We also used propensity score matching (PSM) in a 2:1 ratio to reduce confounding variables.Results:A total of 192 patients were enrolled; 78.1% were treatment-naÃ¯ve, and 34.9% had liver cirrhosis (LC). Among these patients, 168 did not have HCC, and 24 had HCC. The HCC group was older (57.0 years vs. 72.0 years, p Conclusions:DAA treatment efficacy in CHC patients with or those without HCC were not significantly different, and HCC recurrence was relatively common.
