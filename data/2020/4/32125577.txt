With advances in imaging technology, images from ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be displayed simultaneously and in real time, according to the angle of the transducer. CT/MR-US fusion imaging improves the visualization of inconspicuous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and helps us to understand the three-dimensional relationship between the liver vasculature and HCC. US fusion imaging guidance facilitates improvement in the treatment response for HCC with poor conspicuity, and the rates of technical success of ablation and local tumor progression for inconspicuous HCC range from 94.4 to 100% and 0 to 8.3%, respectively. Moreover, the development of image fusion has made it possible to compare and overlay pre- and post-ablation US images. This US-US fusion imaging allows side-by-side comparison of the ablative margin, while US-US overlay fusion can visualize the ablative margin because the tumor image is projected onto the ablative hyperechoic zone. Thus, US-US overlay fusion guidance is highly effective for safety margin achievement in local ablation therapy for HCC, providing a lower risk of local tumor progression. This manuscript reviews the current status of ultrasound fusion imaging for percutaneous ablation therapy of HCC.
