Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver (UESL) is a rare and aggressive malignancy. Though the molecular underpinnings of this cancer have been largely unexplored, recurrent chromosomal breakpoints affecting a noncoding region on chr19q13, which includes the chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC), have been reported in several cases. We performed comprehensive molecular profiling on samples from 14 patients diagnosed with UESL. Congruent with prior reports, we identified structural variants in chr19q13 in 10 of 13 evaluable tumors. From whole transcriptome sequencing, we observed striking expressional activity of the entire C19MC region. Concordantly, in 7 of 7 samples undergoing miRNAseq, we observed hyperexpression of the miRNAs within this cluster to levels >100 fold compared to matched normal tissue or a non-C19MC amplified cancer cell line. Concurrent TP53 mutation or copy number loss was identified in all evaluable tumors with evidence of C19MC overexpression. We find that C19MC miRNAs exhibit significant negative correlation to TP53 regulatory miRNAs and K-Ras regulatory miRNAs. Using RNA-seq we identified that pathways relevant to cellular differentiation as well as mRNA translation machinery are transcriptionally enriched in UESL. In summary, utilizing a combination of next-generation sequencing and high-density arrays we identify the combination of C19MC hyperexpression via chromosomal structural event with TP53 mutation or loss as highly recurrent genomic features of UESL.
