Xiakemycin A (XKA), a new antibiotic in the pyranonaphthoquinone family, shows antitumor activity. However, the type of cell death induced by XKA remains elusive. In this study, we aim to investigate the type of death induced by XKA in hepatic cancer.The apoptotic features, such as chromatic agglutination, reactive oxygen species generation and membrane potential of mitochondria, in HepG2 cells treated by XKA were measured by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry. Apoptosis of HepG2 cells treated with XKA was determined by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide double staining and Western blot analysis, respectively.XKA had a significant dose-dependent elevation of chromatic agglutination, reactive oxygen species generation, Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, decrease of membrane potential. Meanwhile, in apoptotic HepG2 cells induced by XKA, robust increment was noticed in p53 expression, cleavage of PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-9.XKA showed potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Such phenomenon may be related to activation of the apoptotic pathway.
