Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection disproportionately affects African-Americans (AAs) and is a major contributor to liver failure and mortality. Genetic factors may not be the only cause in outcome disparity. We retrospectively investigated whether genetic host factors, viral genotypes, and treatment compliance in AA patients impacted the efficacy and the sustained virological response (SVR) rate of the interferon (IFN)-based treatment regimen. The medical chart review included 76 African-American patients (age ranging from 26 to 76) with varying levels of hepatitis condition. Fifty-seven (75%) of them had a clinically verifiable HCV infection and were followed by a hepatologist for 2 years at Howard University Hospital in Washington, DC. Both comprehensive metabolic profile and complete blood count analyses were performed. Among the 57 patients whose viral and IL28B genotypes were determined, sixty-eight percent (68%) were infected with viral genotype 1 and 71% harbored the CT allele of the IL28B gene. Among the 12 patients who completed treatment with IFN-based dual or triple therapy, 58% had achieved SVR 12 weeks following completion of treatment; 33% had a partial response with under 6000 viral count after 16 weeks of treatment; and there was one patient with viral genotype 1a and CT allele who did not respond to the medications. The results of this study prove that the PEG IFN-based regimen was effective in treating HCV-infected AA patients despite the current availability of new direct-acting antivirals. The major obstacles contributing to a low reduction in HCV infection and outcome in the AA community were avoidance or lack of treatment or compliance; contraindications, medication side effects, non-adherence, and payer eligibility restrictions.
