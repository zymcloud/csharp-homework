Tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 frequently serve as the surface markers of exosomes, which are involved in intercellular communication during tumor progression. KLF4 is a well-known tumor suppressor in various cancers. This study aims to investigate the relationship between KLF4 and CD9/CD81 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results showed that CD9 and CD81 were transcriptionally activated by KLF4 in HCC cell lines. Decreased expressions of CD9 and CD81 were found in most HCC tumor tissues and predicted advanced stages. Furthermore, KLF4 expression was positively associated with CD9 and CD81 expression in HCC specimens. Functionally, overexpression of CD9 and CD81 inhibited HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and silencing CD9 and CD81 displayed opposite phenotypes. Mechanistically, we found that JNK signaling pathway may be involved in the growth suppression mediated by CD9 and CD81. In addition, increased expression of KLF4, CD9 or CD81 had no obvious impact on exosome secretion from HCC cells. Collectively, we identified CD9 and CD81 as new transcriptional targets of KLF4 and the dysregulated KLF4-CD9/CD81-JNK signaling contributes to HCC development. Our findings will provide new promising targets against this disease.
