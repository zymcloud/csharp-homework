Background:Surgical and oncological outcomes in ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not well known. The objective of this study was to review and compare survival outcomes and recurrence rates between ruptured and unruptured HCC.Methods:Data of patients with ruptured HCC who underwent curative surgical resection between January 2000 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. To compare survival outcomes between ruptured and unruptured HCC, 1:2 individual matching was conducted.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 88.8%, 67.0%, and 51.9%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 51.7%, 32.8%, and 25.0%, respectively. OS and DFS rates were significantly lower in the ruptured HCC group than the matched unruptured HCC group. HCC recurred in 63 patients (70.8%), 33 (52.4%) of whom presented with both intrahepatic and extrahepatic recurrences. Mean recurrence interval was 12.6 ± 13.8 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates after recurrence were 61.6%, 40.2%, and 33.6%, respectively. Mean survival time after recurrence was 26.4 ± 29.5 months. Incidence of peritoneal seeding (PS) was 18.0%, and eight of them demonstrated solitary lesion. Mean recurrence interval was 5.9 ± 8.2 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates after recurrence were significantly lower in patients with PS (49.7%, 18.7%, and 9.3%, respectively) than in patients without PS.Conclusions:Hepatectomy in ruptured HCC did show worse survival outcome compared with unruptured HCC and bear a high risk of PS. However, surgical resection combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization could help in achieving acceptable oncological outcomes.
