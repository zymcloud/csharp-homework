Objective:To investigate the oral cancer awareness, its related knowledge among residents in Beijing.Methods:A questionnaire survey was conducted among Beijing residents (non-medical related personnel) on the knowledge of oral cancer and its prevention and treatment.Results:A total of 1 483 questionnaires were completed, including 663 males (44.6%) and 820 females (55.3%), ranging from 15 to 91 years. Lung cancer was the most mentioned as heard of (94.3%), followed by liver cancer (92.5%) and gastric cancer (92.4%), while oral cancer was the least heard of (47.7%). Family account (P=0.015), residence (P=0.028), income (P=0.024), frequency of brushing teeth (P<0.001), frequency of mouth self-examination (P<0.001) and chew betel nut chewing (P=0.015) were significantly associated with oral cancer awareness. Most respondents learned about oral cancer from TV programs (24.3%), phone news (22.0%), WeChat (11.3%) and chatting with friends or people around (14.6%). Only 34.9% knew that smoking was a risk factor of oral cancer, and this knowledge was associated with age (P=0.011), education level (P=0.007), frequency of brushing teeth (P<0.001), and frequency of mouth self-examination (P=0.002). Only 23.5% knew that drinking was a risk factor of oral cancer, and this knowledge was associated with education level (P=0.002), residence (P=0.022), frequency of brushing teeth (P=0.009), and frequency of mouth self-examination (P=0.005). Only 35.1% knew that betel nut chewing was a risk factor for oral cancer, and this knowledge was associated with age (P=0.040), education level (P=0.002), family account (P=0.002), income (P=0.005), frequency of brushing teeth (P=0.001), frequency of mouth self-examination (P<0.001), and betel nut chewing (P=0.002). Only 35.7%, 21.6% and 16.9%, respectively, knew that long-term unhealed ulcers, white plaques and red plaques in the mouth were the early signs of oral cancer.Conclusion:This survey demonstrates a general lack of public awareness and knowledge about signs and symptoms of oral cancer, and its risk factors and treatment. Some residents have not formed good oral hygiene habits. Specific measures should be taken to improve the public awareness of oral cancer and related knowledge about prevention and treatment, such as the use of various new media for the public to promote their oral health knowledge, in order to reduce the incidence of oral cancer, improve early attendance rates and the patients' survival rates.
