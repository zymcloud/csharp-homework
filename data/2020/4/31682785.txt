Background: As hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in liver cirrhosis is a major problem in public health, early and rapid prediction of HCC is urgent. We hypothesized that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the Apa1 SNP in the vitamin D receptor may help diagnosis.Methods: We recruited 3 groups: 80 HCC patients with HCV cirrhosis, 80 HCV cirrhotic patients free of HCC and 80 healthy controls. Apa1 rs7975232 SNP was detected by PCR- RFLP technique. Routine laboratory markers were determined by standard methods.Results: The Apa1 CC genotype was more frequent (75%) in HCC than in the cirrhosis (35%) and control (20%) groups (P<0.0001). CC patients were more likely to have a more severe Child-Pugh score (P=0.027) and MELD score (P<0.05). In multivariate analysis, the CC genotype out-performed AFP is determining HCC.Conclusion: Apa1 CC genotype is linked to HCC in HCV C cirrhotic patients, and so has the potential to be an independent biomarker predictor for HCC occurrence in HCV cirrhosis.
