A sandwich-type fluorescent biosensor for the determination of tumor-related exosome was designed. It is based on magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) capture and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalysis. MNPs were used as the substrate to capture exosomes by modifying the CD63 antibody on MNPs surface. After that, the biotinylated epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody was used to capture the tumor-related exosomes, which specifically express EpCAM. A novel method for the fluorescence measurement of tumor-associated exosome was achieved, with a detection limit as low as 200 (± 9) particles mL-1. The analytical range of this method is from 576 (± 15) particles mL-1 to 5.76 × 107 (± 5.1 × 105) particles mL-1. For the fluorescence measurement, the excitation wavelength was set to 320 nm. Fluorescent spectra were collected at emission wavelength in the range 370 to 550 nm; the data shown in the calibration plot were studied by using the fluorescence intensity at 406 nm. This sensor was also able to successfully detect the exosomes from the plasma of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and healthy humans. Graphical abstract Schematic representation of the sensing process of immunoassay-type biosensor based on magnetic nanoparticle capture and the fluorescence signal formed by the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalysis for tumor-related exosome determination.
