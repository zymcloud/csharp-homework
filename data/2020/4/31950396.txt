Ultrasonography (US) has the overwhelming advantages of not entailing radiation exposure and being a noninvasive, real-time, convenient, easy-to-perform, and relatively inexpensive imaging modality. It is used as the first-line imaging modality for screening, detection, and diagnosis of focal liver lesions (FLLs) [small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), in particular]. However, with the increasing demand for accurate and early diagnosis of small HCCs, newer radiologic methods need to be explored to overcome certain limitations of US. For example, the imaging is easily negatively affected by the presence of gas, rib cage, and subcutaneous fat, and is insensitive for capturing the subtle but vital information on the blood flow. It was in response to this need that new promising technologies such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound and fusion imaging were introduced for the detection of liver lesions. This paper presents an overview of the epidemiology and mechanisms of the development of HCCs, with an emphasis on the application of US in the diagnosis and treatment of FLLs. The aim of this article is to provide the state-of-the-art developments in the imaging diagnosis of FLLs and evaluation of ablation treatment of early HCCs. By keeping abreast of these recent advances, we hope that doctors and researchers working in the field of diagnosis/treatment of liver diseases will be able to discriminate benign FLLs such as regenerative nodules and focal nodular hyperplasia from HCCs, so as to avoid unnecessary repeated tumor biopsies and overtreatment. In particular, we expect that small HCCs or precancerous nodules (such as dysplastic nodules) can be accurately diagnosed and appropriately treated even at an early stage.
