Hepatic adrenal rest include ectopic adrenal tissue in the liver and adrenohepatic fusion. Long-lasting hyperstimulation of that tissue induces hyperplasia sometimes simulating true tumors. True autonomic tumors originating from ectopic adrenal tissue with or without hyperfunction are rare. Hepatic adrenal rest sometimes has similar imaging findings to lipid-rich hepatocellular carcinoma or angiomyolipoma, containing obvious lipid component. But in our cases, tumors showed hypervascular patterns similar to hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma. Therefore, adrenocortical scintigraphy with SPECT/CT should be taken into consideration to diagnose tumoral lesions in the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe with or without an obvious lipid component.
