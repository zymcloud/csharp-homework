Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is a treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, its clinical efficacy is limited to a select subset of patients. Next-generation sequencing has identified the value of tumor mutation burden (TMB) as a predictor for ICB efficacy in multiple types of tumor, including HCC. Specific driver gene mutations may be indicative of a high TMB (TMB-H) and analysis of such mutations may provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of TMB-H and potential therapeutic strategies. In the present study, a hybridization-capture method was used to target 1.45 Mb of the genomic sequence (coding sequence, 1 Mb), analyzing the somatic mutation landscape of 81 HCC tumor samples. Mutations in five genes were significantly associated with TMB-H, including mutations in tumor protein 53 (TP53), CateninÂ®1 (CTNNB1), AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A), myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) and nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCOR1). Further analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma database showed that TP53, CTNNB1 and MLL mutations were positively correlated with TMB-H. Meanwhile, mutations in ARID1A, TP53 and MLL were associated with poor overall survival of patients with HCC. Overall, TMB-H and associated driver gene mutations may have potential as predictive biomarkers of ICB therapy efficacy for treatment of patients with HCC.
