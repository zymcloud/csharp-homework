OBJECTIVE. Patient-specific organ and effective dose provides essential information for CT protocol optimization. However, such information is not readily available in the scan records. The purpose of this study was to develop a method to obtain accurate examination- and patient-specific organ and effective dose estimates by use of available scan data and patient body size information for a large cohort of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The data were randomly collected for 1200 patients who underwent CT in a 2-year period. Physical characteristics of the patients and CT technique were processed as inputs for the dose estimator. Organ and effective doses were estimated by use of the inputs and computational human phantoms matched to patients on the basis of sex and effective diameter. Size-based ratios were applied to correct for patient-phantom body size differences. RESULTS. Patients received a mean of 59.9 mGy to the lens of the eye per brain scan, 10.1 mGy to the thyroid per chest scan, 17.5 mGy to the liver per abdomen and pelvis scan, and 19.0 mGy to the liver per body scan. A factor of 2 difference in dose estimates was observed between patients of various habitus. CONCLUSION. Examination- and patient-specific organ and effective doses were estimated for 1200 adult oncology patients undergoing CT. The dose conversion factors calculated facilitate rapid organ and effective dose estimation in clinics. Compared with nonspecific dose estimation methods, patient dose estimations with data specific to the patient and examination can differ by a factor of 2.
