Cardiac-specific troponins (cTn), troponin T (cTnT) and troponin I (cTnI) are diagnostic biomarkers when myocardial infarction is suspected. Despite its clinical importance it is still not known how cTn is cleared once it is released from damaged cardiac cells. The aim of this study was to examine the clearance of cTn in the rat. A cTn preparation from pig heart was labeled with fluorescent dye or fluorine 18 (18 F). The accumulation of the fluorescence signal using organ extracts, or the 18 F signal using positron emission tomography (PET) was examined after a tail vein injection. The endocytosis of fluorescently labeled cTn was studied using a mouse hepatoma cell line. Close to 99% of the cTnT and cTnI measured with clinical immunoassays were cleared from the circulation two hours after a tail vein injection. The fluorescence signal from the fluorescently labeled cTn preparation and the radioactivity from the 18F-labeled cTn preparation mainly accumulated in the liver and kidneys. The fluorescently labeled cTn preparation was efficiently endocytosed by mouse hepatoma cells. In conclusion, we find that the liver and the kidneys are responsible for the clearance of cTn from plasma in the rat.
