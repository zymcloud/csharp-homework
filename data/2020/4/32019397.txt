Introduction: This study aimed to elucidate the regulatory role and molecular regulation mechanism of miR-130b gene in the process of invasion and metastasis of hepatocarcinoma, and provide a theoretical basis for seeking of effective prevention and treatment of new targets for hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods: The expression level of miR-130b gene in hepatocarcinoma tissues was determined by qRT-PCR. The biological function and mechanism of miR-130b gene were verified by cell and animal models, and the target gene was verified by double luciferase assay.Results: In the liver cancer tissues of patients with metastasis, the expression level of miR-130b gene was increased, and the difference was significantly significant (p < 0.05). Evaluation of independent risk factors for overall survival showed significant difference (p < 0.01). Up-regulation of miR-130b in MHCC97L- subpopulation cells significantly enhanced the invasion and migration ability, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The invasion and migration ability of MHCC97H + subpopulation cells with increased expression of miR-130b was significantly decreased, and the difference was notably significant (p < 0.05). When the expression of miR-130b in MHCC97H + subpopulation cells was inhibited, the expressions of Notch-Dll1 and SOX2, Nanog and E2F3 proteins in transplanted tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in other groups (p < 0.05). When miR-130b in MHCC97L- subpopulation cells was up-regulated, the expressions of Notch-Dll1 and Bcl-2, CCND1, Nanog and MET proteins in transplanted tumor tissues were significantly increased than those in other groups (p < 0.05). The prediction results of bioinformatics data suggest that the target gene of miR-130b may be Notch-Dll1 gene. The experiment of luciferase reporter gene confirmed that miR-130b gene can be inhibited and contains fluorescent reporter gene with complementary binding site, lost activity.Conclusion: The miR-130b gene can inhibit the protein expression of Notch-Dll1, and it can promote the invasion and metastasis of liver cancer cells.
