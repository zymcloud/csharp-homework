Introduction: Epigenetic modification is a type of gene expression and regulation that does not involve changes in DNA sequences. An increasing number of studies have proven that epigenetic modifications play an important role in the occurrence and progression of liver diseases through the gene regulation and protein expressions of hepatocellular lipid metabolism, inflammatory reaction, cell proliferation, and activation, etc.Areas covered: In this study, we elaborated and analyzed the underlying functional mechanism of epigenetic modification in alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver fibrosis (LF), viral hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and research progress of recent years.Expert opinion: The further understanding of epigenetic mechanisms that can regulate gene expression and cell phenotype leads to new insights in epigenetic control of chronic liver disease. Currently, hepatologists are exploring the role of DNA methylation, histone/chromatin modification, and non-coding RNA in specific liver pathology. These findings have led to advances in direct epigenetic biomarker testing of patient tissue or body fluid specimens, as well as quantitative analysis. Based on these findings, drug validation of some targets involved in the epigenetic mechanism of liver disease is gradually being carried out clinically.
