Liver fibrosis is a common pathological process of chronic hepatic injury, preceded by the chronic inflammation. The homeobox B13 (HOXB13) gene, a member of HOX family, plays diverse biological roles in embryonic development, carcinogenesis, and many inflammatory diseases. However, the expression of HOXB13 in chronic liver diseases including hepatic fibrosis remains to be defined. In present study, 55 patients with hepatic fibrosis, 15 patients of hepatocellular carcinoma, and 17 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Pathological specimens were collected through liver biopsy or surgical resection. The degree of hepatic inflammation (G0-G4) and fibrosis (S0-S4) of hepatic fibrosis was scored based on the modified histology activity index. Intrahepatic HOXB13 expression was analyzed using immunohistochemistry analysis. Compared with healthy subjects, both patients with hepatic fibrosis and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma exhibited significant accumulations of HOXB13+ cells in the liver (p
