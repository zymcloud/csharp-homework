Background:The associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) technique can induce a greater degree of hypertrophy of the future liver remnant (FLR) in a shorter time compared with other procedures. A robotic approach may reduce the complication rate, increasing the ability to perform classic ALPPS.Methods:We report technical and clinical considerations on the first full robotic ALPPS (stages 1 and 2) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein intrahepatic tumor thrombus.Results:The patient was a 38-year-old man with Milan-out HCC and FLR volume of 19.6%. On postoperative day (POD) 8, FLR increased to 37%; therefore, he underwent completion of ALPPS on POD 10. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged in good general conditions on POD 3.Conclusion:Robotic ALPPS is safe and feasible for selected patients with initially unresectable HCC or requiring extended resections, with good postoperative outcomes.
