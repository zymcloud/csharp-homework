Two-dimensional nanomaterial-based photothermal therapy (PTT) is currently under intensive investigation as a promising approach toward curative cancer treatment. However, high toxicity, moderate efficacy, and low uniformity in shape remain critical unresolved issues that hamper their clinical application. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing versatile nanomaterials to meet clinical expectations. To achieve this goal, we developed a stable, highly uniform in size, and nontoxic nanomaterials made of tellurium-selenium (TeSe)-based lateral heterojunction. Systemic delivery of TeSe nanoparticles in mice showed highly specific accumulation in tumors relative to other healthy tissues. Upon exposure to light, TeSe nanoparticles nearly completely eradicated lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma in preclinical models. Consistent with tumor suppression, PTT altered the tumor microenvironment and induced immense cancer cell apoptosis. Together, our findings demonstrate an exciting and promising PTT-based approach for cancer eradication.
