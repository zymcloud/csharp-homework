Purpose:This study aimed to explore the regulatory effect of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) ribonuclease mitochondrial RNA processing gene (RMRP) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The expression of RMRP in HCC tissues and cell lines was assessed by qRT-PCR. Kaplan-Meier method was utilized to analyze the correlation between RMRP expression and the survival of HCC patients. MHCC97H and HuH7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-RMRP or pcDNA3.1, respectively. MTT and flow cytometry assays were conducted to examine the proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cells, respectively. The migration and invasion of HCC cells were assessed using wound healing and transwell assaysï»¿, respectively. StarBase3.0 and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay were used to identify the target relationship between miR-766 and RMRP. A xenografted tumor model was established in rats to evaluate the effect of RMRP in vivo.Results:RMRP was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cells. Low expression of RMRP was correlated with poor survival of HCC patients. The A495 value and colony number were significantly decreased in pcDNA3.1-RMRP-transfected MHCC97H and HuH7 cells. The apoptosis rate was significantly increased in pcDNA3.1-RMRP-transfected MHCC97H and HuH7 cells. The migration rate and the number of invasive cells were significantly decreased in pcDNA3.1-RMRP-transfected MHCC97H and HuH7 cells. MiR-766 was a target of RMRP and eliminated the anti-tumor effect of RMRP on MHCC97H cells. The up-regulation of RMRP suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors in rats.Conclusion:Overexpression of RMRP suppressed the tumorigenesis of HCC by targeting miR-766.
