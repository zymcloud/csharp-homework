Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of most common cancers worldwide, however, the treatment for advanced HCC remains unsatisfactory. We focused on the function of the androgen receptor (AR) in HCC and tried to find new treatment strategy based on antiandrogen enzalutamide (Enz). Here, we found that olaparib, a FDA-approved PARP inhibitor, could enhance the cytotoxicity in HCC cells with a lower BRCA1 expression, and suppressing the AR with either Enz or AR-shRNA could further increase the olaparib sensitivity to better suppress the HCC cell growth via a synergistic mechanism that may involve suppressing the expression of BRCA1 and other DNA damage response (DDR) genes. Mechanism studies revealed that Enz/AR signaling might transcriptionally regulate the miR-146a-5p expression via binding to the Androgen Response Elements on its 5' promoter region, which could then lead to suppress the homologous recombination-related BRCA1 expression via direct binding to the mRNA 3'UTR. Preclinical studies using an in vivo mouse model also demonstrated that combining Enz plus olaparib led to better suppression of the HCC progression. Together, these in vitro/in vivo data suggest that combining Enz and olaparib may help in the development of a novel therapy to better suppress the HCC progression.
