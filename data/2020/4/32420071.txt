Background:Recent studies have suggested obesity could contribute to improved outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based treatment. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common form of chronic liver disease, is also obesity-related, but its association with the efficacy of ICI-based treatment has not yet been reported.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital between June 2015 and June 2019. NAFLD was confirmed by ultrasound examination of the abdomen. The efficacy of ICI-based treatment was evaluated based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1). Univariate analysis to compare progression-free survival (PFS) was conducted using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:A total of 223 patients with advanced NSCLC who received ICI-based treatment were included in the study, of whom 26.9% (n=60) were confirmed to have NAFLD. Patients with NAFLD were more inclined to to have non-squamous carcinoma and higher body mass index (BMI) compared with those without NAFLD. The median PFS of the entire cohort of patients was 6.6 months. Nno significant difference was found in response [objective response rate (ORR) 43.3% vs. 35.6%, P=0.289, disease control rate (DCR) 83.3% vs. 75.5%, P=0.211], nor in PFS (7.0 vs. 6.6 months, P=0.769) between the patients with (n=60) and without NAFLD (n=163). Surprisingly, in the subgroup of patients with liver metastases (LMs), there were dramatically significant differences in ORR (71.4% vs. 9.1%, P=0.013), DCR (85.7% vs. 18.2%, P=0.013), and median PFS [5.1 vs. 2.1 months, P=0.014, hazard ratio (HR): 0.244] between patients with (n=7) and without (n=11) NAFLD. Multivariate analysis revealed NAFLD to have a significant impact on PFS (P=0.017) in patients with LMs. In addition, the DCR of LMs was significantly higher in patients with NAFLD compared to those who did not have NAFLD (DCR: 42.9% vs. 0.0%, P=0.038).Conclusions:In conclusion, NAFLD holds no clinical benefit for advanced NSCLC patients who undergo ICI-based treatment, but it is associated with improved outcomes in patients with LMs.
