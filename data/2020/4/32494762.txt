Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex spectrum of disorders ranging from simple benign steatosis to more aggressive forms of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. Although not every patient with NAFLD/NASH develops liver complications, if left untreated it may eventually lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Purified diets formulated with specific nutritional components can drive the entire spectrum of NAFLD in rodent models. Although they may not perfectly replicate the clinical and histological features of human NAFLD, they provide a model to gain further understanding of disease progression in humans. Owing to the growing demand of diets for NAFLD research, and for our further understanding of how manipulation of dietary components can alter disease development, we outlined several commonly used dietary approaches for rodent models, including mice, rats, and hamsters, time frames required for disease development and whether other metabolic diseases commonly associated with NAFLD in humans occur.
