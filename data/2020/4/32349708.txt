Background:Because of high-risk behaviours, sedentary lifestyle and side effects of medications, psychiatric patients are at risk of viral hepatitis, alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We aimed to study the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhotic complications in psychiatric patients.Methods:We identified consecutive adult patients in all public hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong with psychiatric diagnoses between year 2003 and 2007 using the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System, which represents in-patient and out-patient data of approximately 80% of the 7.4-million local population. The patients were followed for liver-related events (HCC and cirrhotic complications) and deaths until December 2017. Age- and sex-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of HCC in psychiatric patients to the general population was estimated by Poisson model.Results:We included 105,763 psychiatric patients without prior liver-related events in the final analysis. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 12.4 (11.0-13.7) years, 1461 (1.4%) patients developed liver-related events; 472 (0.4%) patients developed HCC. Compared with the general population, psychiatric patients had increased incidence of HCC (SIR 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-1.57, P Conclusions:HCC, cirrhotic complications, and liver-related deaths are common in psychiatric patients, but liver diseases are often undiagnosed. More efforts are needed to identify liver diseases in the psychiatric population so that treatments and screening for HCC and varices can be provided to patients in need.
