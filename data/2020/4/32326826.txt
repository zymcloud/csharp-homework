Background: Recurrent ascites is a late manifestation of several diseases, including cancer, cirrhosis, and heart failure, invariably associated with very poor prognosis. Hence, every effort must be aimed at reducing discomfort and side effects of its management. Objective: To evaluate if peritoneal catheters (PCs) are a viable alternative treatment approach in palliative patients who fail medical management of ascites. Design: Case study. Results: We report the case of a terminal patient with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who presented refractory ascites despite serial large-volume paracentesis. A Tenckhoff percutaneous catheter was inserted, allowing for ascites' control and with no complications noted. Conclusions: PC placement was successful in controlling the patient's symptoms and ultimately improved comfort and well-being during the final stage of his life. This option should be assessed in selected patients to elevate palliative standards of care.
