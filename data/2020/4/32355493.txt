A 73-year-old male was initially treated with sorafenib for advanced stage HCC. However, the disease progressed 2 months after starting sorafenib. Progressive disease (PD) was confirmed by radiological examination, which revealed mediastinal and abdominal lymph node metastasis, pulmonary metastasis, and intrahepatic recurrence. The patient was enrolled in the REACH-2 (NCT02435433) trial and randomized to receive ramucirumab (8 mg/kg div. every 2 weeks). The patient had a Child-Pugh score of 6A and his AFP level was found to be 1,256.8 ng/mL at initiation. Radiological examination revealed PD, 5 months after starting ramucirumab. Ramucirumab treatment was continued after the confirmation of radiological PD, not but clinical progression, as allowed by the study protocol. His AFP level increased after continuous ramucirumab treatment, however, it suddenly decreased from 7,653 ng/mL to within normal limits 10 months after initiation of ramucirumab treatment. Radiological evaluation revealed a significant decrease in the size of the tumors, which constituted a partial response (PR). We reported a rare case of advanced HCC with PR to a continuous ramucirumab treatment after radiological PD.
