Sorafenib, a multitargeted kinase inhibitor, has been reported to elicit a limited therapeutic effect in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, phototherapy, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), is emerging as a powerful modality for cancer therapy. However, few studies have been reported the effectiveness of the combination of sorafenib with PDT and PTT in HCC. Herein, we designed and synthesized bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and sorafenib (SFB) nanoparticle (ZnPc/SFB@BSA). The obtained ZnPc/SFB@BSA was able to trigger PDT, PTT, and chemotherapy. After irradiation by a 730 nm light, ZnPc/SFB@BSA significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation and metastasis while promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, intravenous injection of ZnPc/SFB@BSA led to dramatically reduced tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft HCC model. More importantly, ZnPc/SFB@BSA presented low toxicity and adequate blood compatibility. Therefore, a combination of ZnPc with sorafenib via BSA-assembled nanoparticle can markedly suppress HCC growth, representing a promising strategy for HCC patients.
