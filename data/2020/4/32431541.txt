Purpose:The long noncoding RNA DLGAP1 antisense RNA 1 (DLGAP1-AS1) plays well-defined roles in the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to determine whether DLGAP1-AS1 affects the aggressive behavior of gastric cancer (GC).Methods:DLGAP1-AS1 expression in GC tissue samples and cell lines was determined by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. GC cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and tumor growth in vitro as well as in vivo were examined by the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow-cytometric analysis, transwell migration and invasion assays, and xenograft model experiments, respectively.Results:DLGAP1-AS1 was overexpressed in GC tissue samples and cell lines. Among patients with GC, the increased level of DLGAP1-AS1 correlated with tumor size, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and shorter overall survival. The knockdown of DLGAP1-AS1 suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as promoted cell apoptosis and hindered tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, DLGAP1-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA for microRNA-628-5p (miR-628-5p) in GC cells, thereby increasing the expression of the miR-628-5p target astrocyte elevated gene 1 (AEG-1). Functionally, the recovery of the miR-628-5p/AEG-1 axis output attenuated the effects of DLGAP1-AS1 knockdown in GC cells.Conclusion:DLGAP1-AS1 is a pleiotropic oncogenic lncRNA in GC. DLGAP1-AS1 plays a pivotal part in the oncogenicity of GC in vitro and in vivo by regulating the miR-628-5p/AEG-1 axis. DLGAP1-AS1, miR-628-5p, and AEG-1 form a regulatory pathway to facilitate GC progression, suggesting this pathway as an effective target for the treatment of GC.
