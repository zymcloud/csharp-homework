Here, we characterized the dioxin-like activities of 42 polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) and 6 technical Halowax formulations by using the DR-CALUX (dioxin-responsive chemically activated luciferase expression) assay with rat hepatoma luciferase-expressing H4IIE cells. Of the 42 PCNs examined, 31 showed dioxin-like activities, for which the mass-based REP-EC5TCDD (potency relative to that of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin based on the 5% effective concentration determined from the dose-response curve for 2,3,7,8-TCDD) ranged from 0.00000012 to 0.0051, indicating that some of the PCNs (e.g., 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCN and 1,2,3,4,6,7-HxCN) had dioxin-like activities that were equal to or higher than the WHO-TEFs and the mass-based REP-EC5TCDD reported for dioxins such as octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, octachlorodibenzofuran, 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB-77), 3,4,4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB-81), and 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-169). For PeCNs to OCN with high dioxin-like activities, REPs determined in previous studies were comparable to the REP values obtained in the present study. The TCDD-EQs (2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents) obtained experimentally for the Halowax formulations decreased in the order HW1051 (37 mg/kg) > HW1014 (30 mg/kg) > HW1013 (5.6 mg/kg) > HW1099 (2.9 mg/kg) > HW1001 (0.60 mg/kg) > HW1031 (<0.10 mg/kg) and were comparable to the theoretical TCDD-EQs calculated by multiplying the concentration and REP of each PCN. In addition, the theoretical TCDD-EQs for PCNs in emission gases produced by thermal processes were below the Japanese emission standard of 0.1-10 ng WHO-toxicity equivalent (TEQ)/m3N, and 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding WHO-TEQ. Based on a comparison of theoretical and experimental TCDD-EQs, we found that our REP-based approach was suitable for the risk management of industrially produced and unintentionally generated dioxin-like PCNs. This approach will be particularly useful for the risk management of unintentionally generated PCNs in emission gases because the contribution of dioxin-like PCNs to the whole dioxin-like toxicity of emission gases can be elucidated.
