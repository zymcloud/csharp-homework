Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous, multigene-driven malignant tumor. Long chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4), an enzyme has pivotal roles in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. However, its function and the underlying molecular mechanisms in HCC are still not fully elucidated. Here, we identified ACSL4 as a novel marker for AFP high subtype HCC through transcriptome profiling. ACSL4 was frequently upregulated in HCC samples and associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, ACSL4 knockdown resulted in decreased cell growth, whereas ectopic ACSL4 expression facilitated tumor formation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ACSL4 stabilized the oncoprotein c-Myc through ubiquitin-proteasome system in an ERK/FBW7-dependent manner. Cell growth ability mediated by ACSL4 elevation was partly attenuated by c-Myc depletion using siRNA or its inhibitor 10058-F4. In contrast, the effects of ACSL4 silencing were partially reversed by c-Myc overexpression via FBW7 knockdown. Clinically, ACSL4 expression was positively correlated with c-Myc in HCC. In conclusion, ACSL4 is a novel marker for AFP high subtype HCC. Our data uncovered a new mechanism by which ACSL4 promotes HCC progression via c-Myc stability mediated by ERK/FBW7/c-Myc axis and could be a valuable prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in HCC.
