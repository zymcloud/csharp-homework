Objective:The importance of circular RNAs in malignant tumors causes more attention in researchers. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most ordinary malignant tumors. Hsa_circ_0000285 was explored to identify how it functions in the metastasis of HCC.Patients and methods:Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to detect hsa_circ_0000285 expression in HCC patients' tissues. Hsa_circ_0000285 lentivirus and shRNA was constructed for the transfection of HCC cells. Wound healing assay, transwell assay, and Matrigel assay were conducted to identify the function of hsa_circ_0000285 in HCC cells. Furthermore, mechanism assays were performed to uncover the interaction between hsa_circ_0000285 and miR-599.Results:Hsa_circ_0000285 was significantly higher-expressed in HCC samples compared to that in adjacent samples. The migrated length of HCC cells was reduced after hsa_circ_0000285 was silenced, while the migrated length of HCC cells was increased after hsa_circ_0000285 was overexpressed. Moreover, the number of migrated and invaded HCC cells was reduced after hsa_circ_0000285 was silenced, while the number of migrated and invaded HCC cells was increased after hsa_circ_0000285 was overexpressed. Moreover, RT-qPCR results revealed that miR-599 was downregulated via overexpression of hsa_circ_0000285, while miR-599 was upregulated via knockdown of hsa_circ_0000285. Further experiments showed that miR-599 was a direct target of hsa_circ_0000285 in HCC.Conclusions:Hsa_circ_0000285 could enhance cell metastasis of HCC by targeting miR-599 and might be a potential therapeutic target in HCC.
