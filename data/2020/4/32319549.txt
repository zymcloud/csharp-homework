Glutathione S‑transferase Pi (GSTP1) is an isozyme encoded by the GST pi gene that plays an important regulatory role in detoxification, anti‑oxidative damage, and the occurrence of various diseases. The aim of the present study was to review the association between the expression of GSTP1 and the development and treatment of various cancers, and discuss GSTP1 methylation in several malignant tumors, such as prostate, breast and lung cancer, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma; to review the association between polymorphism of the GSTP1 gene and various diseases; and to review the effects of GSTP1 on electrophilic oxidative stress, cell signal transduction, and the regulation of carcinogenic factors. Collectively, GSTP1 plays a major role in the development of various diseases.
