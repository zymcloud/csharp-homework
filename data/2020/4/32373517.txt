Background and Aims: The best treatment modalities for elderly patients with stage I-II HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) remain controversial in an era of a shortage of liver donors. Methods: From the SEER database (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program), 2,371 elderly patients were sampled as Cohort 1. OS (Overall Survival) and CSS (Cancer-Specific Survival) were compared between the Non-surgery and Surgery groups. A stratification analysis in a CSS Cox model was also conducted among sub-groups, and propensity score matching was performed to generate Cohort 2 (746 pairs), reducing the influences of confounders. Results: For Cohort 1, the median follow-up times of the Non-surgery and Surgery groups were 11 months (95% CI, confidence interval: 9.74-12.26) vs. 49 months (44.80-53.21) in OS, and 14 months (12.33-15.67) vs. 74 months (64.74-83.26) in CSS, respectively. In the stratification analysis, for the elderly patients (age >= 70 years), Larger Resection was associated with a higher HR (hazard ratio) than Segmental Resection: 0.30 (95% CI, confidence interval: 0.22-0.41) vs. 0.29 (0.21-0.38) in 70-74 year-olds; 0.26 (0.18-0.38) vs. 0.23 (0.16-0.32) in 75-79 year-olds; 0.32 (0.21-0.49) vs. 0.21 (0.13-0.32) in those 80+ years old. For Cohort 2, a similar result could be seen in the CSS Cox forest plot. The HRs of Larger Resection and Segmental Resection were 0.27 (0.21-0.33) and 0.25 (0.20-0.31), respectively. Conclusions: It is cautiously recommended that, when liver transplantation is not available, segmental or wedge liver resection is the better treatment choice for elderly patients with stage I-II HCC (AJCC edition 6), especially those over 70 years old, compared with other surgeries, based on the SEER data.
