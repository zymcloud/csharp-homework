Objectives:To assess the predictive function of miR-21 rs1292037 A greater than G polymorphism in survival and ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:The experiment was carried out between July 2018 and July 2019, whereas the prospective clinical study was carried out between January 2014 and January 2019. In this study, 62 HCC patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV), 17 HCC patients without HBV, and 13 healthy controls were investigated. Micro-RNA-21 levels in the blood were identified using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and allele specific PCR for miR-21 rs1292037. Partial hepatectomy was performed in all patients, and the tumor development indicators and survival time were evaluated in a subsequent follow-up. Cell-based simulated IRI model of HCC huh7 cell line was used to determine the functions of miR-21 with respect to IRI and proliferation.Results:Micro-RNA-21 levels were significantly increased in HCC patients. Furthermore, an miR- 21 rs1292037 A greater than G polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with HCC prognosis and severity of liver injury after hepatectomy. In vitro study revealed that miR-21 might prevent IRI from occurring, and can induce proliferation in HCC huh7 cells. These functions of miR-21 were demonstrated to be triggered by IL-12A inhibition.Conclusion:Micro-RNA-21 rs1292037 A greater than G polymorphism can predict IRI and tumor progression by regulating the miR-21/IL-12A.axis.
