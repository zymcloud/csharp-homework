Background:The upregulation of ADAM17 has been reported to be associated with invasion and metastasis in various tumors, however the molecular mechanism of ADAM17 in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain to be clarified. Human matrix metalloproteinase 21 (MMP21), the newest member of the MMP gene family, has been suggested to play an important role in embryogenesis and tumor progression. So far, nothing is known about the relationship between ADAM17 and MMP21.Methods:In this study, the expression level of ADAM17 and MMP21 in HCC tissues was measured by immunohistochemistry. The Scratch wounding assay and Transwell were used to identify the invasion and metastasis ability. ELISA was used to evaluate the production of MMP21. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a direct association between ADAM17 and MMP21. HPLC was used to confirmed that ADAM17 participated in the maturation of MMP21.Results:Our present data indicated that ADAM17 and MMP21 was significantly upregulated in human HCC tissues. Knockdown of ADAM17 in HCC inhibited cell invasion and metastasis. Moreover, ADAM17 regulates the secretion and expression of MMP21. Furthermore we discovered a direct association between ADAM17 and MMP21, and we also found MMP21 prodomain could be cleaved by ADAM17.Conclusion:Our data suggest that ADAM17 plays an important role in the development of HCC invasion and metastasis and this function may be implement by MMP21.
