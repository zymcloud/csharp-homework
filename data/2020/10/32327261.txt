Background:Cholangiocarcinoma is the primary liver tumor forming from the biliary epithelium. Two major subtypes of this disease are distinguished because of the initial location: the extra- and intrahepatic form. The latter disease is currently a controversial indication for liver transplant (LT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of LT of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.Methods:Based on postoperative histopathologic examination of the explanted liver, 8 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were identified from all LT recipients in the period between 1994 and 2019 and included in this retrospective cohort study. Four of the patients received transplants with a preoperative diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma; the remaining tumors were incidental findings. Patient survival was the primary outcome measure.Results:Six recipients had solitary lesion with a maximum tumor diameter of 6 cm. The median carbohydrate antigen 19-9 concentration prior to LT was 52.3 U/mL. The overall survival was 75.0%, 37.5%, and 25% after the first, third, and fifth year, respectively, with a median survival of 18 months. Age (P = .758), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (P = .282), largest tumor size (P = .862), and the sum of the number of lesions and diameter of the largest tumor (P = .530) were not significantly associated with overall survival. Recurrence-free survival was 71.4% after 1 year and 28.6% after 3 and 5 years. Correspondingly, no significant predictors of worse recurrence-free survival were found.Conclusions:Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma remains associated with a very high risk of recurrence and dismal survival after LT irrespective of macroscopic disease burden.
