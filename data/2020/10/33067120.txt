Purpose:To evaluate the prognostic value of pretreatment serum γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving transarterial chemoembolization.Materials and methods:This retrospective study included 140 patients (123 male, 17 female; mean age, 56.9 y ± 12.0; range, 22.0-82.0 y) with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer class C HCC who received first-line conventional chemoembolization between December 2013 and March 2018. Patients were divided into low and high GGT groups based on a cutoff value calculated with a receiver operating characteristic curve. Overall survival (OS) was compared between groups by log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed.Results:The optimal cutoff values of GGT were 119.5 U/L in men and 175.0 U/L in women. The 6-, 9-, and 12-mo OS rates were 81.7%, 72.4%, and 62.9%, respectively, for patients in the low GGT group (n = 44) and 58.8%, 35.7%, and 28.8%, respectively, for patients in the high GGT group (n = 96; P Conclusions:Pretreatment serum GGT level was an independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with advanced HCC treated with chemoembolization, suggesting that GGT is a useful prognostic biomarker for advanced HCC.
