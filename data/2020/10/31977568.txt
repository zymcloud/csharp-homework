To evaluate the predictive value of preoperative biochemical marker [platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR)] in patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer receiving transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus targeted molecular therapy (apatinib) treatment. Clinical records of 134 patients receiving the treatment of TACE + apatinib (TACE-A) and the treatment of TACE alone were compared in a single-center study. Time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were compared between TACE-A and TACE alone groups in patients with PLR > 150 and PLR â‰¤ 150, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the prediction power of PLR. The median TTP and OS in the TACE-A group were significantly longer than those in the TACE alone group (P 150) group (P 150) and TACE alone (P = 0.232) groups in OS, but the median TTP in the TACE-A (PLR > 150) group was longer than that in the TACE alone group (P = 0.001). ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve was 0.643 and 0.623 for 6- and 12-month survival, respectively. PLR might predict the results of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma received TACE-A treatment.
