Background:The aim of this study was to clarify the feasibility of liver resection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Methods:In all, 204 patients who underwent primary liver resection for HCC between 2011 and 2019 were analyzed. Short-term and long-term outcomes were compared between the CKD and control groups. The CKD group was defined by a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 2 and chronic kidney disease Stage 3B or higher.Results:Twenty-eight patients (13.7%) had CKD. No significant differences were observed in the overall complication rates between the groups (46.4% vs. 34.7% p = 0.229). The incidence of bile leakage was significantly higher in the CKD group than in the control group (14.3% vs. 4.0% p = 0.048), and the median postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in the CKD group (11 vs. 9 days p = 0.031). No significant differences were found in the disease-free survival between the two groups (p = 0.763), but overall survival (OS) was significantly worse in the CKD group than in the control group (p = 0.022). In the multivariable analysis, a CKD diagnosis (hazard ratio, 2.261; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.139-4.486 p = 0.020) was identified as an independent poor prognostic factor for OS. The percentage of patients who died from cardiovascular disease was significantly higher in the CKD group (27.3% vs. 2.3% p = 0.023).Conclusions:Liver resection for HCC in CKD patients is associated with acceptable perioperative outcomes. However, cardiovascular disease may negatively affect the OS of CKD patients after liver resection.
