Background:Patients affected by HCC represent a vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic and may suffer from the unusual allocation of healthcare resources. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of HCC patients within six French referral centers of the metropolitan area of Paris.Materials and methods:We performed a multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study on the management of patients affected by HCC during the first six weeks of COVID-19 pandemic (exposed), compared to the same period in 2019 (unexposed). Were included all patients discussed in multidisciplinary tumor meeting (MTB) and/or undergoing radiological or surgical programmed procedure during the study period, in a curative or palliative intent. Endpoints were the number of patients with a modification in the treatment strategy, or a delay in decision-to-treatment.Results:After screening, n=670 patients were included (n=293 Exposed to COVID, n=377 Unexposed to COVID). A decrease of the numbers of patients with HCC presented in MTB in 2020 (p=0.034) and with a first diagnosis of HCC (n=104 Exposed to COVID, n=143 Unexposed to COVID, p=0.083) was find. Modification in the treatment strategy was observed in 13.1% of patients, with no differences between the two periods. Nevertheless 21.5% versus 9.5% of patients experienced a treatment delay longer than 1 month in 2020 compared to 2019 (pConclusions:In a metropolitan area highly impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decreased number of cases of HCC, and similar rates of modification in treatment strategy, but with a treatment delay significantly longer in 2020 versus 2019.
