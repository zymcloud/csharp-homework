Background:A normal albumin-to-globulin ratio (NAGR) in serum is greater than 1. Inversed albumin-to-globulin ratio (IAGR Patients and methods:Patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC between 2009 and 2016 in four centers were divided into the IAGR and NAGR groups based on their preoperative levels, and their clinical characteristics and long-term survival outcomes were compared. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS).Results:Of 693 enrolled patients, 136 (19.6%) were in the IAGR group. Their 5-year OS and RFS rates were 31.6% and 21.3%, respectively, which were significantly worse than the NAGR group (43.4% and 28.7%, both P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves in predicting 5-year OS and RFS using the albumin-to-globulin ratio were 0.68 and 0.67, respectively, which were significantly higher than albumin (0.60 and 0.59), globulin (0.56 and 0.57), Child-Pugh grading (0.61 and 0.60), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Score (0.59 and 0.58), and Albumin-Bilirubin grading (0.64 and 0.63). Multivariable analyses identified that preoperative IAGR was independently associated with worse OS (HR: 1.444, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.125-1.854, P = 0.004) and RFS (HR: 1.463, 95% CI: 1.159-1.848, P = 0.001).Conclusion:Preoperative IAGR was useful in predicting worse OS and RFS in patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC.
