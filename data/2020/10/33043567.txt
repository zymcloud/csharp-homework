Background & aims:Nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients reduces liver-related mortality. However, long-term outcomes after pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) therapy remain to be elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the long-term effectiveness and clinical outcomes of PEG-IFN therapy.Methods:A total of 190 patients treated with PEG-IFN for CHB or compensated cirrhosis were consecutively enrolled between 2005 and 2014, and 122 patients who completed the treatment were analysed. The initial response was assessed at 6 months post-treatment and defined as achieving both Results:The median follow-up period was 7.2 years. Forty-three (35.2%) patients achieved an initial response and 53 patients (43.4%) achieved a sustained response. Initial responders displayed higher rates of sustained response than noninitial responders (69.6% vs 32.5%, P Conclusions:During long-term follow-up after PEG-IFN treatment, nearly half of patients achieved sustained response without the need of further NA and these patients displayed favourable outcomes, including HBsAg loss and no disease progression.
