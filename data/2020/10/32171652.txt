Background:Hepatic Golgi protein-73 (GP73) expression is related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic expression of GP73 mRNA and protein during hepatocytes malignant transformation.Methods:Human GP73 expressions in 88 HCC tissues and their self-control surrounding tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry, and survival time of HCC patients was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. HCC model of Sprague-Dawley rats was made by diet containing 2-fluorenylacetamide. The rats were divided into the control, hepatocyte degeneration, precanceration, and HCC groups to observe GP73 protein and mRNA alterations during hepatocytes malignant transformation.Results:The GP73 expression was significantly higher in the cancerous tissues than that in the surrounding tissues, with shorter survival time, and the positive rates of GP73 protein in human HCC tissues were 53.3% at stage I, 84.0% at stage II, 84.6% at stage III, and 60.0% at stage IV, respectively. The positive rates of hepatic GP73 protein and mRNA in the rat models were none in the control group, 66.7% and 44.4% in the hepatocytes degeneration group, 88.9% and 77.8% in the hepatocytes precanceration group, and 100% in the HCC group, respectively. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.91, PConclusions:Abnormal GP73 expression may be a sensitive and valuable biomarker in hepatocarcinogensis.
