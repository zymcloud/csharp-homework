The biochemical composition of processed ascites is not well researched and may differ among institutions. This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the biochemical characteristics of processed ascites of 11 patients with liver cirrhosis and carcinoma who underwent cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy. The ascites due to carcinoma were more acidic and had higher lactate dehydrogenase activity than those due to liver cirrhosis. The ascites due to liver cirrhosis contained a higher amount of immunoglobulin than those due to carcinoma. Immunoglobulin preparations were approximately 2.95% IgG in liver cirrhosis ascites and 2.25% IgG in carcinoma ascites. Moreover, the concern about IgA infusion in the patient with IgA deficiency made it important to identify the source of the ascites. The present study provided fundamental information regarding the safety of cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy.
