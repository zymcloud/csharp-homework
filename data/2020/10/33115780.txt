Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cancer worldwide in part due to the obesity epidemic and fatty liver disease, particularly nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Chronic inflammation with the release of cytokines and chemokines with activation of hepatic stellate cells results in changes of the liver extracellular matrix (ECM) that predisposes to the development of HCC. Blood levels of the gastrointestinal peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) are increased in humans and mice consuming a high-fat diet. We found that the CCK-B receptor (CCK-BR) expression increased in the livers of mice with NASH. Treatment of mice with a CCK-BR antagonist, proglumide, prevented NASH, lowered hepatic inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, reduced oxidative stress, decreased F4/80+ hepatic macrophages, and prevented HCC. CCK-AR and CCK-BR expression was increased in both murine and human HCC cell lines compared to that of normal liver, and CCK stimulated the growth of wild-type and CCK-A receptor knockout HCC cells in vitro, but not CCK-BR knockout cells suggesting that the CCK-BR mediates proliferation. Proglumide therapy significantly reduced growth by 70% and 73% in mice bearing Dt81Hepa1-6 or in RIL-75 HCC tumors, respectively. Immunohistochemistry of a human liver tissue microarray with a selective CCK-BR antibody revealed staining of human HCC and no staining in normal liver.
