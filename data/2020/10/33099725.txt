Broncho-biliary fistula (BBF) is a rare but severe disorder defined as abnormal communication between the biliary system and bronchial tree. Cases of BBF have occasionally been reported, but no standard treatment has been established. We report two cases of BBF that developed after the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and reviewed the relevant literature. Case 1, a man in his early eighties was diagnosed with BBF 4 months after undergoing surgical resection for HCC (diameter, 7 cm; location, segments 4 and 5). Percutaneous drainage and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) improved BBF without recurrence for more than a year. Case 2, a woman in her late sixties was diagnosed with BBF after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for HCC. Although the BBF was treated with ENBD, bronchial occlusion, and percutaneous transhepatic portal vein embolization, these treatments were unsuccessful and the patient died. Although non-invasive treatments have been developed, refractory BBF still exists. The prediction of BBF and the development of more effective treatments are necessary to improve outcomes.
