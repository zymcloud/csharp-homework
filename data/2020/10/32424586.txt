Background:Postsurgical recurrence is common in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Prolonged time to surgery (TTS) may lead to tumor progression. However, the impact of TTS on HCC prognosis is controversial in Western studies and unknown in China. We aim to investigate the impact of TTS on the prognosis of Chinese HCC patients at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0-A who underwent surgery.Patients and methods:We retrospectively enrolled 967 BCLC 0-A HCC patients who underwent surgery at three tertiary centers in China. Primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to select the cutoff value of TTS. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce confounding bias, and a time-dependent Cox model was utilized to investigate factors influencing TTS.Results:The median TTS of BCLC 0-A HCC patients was 13 days (interquartile range: 10-21 days). For patients with TTS ≤ 70 days, the cutoff value of TTS was 13 days according to RCS. After PSM, corresponding 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS of the TTS > 13 days and TTS ≤ 13 days groups were 75.6%, 55.3%, 46.4% and 71.2%, 52.3%, 38.8%, respectively (P = 0.103). Corresponding 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS of TTS > 13 days and TTS ≤ 13 days groups were 93.7%, 82.8%, 69.6% and 92.4%, 78.5%, 68.4%, respectively (P = 0.580). Time-dependent Cox analysis revealed that age and tumor size were factors influencing TTS.Conclusions:Our study suggests that, for patients with TTS ≤ 70 days, prolonged TTS had no impact on BCLC 0-A Chinese HCC patients receiving surgery.
