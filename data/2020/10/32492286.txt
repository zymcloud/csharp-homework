Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common malignant tumors with poor overall prognosis. As a tumor suppressor, the function of miR-559 in HCC is not clear. In this study, quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to measure the expression of miR-559 in HCC cell lines. The effects of miR-559 on HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated through a series of functional assays. The mechanism through which miR-559 regulates HCC cells was investigated by dual-luciferase reporter assay and functional experiments. The results revealed that miR-559 expression was low in HCC cell lines. Upregulation of miR-559 suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed Golgi membrane protein 73 (GP73) as a target gene of miR-559. Moreover, miR-559 could negatively regulate GP73 expression in HCC cells. These results demonstrated that low-level expression of miR-559 was associated with HCC, and overexpression of miR-559 could inhibit HCC cell growth and invasion via targeting GP73.
