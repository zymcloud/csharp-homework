Quantum dots (QDs) are nanoparticles of inorganic semiconductors and have great promise in various applications. Many studies have indicated that mitochondria are the main organelles for the distribution and toxic effects of QDs. However, the underlying mechanism of QDs interacting with mitochondria and affecting their function is unknown. Here, we report the mechanism of toxic effects of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)-capped CdTe QDs on mitochondria. Human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells were exposed to 25, 50 and 100 Î¼mol/L of MPA-capped CdTe QDs. The results indicated that MPA-capped CdTe QDs inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation and increased the extracellular release of LDH in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, MPA-capped CdTe QDs caused reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell damage through intrinsic apoptotic pathway. MPA-capped CdTe QDs can also lead to the destruction of mitochondrial cristae, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and ATP production. Finally, we showed that MPA-capped CdTe QDs inhibited mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial inner membrane fusion and mitophagy. Taken together, MPA-capped CdTe QDs induced significant mitochondrial dysfunction, which may be caused by imbalanced mitochondrial fission/fusion and mitophagy inhibition. These findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in MPA-capped CdTe QDs-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.
