Image-guided radiofrequency ablation is frequently used to treat small hepatocellular carcinoma and metastases. Complications associated with this thermal-based technology for liver cancers arise via direct mechanical injury by the electrodes or collateral thermal damage to surrounding structures. This case report describes an unusual presentation of hepatic arterial mycotic pseudoaneurysm as melaena after percutaneous image-guided radiofrequency ablation for liver metastases in a patient with a previous surgical history of hepaticojejunostomy for cholangiocarcinoma. The patient had a lifesaving procedure to treat the hepatic pseudoaneurysm with transarterial glue embolization.
