Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a multifaceted metabolic disorder, whose spectrum covers clinical, histological and pathophysiological developments ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis, potentially evolving into cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing NAFLD, while there are no specific treatments. An ever-increasing number of high-throughput Omics investigations on the molecular pathobiology of NAFLD at the cellular, tissue and system levels produce comprehensive biochemical patient snapshots. In the clinical setting, these applications are considerably enhancing our efforts towards obtaining a holistic insight on NAFLD pathophysiology. Omics are also generating non-invasive diagnostic modalities for the distinct stages of NAFLD, that remain though to be validated in multiple, large, heterogenous and independent cohorts, both cross-sectionally as well as prospectively. Finally, they aid in developing novel therapies. By tracing the flow of information from genomics to epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and glycomics, the chief contributions of these techniques in understanding, diagnosing and treating NAFLD are summarized herein.
