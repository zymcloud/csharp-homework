Background:Hepatic lymphangioma, a malformation of the liver lymphatic system, is a rare benign neoplasm and usually coexists with other visceral lymphangiomas. Solitary hepatic lymphangioma is much more rarely seen and could cause a clinical misinterpretation as malignancy.Case summary:A 50-year-old woman with a liver mass of approximately 3.5 cm was initially diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma given the risk factors for liver cancer that she presented with, including Schistosome japonicum infection and jaundice, and also together with imaging results, which showed the mass enhanced quickly in the arterial phase and faded fast in the venous phase. The patient did not have the surgery first but received three rounds of transarterial chemoembolization because of her anxiety and fears for operation. Finally, the patient underwent laparoscopic liver segment 4b resection and cholecystectomy and was discharged from the hospital only 10 d after the operation. The pathological examination indicated the mass as hepatic lymphangioma. The patient has been followed up for 30 mo without recurrence. To raise the awareness of this misdiagnosed case and to better diagnose and treat this rare disease in future, we reviewed the published literature of solitary hepatic lymphangioma for its clinical symptoms, imaging presentation, operative techniques, histology features and prognosis.Conclusion:Solitary hepatic lymphangioma mimicking malignancy makes diagnosis difficult. Complete surgical resection is the first choice to treat solitary hepatic lymphangioma.
