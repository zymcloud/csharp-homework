Background:There is no consensus on the effect of sorafenib dosing on efficacy and toxicity in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

We aimed to verify whether age impacts on overall survival (OS) and whether a reduced starting dose impacts on OS or toxicity experienced by the elderly.Methods:In an international, multicentre cohort study, outcomes for those aged Results:Five thousand five hundred and ninety-eight patients were recruited; 792 (14.1%) were aged â‰¥75 years. The elderly were more likely to have larger tumours (>7 cm) (39 vs 33%, p Conclusions:Clinical outcomes in the elderly is equivalent to patients aged
