Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary liver cancer associated with a growing incidence and extremely high mortality. However, the pathogenic mechanism is still not fully understood. In the present study, we identified 1,631 upregulated and 1,515 downregulated genes and found that cell cycle and metabolism-related pathways or biological processes highly dysregulated in HCC. To assess the biological importance of these DEGs, we carried out weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the functional modules potentially involved in HCC pathogenesis or progression. The five modules were detected with Dynamic Tree Cut algorithm, and GO enrichment analysis revealed that these modules exhibited different biological processes or signaling pathways, such as metabolism-related pathways, cell proliferation-related pathways, and molecules in tumor microenvironment. Moreover, we also observed two immune cells, namely, cytotoxic cells and macrophage enriched in modules grey and brown, respectively, while T helper cell-2 (Th2) was enriched in module turquoise. Among the WGCNA network, four hub long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified to be associated with HCC prognostic outcomes, suggesting that coexpression network analysis could uncover lncRNAs with functional importance, which may be associated with prognostic outcomes of HCC patients. In summary, this study demonstrated that network-based analysis could identify some functional modules and some hub-lncRNAs, which may be critical for HCC pathogenesis or progression.
