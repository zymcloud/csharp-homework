Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Prognosis is often unfavorable. In this study, the effects of microRNA-802 (miR-802) on HCC progression were assessed in vivo and in vitro. miR-802 was found to be significantly upregulated in HCC tumor tissue compared to paired adjacent nontumor tissue. In vitro, transfection with a miR-802 mimic accelerated SMMC-7721 cellular proliferation, increased accumulation of the cell-cycle S-phase cell populations, as well as cell migration. In vivo injection of a miR-802 agomir promoted HCC proliferation in nude mice. Targets of miR-802 were predicted by miRWalk, miRanda, RNA22, and Targetscan. By luciferase reporter assay RUNX3 was identified as a direct target of miR-802. As judged by western blot analysis, RUNX3 was upregulated when miR-802 was inhibited. These data demonstrate increased miR-802 expression in patients with HCC and that miR-802 overexpression promotes tumor cell growth, in a RUNX3-dependent manner.
