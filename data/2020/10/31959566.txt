Background and objective:To systematically evaluate the efficacy, safety, and treatment-related outcomes between percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PtRFA) and partial hepatectomy (PH) for small primary liver cancer meeting the Milan criteria.Methods:A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. A priori protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database, and a literature search of all relevant studies published on PubMed, Cochrane library, Web of Science database, and Science Direct until July 2019 was performed. Only randomized controlled trials published in English were eligible for inclusion.Results:Of the 385 identified articles, only five randomized controlled trials involving 761 adult patients with small liver cancer were included in the final analysis. The 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival between PtRFA and PH did not reach significant difference (P-value>0.05). The long-term recurrence rate was higher and the recurrence-free survival was lower in patients treated with PtRFA compared with those treated with PH (P-value<0.05), but short-term (1-year) comparisons did not reach statistical significance. With regard to treatment-related complications, serious adverse event risks, analgesics needs, hospital stay and costs, PtRFA had significant superiority compared with PH.Conclusions:The overall treatment effects of PtRFA are comparable to PH for small liver cancer. Though patients with PtRFA have a higher long-term recurrence rate, these patients share less complications, few serious adverse event risks, less analgesics needs, shorter hospital stay, and lower costs. PtRFA may be recommended as the preferred treatment of solitary liver tumors<3cm in diameter.
