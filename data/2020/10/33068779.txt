The tropism of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for tumors forms the basis for their use as delivery vehicles for the tumor-specific transport of therapeutic genes, such as the theranostic sodium iodide symporter (NIS). Hyperthermia is used as an adjuvant for various tumor therapies and has been proposed to enhance leukocyte recruitment. Here, we describe the enhanced recruitment of adoptively applied NIS-expressing MSCs to tumors in response to regional hyperthermia. Hyperthermia (41°C, 1 h) of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HuH7) led to transiently increased production of immunomodulatory factors. MSCs showed enhanced chemotaxis to supernatants derived from heat-treated cells in a 3D live-cell tracking assay and was validated in vivo in subcutaneous HuH7 mouse xenografts. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-NIS-MSCs were applied 6-48 h after or 24-48 h before hyperthermia treatment. Using 123I-scintigraphy, thermo-stimulation (41°C, 1 h) 24 h after CMV-NIS-MSC injection resulted in a significantly increased uptake of 123I in heat-treated tumors compared with controls. Immunohistochemical staining and real-time PCR confirmed tumor-selective, temperature-dependent MSC migration. Therapeutic efficacy was significantly enhanced by combining CMV-NIS-MSC-mediated 131I therapy with regional hyperthermia. We demonstrate here for the first time that hyperthermia can significantly boost tumoral MSC recruitment, thereby significantly enhancing therapeutic efficacy of MSC-mediated NIS gene therapy.
