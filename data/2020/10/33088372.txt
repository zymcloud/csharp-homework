We describe the case of a 41-year-old woman who developed a liver neoplasm due to previous Fontan surgery for a single ventricle anomaly and pacemaker implantation. She was admitted to our hospital for moderate ascites and she was affected by hepatocellular carcinoma treated by trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Computed tomography showed features of chronic liver disease and 4 cm hepatic nodules with arterial enhancement. Laboratory analyses documented preserved liver function and increased levels of alpha-fetoprotein. TACE was performed obtaining complete necrosis at 4 weeks of follow up and significant reduction of alpha-fetoprotein after 2 months. The patient is currently in follow-up, being evaluated for further treatments and/or combined liver/heart transplantation. TACE is a therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC and with severe heart disease, like those submitted to FS.
