Purpose:Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is one of the most common liver primary tumors but its treatments are limited. Bioinformatics showed that the expression level of long non-coding RNA cancer-associated susceptibility 15 gene (CASC15) is correlated with ICC progression, but its functional mechanism remains unclear.Material and methods:Tissues from ICC patients, tumor and adjacent tissue, were used for detection of the expression of CASC15. Clinical data were also collected for clinicopathologic and survival analysis. Short interfering RNA and lentiviral short hairpin RNA were used to knock down CASC15 and PRDX2 expression in ICC cell lines, for the analysis of changes of cell function and xenografts. RNA-pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were used to detect RNA-binding protein, PRDX2. Male nude mice were used for ICC xenografts, and livers were collected after 4 weeks for immunohistochemistry.Results:CASC15 is highly expressed in ICC tissues and is related to higher TNM stage. Knockdown of CASC15 in ICC cells reduced cell proliferation, migration, invasiveness and increased apoptosis, and G1/S block. PRDX2 bound to CASC15. Knockdown of CASC15 decreased PRDX2 expression which was rescued by the inhibition of proteasome formation. Downregulation of PRDX2 resulted in G1/S block, reduced ICC cell invasion. Downregulation of CASC15 inhibited phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/c-Myc pathway through downregulating of PRDX2 and overexpressed PRDX2 rescued the block. CASC15 knockout in ICC xenografts suppressed tumor development in vivo, decreased the expression of PRDX2 and Ki67 and inhibited PI3K/AKT pathway.Conclusion:CASC15 promotes ICC possibly by targeting PRDX2 via the PI3K/AKT pathway, indicating poor prognosis and high degree of malignancy of ICC.
