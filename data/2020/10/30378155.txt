The aim of this study was to investigate the synergistic antitumor activity of rhein and doxorubicin (DOX) and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in hepatocellular SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells. Cell growth curves, caspase-3 activity, and intracellular DOX accumulation were observed using an IncuCyte real-time video imaging system. Combination index was used to calculate synergistic potential of rhein and DOX. Cell apoptosis was detected by the Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis kit. Lactate dehydrogenase and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were assessed using an assay kit. Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates were assessed by the Seahorse XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨm) was monitored with JC-1 fluorescence. Western blot analysis was used to detect the level of P-glycoprotein. Synergistic antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects were exerted by the combination of rhein at 10 μM and DOX at 2 μM in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells. Rhein could influenced the accumulation of DOX in both cells, which was associated with remarkably decreased mitochondrial energy metabolism and ATP levels. Rhein could reduce ΔΨm in both cells. mPTP, opener atractyloside (ATR) could accelerate the loss of ΔΨm, and further suppress the OCR induced by rhein. In contrast, the mPTP blocker cyclosporin A (Cs A) inhibited the loss of ΔΨm and the OCR induced by rhein. Our data indicate that a decline in mitochondrial energy metabolism was responsible for the synergistic antitumor effects of rhein and DOX in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Reduction of ΔΨm and opening of mPTP inhibited the exchange of ATP/adenosine diphosphate between mitochondrial matrix and cytoplasm is the important mechanism.
