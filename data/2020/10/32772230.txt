Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a newly identified type of noncoding RNA with a length of more than 200 nucleotides. The latest research shows that lncRNAs play important roles in the occurrence and development of human tumours by acting both as carcinogenic genes and as tumour suppressor genes. LncRNAs plays a role in various biological processes, such as cell growth, apoptosis, migration and invasion. The newly discovered lncRNA DDX11-AS1 is abnormally highly expressed in various malignant tumours, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, osteosarcoma, bladder cancer, NSCLC and gastric cancer. DDX11-AS1 mainly regulates the expression of related genes through direct or indirect ways to perform its functions in carcinogenicity. These results indicate that DDX11-AS1 may be a marker or therapeutic target of tumours. This review summarizes the biological function and mechanism of DDX11-AS1 in the process of tumour development.
