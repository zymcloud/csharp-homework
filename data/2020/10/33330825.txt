Primary liver cancer (PLC) is currently the fourth most common malignancy and accounts for the second most cancer-related deaths in China. Since 2017, a great deal of high-level evidence, and particularly evidence based on Chinese studies and practice, has emerged in terms of diagnosis, staging, and treatment. A new version of the guidelines for the management of PLC specifying the diagnosis and treatment of PLC (2019 edition) has recently been published.

The guidelines need to be further implemented in clinical practice to demonstrate their validity.
