The incidence and mortality rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nowadays is still at high levels. The regulatory roles of pseudogene in cancers have been gradually recognized in recent years. However, comprehensive investigation of abnormally expressed pseudogene and related mechanisms in HCC remains lacking. GSE124535 dataset was used to identify differentially expressed pseudogenes in HCC tissues compared with normal tissues. Prognostic value of these differentially expressed pseudogenes was analyzed at GEPIA. StarBase used to analyze microRNAs (miRNAs) can bind with pseudogene, while the targets for these miRNAs were analyzed at miRTarBase. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was then established for miRNA targets, after that hub genes were selected. Expression correlation of pseudogene and hub genes was analyzed at StarBase. In total, 16 upregulated and 17 downregulated pseudogenes were identified. Pseudogene HSPB1P1 was identified abnormally expressed in 20 types of human cancers and could be used as an indicator for poorer overall survival of patients with HCC. Functional analyses showed that HSPB1P1 was strongly correlated with signaling pathways related to cancer progression. Further studied revealed that HSPB1P1 could direct regulate the EZH2 expression in HCC. In summary, our study indicated that HSPB1P1 was a predictor for poorer overall survival of patients with HCC and may be potential therapeutic target against HCC.
