Abnormally expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to affect the occurrence and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by modulating the autophagy axis. However, none of studies has explored the clinical significance of these autophagy-related lncRNAs in HCC comprehensively. In this study, the RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, and clinical data of normal and HCC patients from the TCGA database and autophagy genes from the Human Autophagy Database were extracted. Subsequently, we screened out 78 differentially expressed autophagy-related lncRNAs, and four prognostic-related lncRNAs (LUCAT1, AC099850.3, ZFPM2-AS1, and AC009005.1) were eventually used to develop the prognostic model. This signature could be regarded as an independent prognostic signature for HCC patients and has the highest prediction efficiency than other clinicopathological factors for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival (AUC = 0.764, 0.738, and 0.717, respectively). Additionally, regardless of whether the clinical information is complete for HCC patients, the autophagy-related lncRNA model shows a good predictive power for the overall survival. Importantly, the coexpression network of 4 lncRNAs and 11 autophagy-related genes was constructed. Moreover, based on the bioinformatic analyses, our results found that LUCAT1 and ZFPM2-AS1 may affect the autophagic activity in HCC through the hsa-miR-495-3p/DLC1 and hsa-miR-515-5p/DAPK2 axis, respectively. In conclusion, we establish an effective prognostic model for HCC patients and shed new light on the autophagy-related regulatory mechanisms of the identified lncRNAs.
