Objective:To investigate the anti-carcinogenic effect of metronomic Celecoxib (i.e., frequent administration in clinically available doses) against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the perspective of metastasis, spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis, cancer invasion, proliferation, and stemness in vivo and in vitro.Background:Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is known to cause anti-carcinogenic effects for HCC in suprapharmacological doses. However, the effects of metronomic Celecoxib treatment on HCC cells remain unclear.Methods:The in vivo chemopreventive effect of metronomic Celecoxib (10mg/kg/d) was investigated by the syngeneic HCC implantation model and spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis in HBV-transgenic(HBVtg) mice individually. HCC cell lines were treated by either suprapharmacological (100 μM) or metronomic (4 μM) Celecoxib therapy. Anti-carcinogenic effects were evaluated using cell invasion, cancer proliferation, angiogenesis, and phenotype of cancer stem/progenitor cells (CSPC). The molecular mechanism of metronomic Celecoxib on HCC was dissected using Luciferase assay.Results:In vivo metronomic Celecoxib exerted its chemopreventive effect by significantly reducing tumor growth of implanted syngeneic HCC and spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis in HBVtg mice. Unlike suprapharmacological dose, metronomic Celecoxib can only inhibit HCC cell invasion after a 7-day course of treatment via NF-κB/MMP9 dependent, COX2/PGE2 independent pathway. Metronomic Celecoxib also significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation after a 7-day or 30-day culture. Besides, metronomic Celecoxib reduced CSPC phenotype by diminishing sphere formation, percentage of CD90+ population in sphere cells, and expression of CSPC markers.Conclusions:Metronomic Celecoxib should be investigated clinically as a chemopreventive agent for selected high-risk HCC patients (e.g., HCC patients after curative treatments).
