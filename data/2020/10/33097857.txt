Little is known about the mutational landscape of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and predictive biomarkers of response to systemic therapies are lacking. We aimed to describe the mutational landscape of advanced HCC and to identify predictors of primary resistance to systemic therapies using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). We prospectively enrolled 121 patients between October 2015 and January 2019. We performed targeted ultra-deep sequencing of 25 genes and Digital Droplet PCR of TERT promoter, including sequential samples throughout treatment. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) stratified by mutation profiles in ctDNA. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and objective response rate. The most frequent mutations in ctDNA of advanced HCC were TERT promoter (51%), TP53 (32%), CTNNB1 (17%), PTEN (8%), AXIN1, ARID2, KMT2D, and TSC2 (each 6%). TP53 and CTNNB1 mutations were mutually exclusive. Patients with mutations in the PI3K/MTOR pathway had significantly shorter PFS than those without these mutations after tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2.1 vs 3.7 months, p
