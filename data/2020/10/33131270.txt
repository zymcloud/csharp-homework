Studies have shown that swertiamarin (STM) has multiple biological activities, but its anti-tumour effects and molecular mechanisms are still unclear. The present research aimed to validate the STM's impacts on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, and to study its potential mechanism. Two HCC cell lines were treated with STM. Tumour growth was observed by the mouse tumour xenografts model. HCC cell lines stably expressing T-cell lymphomas 1 (FRAT1) were generated by lentivirusmediated overexpression. Cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion were observed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), the xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analyzer system (RTCA), and transwell analysis, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to observe the expression of FRAT1 and proteins related to the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Tumour growth was inhibited by STM in vivo. STM suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. STM negatively regulated FRAT1 expression, whereas overexpressed FRAT1 blocked the anti-tumour function of STM. The results revealed that STM suppressed the FRAT1/Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. The findings of this study provide new insights into investigation of therapeutic strategies against HCC.
