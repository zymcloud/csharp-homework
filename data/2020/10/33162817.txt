Background: Fidgetin (FIGN), a conserved ATP-dependent enzyme, is regarded as a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk gene, but the prognostic implication of FIGN in HCC remains obscure. In this study, we investigate the expression of FIGN in HCC and to evaluate its prognostic value. Methods: A total of 216 patients with HCC who experienced hepatectomy were recruited in this study. The expression of FIGN in HCC samples was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting analysis. And Cox regression model was used to evaluate the prognostic value of all covariates. Results: Of the 216 HCC patients, 67 (31.0%) had tumors with high FIGN expression and 149 (69.0%) had tumors with low FIGN expression. FIGN expression was positively correlated with TNM stage (P = 0.039), tumor with incomplete capsule (P = 0.036), microvascular invasion (P = 0.023), and portal vein tumor thrombus (P = 0.003). High expression of FIGN indicated shorter overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio: 4.569, P = 0.036) and disease-free survival (DFS) (hazard ratio: 6.487, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Our results indicate that high Fidgetin expression is associated with tumor progression and suggest a worse prognosis in HCC. Fidgetin might serve as a potential target for therapy.
