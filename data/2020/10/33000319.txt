Purpose:To compare lung shunt fraction (LSF) prior to Y-90 radioembolization calculated using planar imaging versus SPECT/CT in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A single institution retrospective analysis of technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin (Tc-99m MAA) LSF studies for 293 consecutive patients with HCC between 2013 and 2018 was performed. LSF using planar imaging (PLSF) was compared to retrospectively calculated LSF using SPECT/CT (SLSF) via semiautomated segmentation using MIM v.6.9. Sub-analyses of patients were performed based on PLSF range, tumor size, BCLC stage, and Child-Pugh (C-P) score. Mean LSF absolute discrepancy between sub-groups was analyzed. Comparisons were performed using paired t tests and linear regression analysis.Results:Mean PLSF, 8.27%, was greater than mean SLSF, 3.27% (p Conclusion:In patients with HCC, SLSF is significantly lower compared to PLSF, with a greater discrepancy among patients with a PLSF ≥ 20%, tumor size ≥ 5 cm, and worse C-P score.Level of evidence:Level 3, Retrospective Study.
