In this work, a novel embolic microspheres with micro nano binary progressive structure (MN-Ms) were developed for transarterial chemoembolization (TCE) applications. The Bletilla striata polysaccharide (Bsp) polymer can inhibit neovascularization and having a dimensional porous network structure, which as the first level of micron structure (microspheres) and will play a role on tumor embolization and inhibition of ischemia-induced neovascularization. The nano flexible liposomes which were embedded by the Bsp polymer microspheres as the second level nano structure to deliver drug across biological membrane barriers. And the micro nano binary progressive structure of MN-Ms was easily formed by using an emulsion crosslinking method. The MN-Ms appeared as perfect round shape with desired swelling and suspensibility characteristics, this was very convenient for embolizing operation by TCE. Due to the binary progressive structure, the MN-Ms could effectively site-specific delivery drug to the targeted liver tissue by enhancing the permeability of Sodium dimethyl-cantharidate (SC) across vessel walls & tissue matrix and delaying drug release at the site of administration, this caused the administrated SC mostly accumulated in the liver, also a higher cytotoxicity to human hepatoma cells. This work indicate that the MN-Ms may be a promising embolic agent for TCE applications for advanced liver cancer.
