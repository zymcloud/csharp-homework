Background:Gastric cancer (GC) is a digestive system cancer with a high mortality rate globally. Previous experiences and studies have provided clinicians with ample evidence to diagnose and treat patients with reasonable therapeutic options. However, there remains a need for sensitive biomarkers that can provide clues for early diagnosis and prognosis assessment.Results:We found 610 independent prognosis-related 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites (P Conclusions:This is the first study to separate GC into different molecular subtypes based on the CpG sites using a large number of samples. We constructed an effective prognosis risk model that can identify high-risk GC patients. The key CpGs sites or their corresponding genes such as TGFβ2 identified in this research can provide new clues that will enable gastroenterologists to make diagnosis or personalized prognosis assessments and better understand this disease.
