Objective: To understand the effectiveness and safety sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) combination ±ribavirin in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in China. Methods: A total of 96 Chinese adults with chronic HCV infection who were treated with SOF/VEL combination ± ribavirin for 12 weeks between July 2018 and February 2020 were selected. HCV RNA, routine blood test, liver, kidney and coagulation function, abdominal Color Doppler ultrasound or CT and liver stiffness were detected at baseline, 4 weeks of treatment, end of treatment and 12 weeks of follow-up. Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities during the treatment were recorded. A t-test was used to compare the measurement data between the two groups, and the analysis of variance was used for multiple group comparison. Results: A total of 93 cases (96.9%) achieved sustained virological response (SVR12), of which 3 cases had relapsed. 88 cases (91.7%, 88/96) had achieved rapid virological response (RVR). 96 cases (100%) had achieved virological response by the end of treatment (EOT). In patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, the average baseline Child-Pugh score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 7.4±1.0, and 11.4±1.7, respectively. Among them, 12 cases of the SOF/VEL combined with RBV treatment had achieved SVR12 (100%) at 12 weeks, while only 3 of the 5 cases of single-tablet regimen of SOF/VEL had achieved SVR12 (60%). There was no significant difference between creatinine levels and baseline during or 12 weeks after treatment. The incidence of adverse events in patients with chronic hepatitis C and compensated cirrhosis was 6.3% (5/79), while that in patients with decompensated cirrhosis was 35.3% (6/17). The most common adverse events were hyperbilirubinemia, fatigue and anemia. There were no serious adverse events, deaths or discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events. Conclusion: SOF/VEL combination ± ribavirin in the treatment of various common genotypes of chronic hepatitis C, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma has higher SVR12 in China, and the tolerance and safety are good.
