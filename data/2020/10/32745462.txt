Patients with thalassemia exhibit an increased risk of thrombotic events that is augmented after splenectomy. Heparanase protein enhances cancer progression, angiogenesis, and inflammation; it also activates the coagulation system through direct interaction with tissue factor (TF). Additionally, erythropoietin, which is elevated in anemic patients, up-regulates heparanase expression via the Janus kinase 2 (JAK-2) pathway. This study aimed was to explore the heparanase profile in thalassemia. Coagulation factors were analyzed via immunostaining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and heparanase procoagulant activity assay. In spleen specimens of thalassemia major patients, a higher level of heparanase staining was observed compared with control spleens resected after trauma (P < 0.001). Higher heparanase levels, heparanase and TF procoagulant activity, and erythropoietin levels were found in the plasma of 67 thalassemia major patients compared with 29 control subjects. No difference was found in pediatric patients (23 of 67) compared with adults or splenectomized versus nonsplenectomized patients. Higher levels of heparanase, TF, TF pathway inhibitor, and TF pathway inhibitor-2 were observed in liver, spleen, heart, and kidney tissues of thalassemia intermedia mice (Hbbth3/+). These protein levels significantly reduced when mice were treated with the JAK-2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (P < 0.0001). In summary, heparanase levels are elevated in thalassemia, which may contribute to thrombotic phenomena in these patients. Inhibition of heparanase or the JAK-2 pathway may reduce thrombotic risk in thalassemia.
