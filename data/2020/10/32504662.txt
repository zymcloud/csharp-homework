Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) refers to a condition where replication-competent HBV DNA is present in the liver, with or without HBV DNA in the blood, in individuals with serum HBsAg negativity assessed by currently available assays. The episomal covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in OBI is in a low replicative state. Viral gene expression is mediated by epigenetic control of HBV transcription, including the HBV CpG island methylation pathway and post-translational modification of cccDNA-bound histone, with a different pattern from patients with chronic HBV infection. The prevalence of OBI varies tremendously across patient populations owing to numerous factors, such as geographic location, assay characteristics, host immune response, coinfection with other viruses, and vaccination status. Apart from the risk of viral reactivation upon immunosuppression and the risk of transmission of HBV, OBI has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic HCV infection, those with cryptogenic or known liver disease, and in patients with HBsAg seroclearance after chronic HBV infection. An increasing number of prospective studies and meta-analyses have reported a higher incidence of HCC in patients with HCV and OBI, as well as more advanced tumour histological grades and earlier age of HCC diagnosis, compared with patients without OBI. The proposed pathogenetic mechanisms of OBI-related HCC include the influence of HBV DNA integration on the hepatocyte cell cycle, the production of pro-oncogenic proteins (HBx protein and mutated surface proteins), and persistent low-grade necroinflammation (contributing to the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis). There remain uncertainties about exactly how, and in what order, these mechanisms drive the development of tumours in patients with OBI.
