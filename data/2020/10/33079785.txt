Background:The mechanisms underlying de-novo hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is still under investigation. This work aims to study P53 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as possible diagnostics of de-novo hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following DAAs in comparison to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).Method:This case-control study included 166 patients with liver cirrhosis divided into group-1: patients without HCC (n = 50), group-2: patients with de-novo HCC following DAAs, and achieved sustained virological response (n = 50), and group-3: patients with HCC without DAAs (n = 66). P53 antibody and HGF were determined using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique (Cusabio Co, Houston, USA).Results:Patients with HCC showed significantly higher HGF. Patients with de-novo HCC following DAAs had significantly higher P53 than HCC without DAAs (P Conclusion:P53 may serve as a diagnostic marker for de-novo HCC after DAAs therapy. HGF may serve as a diagnostic marker for HCC but not specific for de-novo HCC after DAAs therapy.
