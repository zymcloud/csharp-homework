Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play the critical biological role in many malignant tumours. MIR4435-2HG has been proven to be a novel oncogenic lncRNA. However, the exact role and mechanism of MIR4435-2HG in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Here, we found that MIR4435-2HG is overexpressed in HCC tissue compared to normal controls and that high level of MIR4435-2HG indicates a poorer prognosis in HCC patients. MIR4435-2HG enhances the growth and metastasis ability of HCC cells. MIR4435-2HG promotes the expression of YWHAZ by sponging miR-22-3p to liberate YWHAZ mRNA transcripts. MIR4435-2HG facilitates the proliferation and metastasis of HCC by modulating the miR-22-3p/YWHAZ axis. These results demonstrated the role and mechanism of MIR4435-2HG in malignant progression of HCC. MIR4435-2HG may be used as the prognostic marker and treatment target for the patient with HCC.
