Background/aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), are small noncoding regulatory RNAs, that function post-transcriptionally. MiRNA deregulation was observed in the development and progression of HCC. In this study we aimed to investigate the expression levels of four miRNA (mir-33a, mir-203b, mir361-3p and mir-424) in HCC patients in comparison to healthy individuals.Materials and methods:Venous blood samples were collected from both HCC patients and healthy individuals. In order to determine relative expression levels of mir-33a, mir-203b, mir361-3p and hsa-mir-424 in HCC patients using probe-based Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) is performed. The cycle threshold (Ct) results were analyzed according to the 2???Ct method and statistical analyses was performed by IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 15.Results:qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression level of mir-33a (fold change: 7.3 and pConclusion:Our results indicated that mir-33a, mir-203b and mir-361-3p, may significantly contribute to tumor pathogenesis in HCC and would have potential to be used as a non-invasive biomarker for cancer therapy.
