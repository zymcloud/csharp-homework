Purpose:To assess the safety, efÔ¨Åcacy and prognostic impact of clinical factors related to lenvatinib treatment in Child-Pugh class A (CP-A) and class B (CP-B) patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC).Methods:Patients with u-HCC who were treated with lenvatinib at multiple centers in Japan were retrospectively analyzed for treatment outcomes according to their respective CP status. Radiological objective response (OR) was assessed using modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) guidelines.Results:Baseline demographic parameters were comparable between 126 (69.6%) patients with CP-A disease and 55 patients (30.4%) with CP-B disease. Frequency of lenvatinib-related adverse events, including decreased appetite (P=0.034), diarrhea (P=0.040), elevated serum bilirubin (P=0.016) and vomiting (P=0.009), were higher in CP-B than in CP-A patients. Relative dose intensity (RDI) was significantly higher in CP-A (0.69) than CP-B patients (0.50, P Conclusion:Lenvatinib treatment offers significant benefits in patients with good liver function in real-world practice. The various characteristics identified in this study might be helpful as clinical predictors of response to lenvatinib and survival in clinical practice. Further studies are required to address eligibility for lenvatinib treatment in CP 7 patients.
