Cedrus atlantica is widely used in herbal medicine. However, the anti-cancer activity of C. atlantica extract (CAt extract) has not been clarified in hepatocellular carcinoma. In the study, we elucidated the anti-hepatoma capacity of CAt extract on HCC in vitro and in vivo. To explore the anti-hepatoma mechanisms of the CAt extract in vitro, HCC and normal cells were treated with the CAt extract, which showed marked inhibitory effects on HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner; in contrast, the CAt extract treatment was less cytotoxic to normal cells. In addition, our results indicate that the CAt extract induced apoptosis via caspase-dependent and independent apoptosis pathways. Furthermore, the CAt extract inhibited HCC tumor cell growth by restraining cell cycle progression, and it reduced the signaling of the AKT, ERK1/2, and p38 pathways. In the xenograft model, the CAt extract suppressed HCC tumor cell growth and prolonged lifespan by inhibiting PCNA protein expression, repressing part of the VEGF-induced autocrine pathway, and triggering strong expression of cleaved caspase-3, which contributed to cell apoptosis. Moreover, the CAt extract did not induce any obvious changes in pathological morphology or body weight, suggesting it had no toxicity. CAt extract exerted anti-tumor effects on HCC in vitro and in vivo. Thus, CAt extract could be used as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic agent against HCC.
