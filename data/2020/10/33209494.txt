Background:The oncogenic role of excision repair cross-complementation group 6-like (ERCC6L) has been revealed in several cancers recently, but little is known about its expression and function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Utilizing public data from Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, ERCC6L dysregulation in HCC and its clinical significance were determined by t-test and Chi-square test. Comprehensive survival analyses (such as nomogram, Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier analysis) were performed to assess prognostic value of ERCC6L for HCC patients. Integrated bioinformatics analyses [including copy number alterations (CNA), DNA methylation, miRNA prediction and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)] were conducted to explore the mechanisms and biological roles underlying ERCC6L dysregulation in HCC.Results:ERCC6L upregulation was identified in HCC tissues compared to normal controls (PConclusions:ERCC6L may serve as a promising prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for HCC patients.
