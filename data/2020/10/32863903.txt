Reliable biomarkers for the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rare, and novel biomarkers are required for the appropriate management of HCC. 5'-Nucleotidase domain containing 2 (NT5DC2) acts as an oncogene in various tumors, but its functions as a biomarker have not been confirmed. Therefore, the present study aimed to resolve these functions by analyzing the prognostic value of NT5DC2 in patients with HCC. A tissue microarray (TMA) was prepared and NT5DC2 expression was measured via IHC staining in TMA dots. The liver cancer (LIHC) cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was enrolled as a secondary cohort. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox regression models were used for assessment of the prognostic value of NT5DC2. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed in TCGA LIHC cohort. A total of 134 patients with HCC were retrospectively enrolled in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital cohort and clinical data were collected. A total of 359 patients with HCC in TCGA were enrolled as TCGA cohort. NT5DC2 was used as an indicator of overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in multiple cohorts. In the multivariate Cox regression model, NT5DC2 upregulation was an independent prognostic factor of OS in both cohorts. GSEA indicated the enrichment of a series of survival- and metastasis-related gene-sets, such as LEE_LIVER_CANCER_SURVIVAL_UP and LIAO_METASTASIS. Collectively, it was suggested that NT5DC2 upregulation was associated with poor OS and RFS in HCC, and was a potential predictive marker for HCC stratification.
