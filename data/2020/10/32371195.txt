Damage-associated molecular patterns are signalling molecules involved in inflammatory responses and restoration of homeostasis. Chronic release of these molecules can also promote inflammation in the context of liver disease. Herein, we provide a comprehensive summary of the role of damage-associated molecular patterns as danger signals in liver injury. We consider the role of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species as inducers of damage-associated molecular patterns, as well as how specific damage-associated molecular patterns participate in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases such as alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis and liver cancer. In addition, we discuss the role of damage-associated molecular patterns in ischaemia reperfusion injury and liver transplantation and highlight current studies in which blockade of specific damage-associated molecular patterns has proven beneficial in humans and mice.
