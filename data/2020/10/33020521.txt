Natural products have been recognized as important bioactive compounds on the basis of their wide biological properties. Here we investigated the antitumor effect and molecular mechanisms of the diterpene Fruticuline A (fruti) from Salvia lachnostachys, in human cancer cell lineages and Solid Ehrlich Carcinoma in mice. Fruti reduced MCF-7 and HepG2 proliferation by the reduction of Cyclin D1 levels and decreased NF-κB gene levels in both cell types. Furthermore, fruti also induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells, reduced Bcl-2 gene expression and induced necroptosis by increasing Ripk in MCF-7 cells. In mice, fruti prevented tumor development and reduced Cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and Rela gene levels, and reduced the p-NF-κB/NF-κB ratio in tumor tissue. Furthermore, fruti induced necrosis and apoptosis, increased N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and TNF-α levels and reduced IL-10 and Vegf levels in tumor tissue. Collectively, fruti exerts antitumor effects through the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, reducing Cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 levels. In vitro the apoptosis and necroptosis pathways are involved in the cellular death, whereas in vivo, cells undergo necrosis by increased tumor inflammation and reduction of angiogenesis. Thus, fruticuline A acts in tumor cells by multiple mechanisms and represents a promising molecule for drug development in cancer treatment.
