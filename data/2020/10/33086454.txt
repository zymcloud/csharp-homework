Objective: To investigate the effect of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain on the proliferation and division of liver cancer HepG2 cells, and to explore the anticancer mechanism. Methods: HepG2 cells were exposed with different concentrations of ouabain (0.1, 1, 10 μmol/L) for 24 h, the proliferation ability was appraised using CCK-8, and the HepG2 cells was as a control group. The status of chromosome separation was detected with cell immunofluorescence (ICC) coupled to confocal microscope. The expression levels of AURKA, mTOR, p-mTOR, ERK and p-ERK protein were analyzed using western blot. Results: After treating with 0.1, 1 and 10 μmol/L of ouabain for 24 h, the inhibitory rate of cells were (23.5±4.57)%, (49.80±5.32)%, and (72.10±5.62)%, respectively. Ouabain could significantly inhibit the proliferation of HepG2, and presented in a dose-dependent manner(F=32.8, P<0.05). The ICC results showed that the chromosome separation disorders occurred in HepG2 cells treated with 1 μmol/L for 24 h, and the spindle diameter of HepG2 cells with ouabain treatment was decreased significantly compared with the control group(t=9.58, P<0.05). The results of western blot showed that the expression levels of AURKA, p-mTOR and p-ERK expressions in HepG2 cells treated with 1 μmol/L of ouabain were significantly decreased compared with the control group(F=16.26, 8.32, 33.59, P<0.05). Ouabain inhibited the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in nude mice(F=370.20, P<0.05). Conclusion: Ouabain can induce chromosome division disorder and inhibit the proliferation in liver cancer HepG2 cells by inhibiting AURKA signaling pathway.
