Objective: To investigate the value of two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D SWE) combined with clinical biochemical data in predicting posthepatoectomy liver failure (PHLF) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 274 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy in Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University from January 2015 to January 2016 were retrospectively collected, including 235 males and 39 females, age 19-80 (56±11) years. All patients were confirmed to be HCC by postoperative pathology. The preoperative 2D SWE examination, laboratory examination results and intraoperative indicators were analyzed. According to the occurrence of PHLF after surgery, single factor analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed on the above indicators to obtain a binary logistic regression model, and evaluate the diagnostic effect of the model on PHLF. In addition, 103 HCC patients from October 2019 to January 2020 were retrospectively collected as an external validation set, including 89 males and 14 females, age 23-80 (55±11) years old. Results: The liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained from 2D SWE, INR and Laminin (LN) were independent predictors of PHLF. The formula of prediction model PM=-15.451+0.095×LSM+11.7×INR+0.012×LN was obtained by combining above three factors. The area under the curve (AUC) of PHLF was 0.82, which was higher than that of end-stage liver disease model (MELD) score and Child-Pugh grading diagnosis of PHLF. The AUC of PHLF predicted by PM in the external validation group was 0.81. Conclusion: 2D SWE is helpful for clinicians to evaluate liver reserve function preoperatively and to predict the occurrence of PHLF in patients with HCC.
