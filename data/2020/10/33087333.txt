Purpose:We assessed the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab (an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) plus apatinib (a vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGFR]-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:This non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study enrolled patients with advanced HCC who were treatment-naive or refractory/intolerant to first-line targeted therapy. Patients received intravenous camrelizumab 200 mg (for bodyweight ≥50 kg) or 3 mg/kg (for bodyweight Results:Seventy patients in the first-line setting and 120 patients in the second-line setting were enrolled. As of January 10, 2020, the ORR was 34.3% (24/70, 95% CI 23.3-46.6) in the first-line and 22.5% (27/120, 95% CI 15.4-31.0) in the second-line cohort per IRC. Median progression-free survival in both cohorts was 5.7 months (95% CI 5.4-7.4) and 5.5 months (95% CI 3.7-5.6), respectively. The 12-month survival rate was 74.7% (95% CI 62.5-83.5) and 68.2% (95% CI 59.0-75.7), respectively. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 147 (77.4%) of 190 patients, with the most common being hypertension (34.2%). Serious TRAEs occurred in 55 (28.9%) patients. Two (1.1%) treatment-related deaths occurred.Conclusion:Camrelizumab combined with apatinib showed promising efficacy and manageable safety in patients with advanced HCC in both the first-line and second-line setting. It might represent a novel treatment option for these patients.
