Objectives:To identify the prognostic value of aberrantly methylated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to explore the underlying mechanisms of tumorigenesis.Methods:Gene expression profiles (GSE65372 and GSE37988) were analyzed using GEO2R to obtain aberrantly methylated DEGs. Functional enrichment analysis of screened genes was performed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Cytoscape software was used to analyze the PPI network and to select hub genes. Transcriptional and proteinic expression data of hub genes were obtained through UALCAN and the Human Protein Reference Database. Finally, we analyzed the prognostic value of hub genes with the Kaplan-Meier Plotter and MethSurv database.Results:In total, 24 up-hypomethylated oncogenes and 37 down-hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) were identified, and 8 hub genes, including 4 up-hypomethylated oncogenes (CDC5L, MERTK, RHOA and YBX1) and 4 down-hypermethylated TSGs (BCR, DFFA, SCUBE2 and TP63), were selected by PPI. Higher expression of methylated CDC5L-cg05671347, MERTK-cg08279316, RHOA-cg05657651 and YBX1-cg16306148, and lower expression of methylated BCR-cg25410636, DFFA-cg20696875, SCUBE2-cg19000089 and TP63-cg06520450, were associated with better overall survival (OS) in HCC patients. Multivariate analysis also showed they were independent prognostic factors for OS of HCC patients.Conclusions:In summary, different expression of methylated genes above mentioned were associated with better prognosis in HCC patients. Altering the methylation status of these genes may be a therapeutic target for HCC, but it should be further evaluated in clinical studies.
