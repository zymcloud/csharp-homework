Background:Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) regulates multiple biological processes and has been found to be related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, common signaling pathways downstream after TAZ knockdown may also be important.Methods:TAZ was knocked down in an HCC cell line, and its potential target genes were analyzed. A decrease in the expression of zinc finger and SCAN domain-containing protein 31 (ZSCAN31) was observed. The difference in ZSCAN31 expression was evaluated, and its effect on survival in HCC patients who received surgical resection was determined.Results:ZSCAN31 was over-expressed in HCC tissues and was associated with low overall survival (OS) in HCC patients after surgical resection. Analysis of tissue samples from 83 HCC patients who underwent surgical resection in our hospital produced similar results. High ZSCAN31 expression was significantly associated with tumor size. High expression levels of both TAZ and ZSCAN31 were related to poor OS. A positive correlation was identified between ZSCAN31 expression and TAZ expression, and the protein binding of ZSCAN31 and TAZ was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay using an HCC cell line.Conclusions:ZSCAN31 is associated with TAZ expression in HCC cells, and the targeting of ZSCAN31 and TAZ may represent a novel therapeutic approach in HCC.
