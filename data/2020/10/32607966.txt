Recurrence and adverse events after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment occur frequently even treated with the most efficient therapy for HCC, liver transplantation. Therefore, better understanding of HCC progression is required to advance the therapeutic strategy of HCC. This study aims to explore the effect and mechanism of small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) on HCC cell invasion and migration. SNHG14 and miR-656-3p expression in HCC tissues and cells were examined by qRT-PCR. After co-transfection with sh-SNHG14, miR-656-3p inhibitor, miR-656-3p mimic, si-SIRT5, pcDNA3.1-SIRT5 and corresponding negative controls, HepG2 and MHCC97H cell proliferation, invasion and migration were detected. Then the expression levels of SNHG14, miR-656-3p and SIRT5 were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Luciferases reporter gene assay and RNA pull down identified the relation between SNHG14 and miR-656-3p and between miR-656-3p and SIRT5. SNHG14 was upregulated and miR-656-3p was downregulated in HCC cells. Inhibition of SNHG14 could inhibit HepG2 and MHCC97H cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Upregulation of miR-656-3p or knockdown of SIRT5 significantly suppressed the biological process of HepG2 and MHCC97H cells. SNHG14 directly acted on miR-656-3p and SIRT5 was a target gene of miR-656-3p. miR-656-3p inhibitor or pcDNA3.1-SIRT5 could reverse the inhibition of sh-SNHG14 on cell proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC cells. SNHG14 promotes HCC cell invasion and migration through regulating miR-656-3p/SIRT5 axis.
