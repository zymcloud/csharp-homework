Increasing evidence has shown that abnormal expression of XPO5 is found in many human cancers and acts as an oncoprotein in certain cancers. However, its functional role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unexplored. In our study, we found that XPO5 was highly expressed in HCC, which was associated with SUMO modification. Moreover, we found that XPO5 was SUMOylated by SUMO2 at K125. Functional experiments revealed that XPO5 SUMOylation could promote MHCC97H cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, we found that the nuclear export of pre-miR-3184 was suppressed by SUMOylated XPO5. Moreover, PLCB1 was identified as the common target of miR-3184-5p and miR-3184-3p. The suppressed phenotype induced by miR-3184-5p and miR-3184-3p could be rescued by overexpression of PLCB1. Bioinformatics analysis showed that PLCB1 expression had a negative relationship with HCC patient survival. The inhibitory effects of MHCC97H cells resulted from abnormal XPO5 SUMO modification could be blocked by miR-3184 inhibitor or PLCB1 overexpression. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of XPO5 in HCC, that is, the SUMOylated XPO5 acts as an "oncogenic" role in MHCC97H cells proliferation, migration and invasion by controlling the nuclear-cytoplasm transportation of miR-3184, thus up-regulating PLCB1 expression.
