In recent years, natural products have increasingly attracted more attention because of their potential anticancer activity and low intrinsic toxicity. Hispidulin is a natural flavonoid with a wide range of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiplatelet, anticonvulsant, anti-osteoporotic, and notably anticancer activities. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that hispidulin, as a potential anticancer drug, affects cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Moreover, hispidulin exhibits synergistic anti-tumor effects when combined with some common clinical anticancer drugs (e.g., gemcitabine, 5-fluoroucil, sunitinib, temozolomide, and TRAIL). The combination of hispidulin and chemotherapeutic drugs reduces the efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs, enhances the chemosensitivity of cancer cells, and reverses drug resistance. Herein, we outlined the anticancer effects of hispidulin in various cancers and its intracellular molecular targets and related mechanisms of its anticancer activity. Based on the available literature, it can be established that hispidulin has significant potential to become an important complementary medicine for cancer prevention and treatment. However, more in-depth in vitro and in vivo studies should be conducted to support its translation from bench to bedside.
