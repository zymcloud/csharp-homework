Background:Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with little or no coding ability has shown a variety of biological functions in cancer, including epigenetic regulation, DNA damage, regulation of microRNAs, and participation in signal transduction pathways. LncRNA can be used as an oncogene and tumor suppressor gene through transcriptional regulation in cancer. For example, the over-expressed lncRNA DLEU2 promotes the occurrence of laryngeal cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, etc. and inhibits the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Deleted in Lymphocytic Leukemia 2 (DLEU2), as one of the long non-coding RNA, was first found in chronic lymphoblastic leukemia and drawn into the progress of innumerable cancers. The molecular mechanism of DLEU2 in multiple tumors will be revealed.Methods:In this review, current studies on the biological functions and mechanisms of DLEU2 in tumors are summarized and analyzed; related researches are systematically retrieved and collected through PubMed.Results:DLEU2, a novel cancer-related lncRNA, has been demonstrated to be abnormally expressed in various malignant tumors, including leukemia, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, pharynx and throat cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, breast cancer, osteosarcoma. Besides, lncRNA DLEU2 has been shown to be involved in the process of proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of cancer cells.Conclusion:Due to the biological functions and mechanisms involved in DLEU2, it may represent an available biomarker or potential therapeutic target in a variety of malignant tumors.
