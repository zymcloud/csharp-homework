Background:This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of the 5-5-500 rule in patients after hepatic resection for the intermediate stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification [BCLC] B).Methods:177 patients had hepatic resection for BCLC-B HCC. The 5-5-500 rule was defined by tumor size ≤5 cm in diameter, tumor number ≤5, and α-fetoprotein ≤500 ng/mL.Results:The 3-, 5-, and 7-year recurrence-free survival rates were 22%, 14%, and 11% in patients within the 5-5-500 rule, and 16%, 10%, and 10% in patients beyond the 5-5-500 rule, respectively (P = .015). The 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates were 72%, 47%, and 34% in patients within the 5-5-500 rule, and 52%, 31%, and 25% in patients beyond the 5-5-500 rule, respectively (P = .035). Being beyond the 5-5-500 rule and liver cirrhosis were independent prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival. For overall survival, being beyond the 5-5-500 rule, age ≥65 years, Child-Pugh class B, and anti-hepatitis C antibody positive were identified as independent prognostic factors.Conclusions:The 5-5-500 rule could predict prognosis in BCLC-B patients with hepatic resection. Hepatic resection might provide survival benefit for selected patients with BCLC-B HCC within the 5-5-500 rule.
