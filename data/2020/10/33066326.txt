The chemokine chemerin exists as C-terminally processed isoforms whose biological functions are mostly unknown. A highly active human chemerin variant (huChem-157) was protective in experimental hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are central mediators of hepatic fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis and express the chemerin receptors chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) and G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1). Here we aimed to analyse the effect of chemerin isoforms on the viability, proliferation and secretome of the human HSC cell line LX-2. Therefore, huChem-157, 156 and 155 were over-expressed in LX-2 cells, which have low endogenous chemerin levels. HuChem-157 produced in LX-2 cells activated CMKLR1 and GPR1, and huChem-156 modestly induced GPR1 signaling. HuChem-155 is an inactive chemerin variant. Chemerin isoforms had no effect on cell viability and proliferation. Cellular expression of the fibrotic proteins galectin-3 and alpha-smooth muscle actin was not regulated by any chemerin isoform. HuChem-156 increased IL-6, IL-8 and galectin-3 in cell media. HuChem-157 was ineffective, and accordingly, did not enhance levels of these proteins in media of primary human hepatic stellate cells when added exogenously. These analyses provide evidence that huChem-156 is the biologic active chemerin variant in hepatic stellate cells and acts as a pro-inflammatory factor.
