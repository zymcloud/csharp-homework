Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor worldwide. The present study was aimed to identify potential hub genes involved in the progression of HCC and investigate its clinical and prognostic significance.Method:First, the dataset GSE76427 was used to construct a co-expression network. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to investigate the meaningful module. Then protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were applied to study hub genes correlated with the HCC progression. The hub gene expression and their prognostic correlation were further analyzed by a series of database. Paraffin-embedded HCC tissues obtained by biopsy from 225 patients were subjected to immunohistochemistry.Result:Twelve co-expressed gene modules were identified using WGCNA. The pink module showed a higher correlation with overall survival years (r = 0.69, P = 0.02). Bioinformatics analysis show the real hub gene was PABPC1 and the PABPC1 mRNA expression was higher in HCC tissues compared with normal tissues. GSEA analysis indicated that PABPC1 expression was associated with P53 signaling pathway. High expression of PABPC1 was correlated with TNM stage (P = 0.004) and serum AFP (P = 0.001). High expression of PABPC1 was correlated with worse overall survival for HCC. Multivariate analysis showed that PABPC1 was an independent prognostic factor for HCC (HR = 4.137, 95%CI: 2.454-6.974, P = 0.001).Conclusion:In general, PABPC1 may contribute to the progression of HCC. Moreover, PABPC1 has potential to be used as prognostic markers in HCC.
