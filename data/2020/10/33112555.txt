Objectives:This study aimed to investigate the expression of SOX2, SOX9, p53, and β-catenin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their correlation with clinicopathological parameters of prognostic importance.Materials and methods:Seventy-five patients were enrolled in this study. All patients had full clinical and follow-up data and available paraffin blocks. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed and correlated with clinicopathological factors and patient survival.Results:We detected the positive expression of SOX2, SOX9, p53, and β-catenin in 76%, 50.7%, 50.7%, and 77.9% of HCC specimens respectively. All studied markers showed a significant increase in the expression in tumor tissue specimens compared to non-tumor tissue. Both SOX2 and SOX9 expressions were significantly associated with adverse prognostic factors in HCC. Significant positive correlations were found between SOX2 and SOX9 and both p53 and β-catenin expression (r= 0.528, 0.485 and; r = 0.253, 0.327, respectively; p Conclusions:Our findings might provide an insight into SOX2 and SOX9's role in HCC and suggest that SOX2 might be targeted for HCC therapy.
