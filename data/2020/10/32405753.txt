Objectives:To compare the performance of the quantitative analysis of the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) tumor enhancement in gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA)-enhanced MRI and of dual-tracer 18F-FDG and 18F-fluorocholine (FCH) PET/CT for the prediction of tumor aggressiveness and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This retrospective, IRB approved study included 32 patients with 35 surgically proven HCCs. All patients underwent Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MRI including delayed HBP images, 18F-FDG PET/CT, and (for 29/32 patients) 18F-FCH PET/CT during the 2 months prior to surgery. For each lesion, the lesion-to-liver contrast enhancement ratio (LLCER) on MRI HBP images and the SUVmax tumor-to-liver ratio (SUVT/L) for both tracers were calculated. Their predictive value for aggressive pathological features-including the histological grade and microvascular invasion (MVI)-and RFS were analyzed and compared using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves and Cox regression models, respectively.Results:The AUROCs for the identification of aggressive HCCs on pathology with LLCER, 18F-FDG SUVT/L, and 18F-FCH SUVT/L were 0.92 (95% CI 0.78, 0.98), 0.89 (95% CI 0.74, 0.97; p = 0.70), and 0.64 (95% CI 0.45, 0.80; p = 0.035). At multivariate Cox regression analysis, LLCER was identified as an independent predictor of RFS (HR (95% CI) = 0.91 (0.84, 0.99), p = 0.022). LLCER - 4.72% or less also accurately predicted moderate-poor differentiation grade (Se = 100%, Sp = 92.9%) and MVI (Se = 93.3%, Sp = 60%) and identified patients with poor RFS after surgical resection (p = 0.030).Conclusions:HBP tumor enhancement after Gd-BOPTA injection may help identify aggressive HCC pathological features, and patients with reduced recurrence-free survival after surgical resection.Key points:• In patients with resectable HCC, the quantitative analysis of the HBP tumor enhancement in Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MRI (LLCER) accurately identifies moderately-poorly differentiated and/or MVI-positive HCCs. • After surgical resection for HCC, patients with LLCER - 4.72% or less had significantly poorer recurrence-free survival than patients with LLCER superior to - 4.72%. • Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MRI with delayed HBP images may be suggested as part of pre-surgery workup in patients with resectable HCC.
