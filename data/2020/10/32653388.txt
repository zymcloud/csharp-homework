Background/purpose:Long-term nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy has been shown to improve the survival in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes and factors associated with survival in HBV-related cirrhotic patients receiving long-term NA treatment.Methods:A total of 126 HBV-related cirrhosis patients with long-term NA treatment, including 67 compensated cirrhosis and 59 decompensated cirrhosis, were retrospectively enrolled. The effectiveness of treatment, survival and risk factors of mortality were determined.Results:Patients with decompensated cirrhosis had significantly lower baseline serum HBV DNA levels than compensated cirrhotic patients (4.98 ± 1.91 vs. 5.67 ± 1.26 log10 IU/ml, P = 0.031). The mean follow-up duration was 84 and 42 months in compensated cirrhotic and decompensated cirrhotic patients (P < 0.0001), respectively. The 1, 2 and 3-year cumulative survival rates were significantly higher in compensated cirrhotic patients than those with decompensated cirrhosis (100%, 98.5%, 98.5% vs. 81.2%, 75.6%, 69.5%; P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis for risk factors of mortality in cirrhotic patients showed that older age (hazard ratio: 3.28, 95% CI: 1.25-8.62, P = 0.016) and decompensated cirrhosis (hazard ratio: 8.30, 95% CI: 2.45-28.06, P = 0.0007) were independently associated with liver-related mortality. A total of 31 patients developed HCC during the follow-up. Among them, 70.9% were at the earlier stages of BCLC system, and 83.8% received potentially curative treatment.Conclusion:Antiviral therapy improves liver function of HBV-related cirrhotic patients and provides a better chance of curative treatment in those with HCC development. Decompensated cirrhosis is a risk factor for liver-related mortality in this special clinical setting.
