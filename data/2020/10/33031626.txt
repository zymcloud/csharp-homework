Spartalizumab is a humanized IgG4/κ monoclonal antibody directed against human PD-1. In this phase I study we investigated safety, pharmacokinetics, preliminary antitumor activity, and toxicity of spartalizumab in patients with advanced malignancies. Patients (n=18) with a range of tumor types received spartalizumab intravenously at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation at the discretion of the investigator or patient. Most patients (61%) had received ≥5 prior lines of therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported and, hence, the maximum tolerated dose was ≥10 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetics in Japanese patients aligned with those reported in a global dose-escalation study. The safety profile was consistent with other approved anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies; the most common drug-related adverse events were maculopapular rash (22%), followed by malaise and increased blood alkaline phosphatase (11% each). Partial responses were reported in 2 patients (11%), one with transitional cell carcinoma and the other with hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, this study confirmed the safety of spartalizumab administered at a dose of up to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in Japanese patients with cancers.
