International guidelines recommend the use of ultrasound as a surveillance tool for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis, while the role of serum biomarkers is still debated. We investigated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II) and glypican-3 (GPC-3) diagnostic accuracy for HCC detection and prediction in patients with liver cirrhosis of viral etiology under surveillance. A total of 349 patients (200 cirrhosis and 149 HCC) were enrolled. The 200 patients with cirrhosis consisted of 114 patients still HCC-free after 36 months of follow-up and 86 patients that developed HCC after 13.8 (11.0-19.8) months. AFP, PIVKA-II and GPC-3 were measured in serum samples collected at tumor diagnosis in the 149 patients with HCC, and at the beginning of follow-up in the 200 patients with cirrhosis. The higher performance for HCC detection was observed for PIVKA-II (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.790), followed by AFP (AUC = 0.737) and GPC-3 (AUC = 0.637); the combination of AFP + PIVKA-II improved the diagnostic accuracy to AUC = 0.822. Serum PIVKA-II values, but not AFP and GPC-3, were significantly higher in the 86 cirrhotics that developed HCC compared with the 114 cirrhotics still HCC-free after 36 months of follow-up (p = 0.020). PIVKA-II â‰¥ 55 mAU/mL allowed to identify patients with cirrhosis at higher risk of HCC development (Log-rank test, p < 0.001; adjusted Hazard Ratio = 1.99, p = 0.001). In conclusion, the measurement of PIVKA-II in patients with cirrhosis may be useful to tailor personalized surveillance strategies.
