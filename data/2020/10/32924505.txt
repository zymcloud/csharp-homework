Killing tumor cells with a visualized system is a promising strategy in tumor therapy to achieve minimal side effects and high efficiency. Herein, a theranostic nanomedicine (AuNCs-Pt) is developed based on nanocarrier gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with bifunctions of both NIR-I/NIR-II imaging and glutathione-scavenging abilities. AuNCs-Pt possesses NIR-II imaging capability on a fatal high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) model in the deep abdomen, thus facilitating it to be a promising tool for monitoring platinum transportation. Meanwhile, AuNCs-Pt depletes intracellular glutathione to minimize platinum detoxification, effectively maximizing the chemotherapeutic efficacy of platinum. AuNCs-Pt is used to eradicate the tumor burden in this study on a HGSOC model and a patient-derived tumor xenograft model of hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting great potential for clinical visualized therapy and platinum drug sensitization.
