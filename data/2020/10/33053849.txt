Sirolimus (SRL) has been reported to benefit patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to compare SRL with tacrolimus (TAC) in living-donor LT (LDLT) recipients beyond the Milan criteria. This study was initially designed to enrol 45 recipients who underwent LDLT for HCC beyond the Milan criteria. At 1 month after LT, the patients were randomly assigned to either SRL or TAC-based treatment, with both groups receiving mycophenolate mofetil. The primary outcome was three-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and the secondary outcome was overall survival (OS). A total of 42 patients completed the study. HCC recurrence occurred in 8 of 22 (36.4%) patients in the SRL group and in 5 of 22 (25%) patients in the TAC group. No differences in RFS and OS were found between the two groups in simple comparison. The type of immunosuppressant remained a nonsignificant factor for recurrence in multivariate analysis; however, SRL significantly prolonged OS (TAC hazard ratio: 15 [1.3-172.85], p = 0.03) after adjusting for alpha-fetoprotein and positron emission tomography standardised uptake value ratio (tumour/background liver). In conclusion, SRL does not decrease HCC recurrence but prolongs OS after LDLT for HCC beyond the Milan criteria.
