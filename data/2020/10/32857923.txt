Background:Regular clinic follow-up is a prerequisite for optimal antiviral therapy and surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, adherence to regular follow-up stays low in practice. This study investigated whether regular follow-up is associated with decreased liver cancer mortality in CHB patients.Methods:A nationwide population-based historical cohort study was conducted using customized data from the National Health Insurance Service of Korea. The number of hospital visits every 3-month interval was counted for 2 years from the date of CHB diagnosis. Patients were classified into three follow-up groups: regular (four to eight visits), irregular (one to three visits), and no follow-up. The risk of liver cancer mortality was compared among the groups using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.Results:Of the 414 074 CHB patients, 22.9% had regular follow-up. In multivariable analysis, regular follow-up was independently associated with decreased risk of liver cancer mortality compared to no follow-up (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.63, P 60 years, of low socioeconomic status, disabled, lived in a rural area, had a higher comorbidity rate, or did not have cirrhosis.Conclusions:Regular follow-up at least every 3-6 months is significantly associated with reduced liver cancer mortality in patients with CHB.
