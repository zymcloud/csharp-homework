Purpose:To explore the effect of hydrodissection assisted percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) on the primary technique efficacy (PTE) and local tumor progression (LTP) of subcapsular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).Methods:A retrospective review of 135 patients with 181 hepatic subcapsular HCC and CRLM that underwent MWA with (hydrodissection group) and without the use of hydrodissection (control group). The PTE, cumulative LTP rate, and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups.Results:Amongst the 135 patients with 181 tumors, 60 patients with 72 tumors were in the hydrodissection group and 75 patients with 109 tumors were in the control group. The PTEs were 97.2% and 85.3% in hydrodissection and control groups, respectively (P = 0.019). Multivariate analysis showed that hydrodissection significantly improved the PTE of MWA [odds ratio (OR) 0.147; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.031-0.703; P = 0.016). Among the tumors which achieved complete response at the first (1 month) follow-up, the overall LTP rates were 8.6% (6/70) and 11.8% (11/93) in the hydrodissection and control groups, respectively. The 1- and 2-year cumulative LTP rates were 3.0% and 5.0% for the hydrodissection group and 6.8% and 13.5% in the control group, respectively (P = 0.391). No significant differences were observed in major postoperative complications between the two groups.Conclusion:Hydrodissection-assisted MWA had a significantly higher PTE than MWA alone in hepatic subcapsular HCC and CRLM. Hydrodissection did not significantly impact the cumulative LTP rate or the incidence of postoperative complications.
