Sphingolipids (SLs) are critical components of membrane bilayers that play a crucial role in their physico-chemical properties. Ceramide is the prototype and most studied SL due to its role as a second messenger in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways and cellular processes. Ceramide is a heterogeneous lipid entity determined by the length of the fatty acyl chain linked to its carbon backbone sphingosine, which can be generated either by de novo synthesis from serine and palmitoyl-CoA in the endoplasmic reticulum or via sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis by sphingomyelinases (SMases). Unlike de novo synthesis, SMase-induced SM hydrolysis represents a rapid and transient mechanism of ceramide generation in specific intracellular sites that accounts for the diverse biological effects of ceramide. Several SMases have been described at the molecular level, which exhibit different pH requirements for activity: neutral, acid or alkaline. Among the SMases, the neutral (NSMase) and acid (ASMase) are the best characterized for their contribution to signaling pathways and role in diverse pathologies, including liver diseases. As part of a Special Issue (Phospholipases: From Structure to Biological Function), the present invited review summarizes the physiological functions of NSMase and ASMase and their role in chronic and metabolic liver diseases, of which the most relevant is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and its progression to hepatocellular carcinoma, due to the association with the obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemic. A better understanding of the regulation and role of SMases in liver pathology may offer the opportunity for novel treatments of liver diseases.
