The Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (CEUS LI-RADS) was introduced for classifying suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it cannot be applied to Sonazoid. We assessed the diagnostic usefulness of a modified CEUS LI-RADS for HCC and non-HCC malignancies based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Patients with chronic liver disease at risk for HCC were evaluated retrospectively. Nodules â‰¥1 cm with arterial phase hyperenhancement, no early washout (within 60 s), and contrast defects in the Kupffer phase were classified as LR-5. Nodules showing early washout, contrast defects in the Kupffer phase, and/or rim enhancement were classified as LR-M. A total of 104 nodules in 104 patients (median age: 70.0 years; interquartile range: 54.5-78.0 years; 74 men) were evaluated. The 48 (46.2%) LR-5 lesions included 45 HCCs, 2 high-flow hemangiomas, and 1 adrenal rest tumor. The PPV of LR-5 for HCC was 93.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 82.8-98.7%). The 22 (21.2%) LR-M lesions included 16 non-HCC malignancies and 6 HCCs. The PPV of LR-M for non-HCC malignancies, including six intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, was 100% (95% CI: 69.8-100%). In conclusion, in the modified CEUS LI-RADS for Sonazoid, LR-5 and LR-M are good predictors of HCC and non-HCC malignancies, respectively.
