Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing molecular targeted therapy often experience non-negligible adverse events (AEs). Paradoxically, certain AEs are reportedly associated with a good prognosis. We aimed to identify factors predictive of treatment duration and overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC undergoing lenvatinib therapy. Forty-six consecutive patients with advanced HCC who received lenvatinib therapy from April 2018 to November 2019 were prospectively followed until November 2019. Treatment efficacy was assessed according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors for 2-3 months after therapy initiation. The disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response, partial response, or stable disease. The DCR was 65.2%, with a median survival of 10.2 months. Grade 2/3 hypoalbuminemia resulted in shorter treatment duration. Factors predictive of longer OS were a Child-Pugh score of 5 at baseline and the occurrence of Grade 2/3 hypothyroidism. Conversely, Grade 2/3 hypoalbuminemia was associated with a poorer prognosis. An AE of Grade 2/3 hypothyroidism was associated with a better prognosis in patients receiving lenvatinib treatment for advanced HCC. Continuing anticancer therapy with appropriate thyroid hormone replacement may contribute to longer OS.
