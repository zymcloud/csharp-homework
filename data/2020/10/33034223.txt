Chemical investigation of the lichen Usnea ceratina Arch led to the isolation of five depsidones, including one new compound ceratinalone (1) along with four known compounds bailesidone (2), stictic acid (3), 8'-O-methylstictic acid (4) and 8'-O-ethylstictic acid (5). The structures were determined by analysis of their MS and NMR data as well as by comparison with literature values. Compounds 1 and 4 were evaluated the cytotoxic activity against HeLa (human epithelial carcinoma), NCI-H460 (human lung cancer), HepG2 (liver hepatocellular carcinoma), and MCF-7 (human breast cancer) cell lines, showing the moderate activity.
