Background:Double primary cancers have a low incidence rate, and synchronous hepatocellular carcinoma and gallbladder adenocarcinoma are rarely reported. Here, we report such a case- the 12th case of synchronous double primary cancers featuring HCC and GC, but the first case of neuroendocrine differentiation in the gallbladder.Case presentation:A 77-year-old female was admitted to the hospital complaining of weakness and inappetence for six months. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen indicated an 11 cm space-occupying lesion in the right lobe of the liver. Later, magnetic resonance imaging showed a high possibility of a massive hepatoma, and multiple gallstones were also seen. After transhepatic arterial chemoembolization, a repeat abdominal CT showed obvious local nodular thickening in the gallbladder wall. Finally, resection of the right lobe of the liver and cholecystectomy were performed. During an approximately 2-year follow-up, the patient recovered uneventfully without recurrence or metastasis.Conclusion:The disease in this case is rare and lacked typical radiological features. More precise and advanced diagnostic techniques are needed to obtain a clear diagnosis and refine treatment strategies. The management strategy should always be curative, even in the presence of multiple malignancies.
