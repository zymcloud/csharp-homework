Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare primary liver tumor that typically presents at an advanced stage in early adolescents and adults with no underlying liver disease. Surgical resection is the first-line treatment, and patients who are not surgical candidates face limited treatment options with poor long-term outcomes. Herein we report the first documented, technically successful treatment of FL-HCC with extrahepatic spread using transarterial radioembolization (TARE) in a 16-year-old male patient with surgically unresectable disease. Subsequent imaging revealed tumor necrosis and a 20% reduction in size, and the patient survived 20 months post-treatment, a marked improvement relative to historical data in the literature. Further research should examine the potential role of yttrium-90 TARE in the treatment of FL-HCC patients with metastatic disease.
