Purpose:Sorafenib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and first-line treatment option for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Preliminary evidence indicates proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may affect the absorption of TKIs through decreased gut dissolution. This study aims to evaluate the impact of PPI use on the survival outcomes of advanced HCC patients treated with sorafenib.Methods:The study was a secondary analysis of individual-participant data from the phase III clinical trial NCT00699374. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate the association between baseline PPI use and survival outcomes. Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome with progression-free survival (PFS) secondary.Results:In a cohort of 542 advanced HCC patients initiating sorafenib treatment, 122 were concomitantly using a PPI at baseline. No significant associations between baseline PPI use and OS were identified on univariable (HR [95% CI]; 1.01 [0.80-1.28], P = 0.93) and adjusted (1.10 [0.82-1.41], P = 0.62) analysis. Furthermore, no significant associations between baseline PPI use and PFS were identified on univariable (0.96 [0.76-1.21], P = 0.73) and adjusted (1.11 [0.86-1.44], P = 0.41) analysis.Conclusion:In a large high-quality dataset, PPI use was not observed to compromise the survival outcomes of advanced HCC patients initiated on sorafenib.
