Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide and has a high mortality rate. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been noted to play critical roles in cell growth; cell apoptosis; and metastasis in CRC. This study determined that LOC441461 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues than in adjacent normal mucosa. Pathway enrichment analysis of LOC441461-coexpressed genes revealed that LOC441461 was involved in biological functions related to cancer cell growth and motility. Knockdown of the LOC441461 expression significantly suppressed colon cancer cell growth by impairing cell cycle progression and inducing cell apoptosis. Furthermore, significantly higher LOC441461 expression was discovered in primary colon tumors and metastatic liver tumors than in the corresponding normal mucosa, and LOC441461 knockdown was noted to suppress colon cancer cell motility. Knockdown of LOC441461 expression suppressed the phosphorylation of MLC and LIMK1 through the inhibition of RhoA/ROCK signaling. Overall, LOC441461 was discovered to play an oncogenic role in CRC cell growth and motility through RhoA/ROCK signaling. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of lncRNAs and their application in the treatment of colon cancer.
