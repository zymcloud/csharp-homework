The group A scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain is a conserved module present in numerous proteins involved in diverse biological processes. Hepsin, a hepatic protease implicated in many cancers, consists of a cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain and an extracellular regions with a group A SRCR domain and a serine protease domain. Like in many SRCR-containing proteins, the SRCR domain in hepsin has an N-glycosylation site, but its functional significance is unknown. In this study, we confirmed N-glycosylation at Asn112 in hepsin by glycosidase digestion and site-directed mutagenesis in human hepatoma cells. In Western blotting, fluorogenic substrate assay, flow cytometry, and protein-chase experiments, we found that Asn112 to Gln (N112Q) mutation inhibited hepsin intracellular trafficking, cell surface expression, and zymogen activation. By immunofluorescent staining, we found that the N112Q mutant was more abundant than wild-type hepsin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Further co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated increased binding of the N112Q mutant to calnexin and binding-immunoglobulin protein (BiP), two ER chaperones. Our results indicate that the N-glycan in the SRCR domain of hepsin promotes intracellular trafficking and cell surface expression, possibly by a calnexin-dependent mechanism in facilitating ER exiting.
