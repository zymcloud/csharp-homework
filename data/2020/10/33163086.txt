Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor without effective therapeutic drugs for most patients in advanced stages. Scutellariae Radix (SR) is a well-known anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic herbal medicine. However, the mechanism of SR against HCC remains to be clarified. In the present study, network pharmacology was utilized to characterize the mechanism of SR on HCC. The active components of SR and their targets were collected from the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and the traditional Chinese medicine integrated database. HCC-related targets were acquired from the liver cancer databases OncoDB.HCC and Liverome. The gene ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway were analyzed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Component-component target and protein-protein interaction networks were set up. A total of 143 components of SR were identified, and 37 of them were considered as candidate active components. Fifty targets corresponding to 29 components of SR were mapped with targets of HCC. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that SR exerted an antihepatocarcinoma effect by regulating pathways in cancer, hepatitis B, viral carcinogenesis, and PI3K-Akt signaling. The holistic approach of network pharmacology can provide novel insights into the mechanistic study and therapeutic drug development of SR for HCC treatment.
