The precise molecular mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains ambiguous. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 3A (IDH3A) is known as a subunit of the IDH3 heterotetramer. To the best of our knowledge, the biological effect of IDH3A in malignant tumors is unclear. Here, we report that IDH3A is significantly upregulated in HCC tissues; moreover, high expression of IDH3A is strongly associated with tumor size and the clinicopathologic stage of HCC. RNA-seq revealed that depletion of IDH3A affects the expression of metastasis associated 1 (MTA1), an oncogene which is related to the progression of numerous cancer types to the metastasis stage. Cell transfection was used to upregulate and downregulate the expression of IDH3A in HCC cells. The migration activity of HCC cells was assessed using wound healing assays. While transwell assays were carried out to detect the invasion of HCC cells. RNA-seq, RT-qPCR and western blot were used to validate MTA1 as a potential target gene. The present study suggested that IDH3A can upregulate MTA1 expression and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC by inducing MTA1 expression, thereby facilitating cell migration and invasion of HCC cells. Here, we demonstrated the importance of IDH3A in HCC progression. The identification of the IDH3A axis provides novel insight into the pathogenesis of HCC, and the IDH3A axis might represent a novel target for the treatment of HCC.
