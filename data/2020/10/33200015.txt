Angiogenesis plays an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Registered tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor reduce angiogenesis. Apatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can specifically inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, showing encouraging anti-tumor effects in a variety of tumors including advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This article intends to review the clinical research and application prospects of apatinib in the field of HCC.
