Objective: To examine the value of serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-Ⅱ (PIVKA-Ⅱ) detection in the early diagnosis and surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The clinical data of 215 patients with HCC admitted to Department of Hepatobiliary-Pancreatic Surgery of China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University from October 2017 to May 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 172 males and 43 females, aged of (59.0±9.3) years old (range 34 to 86 years old). In addition, there were 85 non HCC patients were enrolled in the control group, 42 males and 43 females, aged (54.2±11.3) years old (range 22 to 80 years old). The blood sample of 3 ml was drawn from the elbow vein at 6∶00 am on the next day of admission, and then was kept in low temperature away from light, and sent for PIVKA-Ⅱ detection on the same day. The positive value of AFP was ≥20 μg/L and PIVKA-Ⅱ was ≥32 AU/L. The data were analyzed statistically by χ(2) test, t test or rank sum test. The correlation between AFP, PIVKA-Ⅱ and tumor maximum diameter was analyzed by linear regression. Results: The sensitivity of PIVKA-Ⅱ detection only for the diagnosis of HCC in all stages was significantly higher than AFP or equivalent to AFP, the overall sensitivity of PIVKA-Ⅱ and AFP was 85.1% and 52.1%, respectively. But the specificity of PIVKA-Ⅱ was lower than that of AFP, they were 78.8% and 96.5%, respectively. In particularly, in the earlier stage of HCC (Ⅰa) , the sensitivity of PIVAK-Ⅱ to HCC was 64.5%, while the AFP was only 26.3%. Combined detection of PIVKA-Ⅱ and AFP significantly improved the diagnostic rate of HCC to 88.4%, and the specificity to 76.5%. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between PIVKA-Ⅱ level and the maximum tumor diameter (r(2)=0.587, P<0.05), but there was no correlation between the AFP level and the maximum tumor diameter (r(2)=0.296, P>0.05). The positive rate of PIVKA-Ⅱ in the diagnosis of HCC with vascular invasion was also significantly higher than that of AFP (P<0.01) . Conclusions: PIVKA-Ⅱ can be used as a serological marker for HCC screening and diagnosis. In particular, PIVKA-Ⅱ detection was significantly sensitive than AFP in the earlier stage of HCC. Combined detection of PIVKA-Ⅱ and AFP can effectively improve the diagnostic rate of HCC in all stages. The significant elevation of PIVKA-Ⅱ is also helpful to determine the tumor aggressiveness, vascular invasion and prognosis of HCC patients.
