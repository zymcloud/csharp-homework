We recently read with great interest the article by Choi et al.,(1) which reported the protective effect of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) when compared with entecavir (ETV) among patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We firmly believe this is an interesting and meaningful study. Given the high recurrence rate of HBV-related HCC after surgery and the poor prognosis of these patients, this result may have considerable clinical significance for improving outcomes.
