Background & aims:Sarcopenia is associated with a higher rate of complications and is an independent predictor of poor outcomes in cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between sarcopenia and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with cirrhosis.Methods:Four hundred and ninety-two patients with cirrhosis and no evidence of HCC from 2008 to 2017 were enrolled, who had baseline abdominal computed tomography (CT) analyzed for identification of sarcopenia according to the previously established sex-specific cutoffs. The main endpoint of follow-up was the occurrence of HCC.Results:The majority of patients were male (365/492, 74.2%), and sarcopenia were present in 238 (48.4%) patients at baseline. During a median follow-up of 3.6 years, 54 (11.0%) patients developed HCC. The cumulative incidence of HCC was significantly higher in male patients with sarcopenia than those without sarcopenia (P = 0.001), but not in female patients (P = 0.26). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that sarcopenia (hazard ratio [HR], 2.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-4.74) was a significant independent factor for HCC development in male patients with cirrhosis, which was consistently identified through competing-risk analysis (subdistribution HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.02-4.72). After propensity score matching, male cirrhotic patients with sarcopenia still had a higher risk of HCC than those without sarcopenia (P = 0.02).Conclusion:Sarcopenia is associated with an increased risk of developing HCC among male patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, nutritional assessment and necessary interventions in specific cirrhotic patients need to be valued.
