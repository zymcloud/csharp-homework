Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the diseases with high mortality worldwide, so its early diagnosis and treatment have attracted much attention. Due to the advantages of the high sensitivity of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection, SERS has excellent application value in the diagnosis of HCC. In this paper, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are modified by magnetron sputtering on the surface of polystyrene (PS) templates with spheres of two different diameters. The array of units surrounded by particles is successfully prepared and the SERS performance is characterized. The effect of the gap between AgNPs on plasmon coupling and hot spot distribution is discussed. Finite-difference time domain (FDTD) simulation is used to verify the electric fields and hot spot distribution of the array. The differences in the concentrations of HCC markers are analyzed by using the change of SERS signal intensity of the array. The whole process proves that the preparation of structures with a strong local electric field to provide highly sensitive SERS signals is a key link in the detection of HCC markers, which is conducive to the diagnosis of HCC and has potential application value in clinical diagnosis.
