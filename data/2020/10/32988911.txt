Aim:Our aim was to confirm the utility of Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging for intraoperative detection of adrenal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis.Case report:An 83-year-old man with a right adrenal HCC metastasis was admitted after complete remission of primary HCC and a metachronous left adrenal metastasis. He was treated with ICG fluorescence-guided limited resection to preserve adrenal function. ICG was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, 6 days before the operation. After removal of the entire suspicious metastatic HCC, ICG fluorescence imaging clearly demonstrated two illuminated lesions. The lesions were separately resected using an energy device. Finally, there were no ICG fluorescent lesions which meant residual tumor. Histopathological examination confirmed adrenal metastasis of moderately differentiated HCC in the initial specimen and the additional resected specimens. Three months after the operation, adrenal function was well preserved without recurrence of HCC.Conclusion:ICG fluorescence imaging is essential for complete resection of adrenal HCC metastasis.
