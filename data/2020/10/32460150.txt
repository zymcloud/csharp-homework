Objectives:To evaluate the clinical feasibility of a new T2 weighted sequence to calculate T2 relaxation times (T2RT) of liver lesions using two-dimensional radial turbo spin echo (2DRTSE) and to evaluate this sequence by performing image quality and relaxation time comparison of multiple liver lesions.Materials and methods:This prospective analysis of 2DRTSE sequences (using 22 echoes) was performed in 19 patients with 36 liver lesions. Two radiologists independently obtained T2RTs for liver lesions and scored image quality and image artifacts. Lesions were classified as cyst, hemangioma, solid, or necrotic. T2RT values were compared. Inter-reader agreement was evaluated.Results:The 2DRTSE images were considered good quality with few artifacts by both radiologists. Nineteen patients were included in the study, with a total of 36 liver lesions. Two of the liver lesions were classified as cysts, 7 as hemangiomas, 4 as necrotic lesions, and 23 as solid lesions. The concordance correlation coefficient was 0.996 for the calculated T2RT of each liver lesion between the two readers, indicating good agreement. There was statically significant difference of the calculated T2RT for each lesion type.Conclusion:The 2DRTSE sequence can be performed and provides good T2W image quality and a quantitative T2RT map of the entire abdomen. The liver lesions can be distinguished based on the calculated T2RT using this technique. 2DRTSE could potentially supplant the current T2-weighted imaging sequence with the benefit of quantitative T2RTs.
