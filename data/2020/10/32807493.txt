Currently, more and more studies show that aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) are important driving factors for the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on the TCGA and GEO databases, miR-660-5p was identified as a possible target for HCC in this study.In HCC tissues, miR-660-5pexpressionwasparticularly high, and this was confirmed inHCC cell lines. The upregulatedmiR-660-5p showed correlations with tumor size, tumor number, TNM stage and histological grade. In vitro experimental data, aswellas in vivo evidence showed that miR-660-5p has the ability to significantly enhance the cell proliferation rate, clone formation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenic capacity of HCC cells. YWHAH is validated that targeted by miR-660-5p using dual luciferase reporter assay. Knockdown of YWHAH has been shown to partially reverse the tumor suppressive function of miR-660-5p inhibitor. Furthermore, miR-660-5p/YWHAH axis could activate PI3K/AKT pathway, which promoted EMT and cell cycle processes. In conclusion, this study illustrated the function of miR-660-5p/YWHAH axis in HCC and provided potential targets for treating HCC.
