Ten coumarin-3-formamido derivatives, N-benzyl-coumarin-3-carboxamide (2), N-fluorobenzyl-coumarin-3-carboxamide (3-5), N-methoxybenzyl-coumarin-3-carboxamide (6-8), N-((1-methyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)methyl)-coumarin-3-carboxamide (9), N-(thiophen-2-ylmethyl)-coumarin-3-carboxamide (10), and N-(furan-2-ylmethyl)-coumarin-3-carboxamide (11), were synthesized and characterized. Compound 5 crystallizes in a monoclinic system P21 /c space group with four chemical formulas in a unit cell; molecules of compound 5 are self-assembled into a two-dimensional supramolecular structure by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and C⋯C π stacking. The potential anticancer effects of these compounds on HeLa (cervical carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast), A549 (lung), HepG2 (liver), and human umbilical vein (HUVEC) cells were examined. Compared with compounds 1-8 and 10-11, compound 9 exhibits potent in vitro cytotoxicity against HeLa cells and lower cytotoxicity against normal cells. Therefore, further in-depth investigations of compound 9 were performed. Absorption titration experiments and fluorescence spectroscopy studies suggested that compound 9 binds to DNA through the intercalation mode.
