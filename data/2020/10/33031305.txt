The effect of intraoperative blood transfusion on the immune function and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of intraoperative autologous blood transfusion and allogeneic blood transfusion on immune function and prognosis in surgically treated HCC patients. One hundred fourteen primary hepatic carcinoma patients who would undergo selective operations were divided into two groups, 35 patients in the experimental group received intraoperative autologous blood transfusion and 79 patients in the control group received allogeneic blood transfusion. The amount of serum T lymphocyte subsets, natural killer (NK) cells and immunoglobulin before and after operation, as well as the recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared. Results shown that, there was no significant difference in the level of immunocytes and immunoglobulin between the two groups before treatment (P > .05). At 1 day after surgery, there were significant differences in T lymphocyte, NK cells and immunoglobulin levels before and after transfusion. CD3+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+, and NK cells in autologous transfusion group were significantly higher than those in allogeneic transfusion group (P
