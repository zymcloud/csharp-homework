Objective:DLGAP1-AS2 has been characterized as an oncogenic lncRNA in glioma. Our preliminary microarray analysis revealed the altered expression of DLGAP1-AS2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the role of DLGAP1-AS2 in HCC remains unknown.Method:Expression of DLGAP1-AS2 and miR-154-5p in paired HCC and nontumor tissues from 62 HCC patients was determined by RT-qPCR. The 62 HCC patients were followed up for 5 years to analyze the prognostic value of DLGAP1-AS2 for HCC. DLGAP1-AS2 knockdown and miR-154-5p overexpression was achieved in HCC cells to study the relationship between them. Methylation of miR-154-5p was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR. Cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 assay.Results:DLGAP1-AS2 was upregulated in HCC and predicted poor survival. miR-154-5p was downregulated in HCC and inversely correlated with DLGAP1-AS2. In HCC cells, DLGAP1-AS2 knockdown resulted in the upregulation of miR-154-5p expression and decreased methylation of miR-154-5p gene. Transwell assay showed that DLGAP1-AS2 knockdown and miR-154-5p overexpression inhibited cell invasion and migration, and the combination of LGAP1-AS2 knockdown and miR-154-5p overexpression showed stronger effects.Conclusion:DLGAP1-AS2 knockdown may inhibit HCC cell migration and invasion by regulating miR-154-5p methylation.
