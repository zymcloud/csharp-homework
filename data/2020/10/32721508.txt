Epigenetics plays a vital role in regulating gene expression and determining the specific phenotypes of eukaryotic cells. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important epigenetic regulatory proteins effecting multiple biological functions. Particularly, HDAC6 has become a promising anti-cancer drug target because of its regulation of cell mobility, protein trafficking, degradation of misfolded proteins, cell growth, apoptosis, and metastasis. In this study, we identified one out of six vitamin K3 derivatives, VKT-2, as HDAC6 inhibitor using molecular docking and cell viability assays in HDAC6-overexpressing HuH-7 cancer cells. Microscale thermophoresis and HDAC6 enzymatic assays revealed that VKT-2 bound to HDAC6 and inhibited its function. We further identified its cytotoxic activity. VKT-2 hyperacetylated HDAC6 substrates and disturbed tubulin integrity leading to significant inhibition of tumor migration in both HuH-7 spheroids and U2OS-GFP-Î±-tubulin cells. Moreover, VKT-2 induced autophagic and apoptotic cell death in HuH-7, while aggresome formation was restrained after VKT-2 treatment. A HuH-7 cell-xenograft model in zebrafish larvae provided evidence that VKT-2 inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. To best of our knowledge, it is the first time to demonstrate that vitamin k3 derivatives (VKT-2) inhibits HDAC6 in solid tumor cells. These unique findings suggested that VKT-2 is a promising anti-cancer agent targeting HDAC6.
