Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and dangerous malignant tumors in China, which causes a large number of deaths every year. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) dysfunction contributes to the malignant progression of tumors. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between the biological role of miR-425-5p and malignant progression of HCC. Our results showed that miR-425-5p expression was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and closely related to the poor prognosis of HCC patients. The knockdown of miR-425-5p inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Further, we identified RNF11 as the downstream target gene of miR-425-5p. In addition, the rescue experiments showed that the upregulation of RNF11 could rescue the inhibitory effect of miR-425-5p on HCC. In general, miR-425-5p as an oncogene promotes the malignant development of HCC via RNF11 and serves as a molecular target for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients.
