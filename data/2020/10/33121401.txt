Background:There is increasing evidence that lncRNA, a type of transcript which is over 200 nucleotides in length may serve as oncogenes or suppressor genes are implicated in the pathophysiology of human diseases. In particular, tumorigenesis and progress are closely correlated with its abnormal expression. In addition, it may become a promising target for many oncology biotherapies. Abnormal DLX6-AS1 expression affects different cellular processes such as proliferation, aggression and metastasis. This review aims to probe into the pathophysiological functions and molecular mechanisms of DLX6-AS1 in various cancers.Methods:By retrieving the literature, this review summarizes the biological function and mechanism of LncRNA DLX6- AS1 in tumor occurrence.Results:The lncRNA DLX6-AS1 is a new tumor-related RNA that has recently been found to be aberrantly expressed in a divers cancers, containing pancreatic cancer, osteosarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric carcinoma, glioma, hepatocellular cancer, colorectal carcinoma, renal carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell cancer, ovarian cancer, Ewing sarcoma, cervical cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, neuroblastoma, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, squamous laryngeal cancer and bladder cancer, etc. Meanwhile, it is identified DLX6-AS1 regulates the aggression, translocation and proliferation of diverse cancers.Conclusion:LncRNA DLX6-AS1 may be viable markers in tumors or a potential therapeutic target for multiple tumors.
