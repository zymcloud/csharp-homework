Partial hepatectomy (PH) is the main treatment for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Yet, a significant number of patients undergo recursion of the disease that could be linked to the fate of innate immune cells during the liver regeneration process. In this study, using a murine model, we investigated the impact of PH on HCC development by bioluminescence imaging and flow cytometry. While non-resected mice were able to control and reject orthotopic implanted Hepa1-6 hepatocarcinoma cells, resected liver underwent an increased tumoral proliferation. This phenomenon was associated with a PH-induced reduction in the number of liver-resident macrophages, i.e., Kupffer cells (KC). Using a conditional ablation model, KC were proved to participate in Hepa1-6 rejection. We demonstrated that in the absence of Hepa1-6, PH-induced KC number reduction was dependent on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 3, and caspase-8 activation, whereas interleukin (IL)-6 acted as a KC pro-survival signal. In mice with previous Hepa1-6 encounter, the KC reduction switched toward a TNF-α-RIPK3-caspase-1 activation. Moreover, KC disappearance associated with caspase-1 activity induced the recruitment of monocyte-derived cells that are beneficial for tumor growth, while caspase-8-dependent reduction did not. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of the TNF-α-dependent death pathway induced in liver macrophages following partial hepatectomy in regulating the antitumoral immune responses.
