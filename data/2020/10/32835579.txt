Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a main cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in diverse cancers. LncRNA-UBE2R2-AS1 has been reported to promote apoptosis in glioma cell. However, the expressions, functions, and mechanisms of action of UBE2R2-AS1 in HCC are still unclear. UBE2R2-AS1 is increased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Increased expression of UBE2R2-AS1 is associated with large tumor size, multiple tumor number, advanced TNM stage, and poor survival of HCC patients. Functional experiments showed that knockdown UBE2R2-AS1 inhibited HCC growth and metastasis through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Regarding the mechanism, UBE2R2-AS1/miR-302b/EGFR established the ceRNA network involved in the modulation of cell progression of HCC cells via activation of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Overall, UBE2R2-AS1 may exhibit an oncogenic function in HCC via acting as a sponge for miR-302b to up-regulate EGFR, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target and a prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.
