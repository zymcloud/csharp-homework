Liver metastasis depends on the collagenous microenvironment generated by hepatic sinusoidal cells (SCs). DDR1 is an atypical collagen receptor linked to tumor progression, but whether SCs express DDR1 and its implication in liver metastasis remain unknown. Freshly isolated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), Kupffer cells (KCs), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), that conform the SCs, expressed functional DDR1. HSCs expressed the largest amounts. C26 colon carcinoma secretomes increased DDR1 phosphorylation in HSCs and KCs by collagen I. Inhibition of kinase activity by DDR1-IN-1 or mRNA silencing of DDR1 reduced HSCs secretion of MMP2/9 and chemoattractant and proliferative factors for LSECs and C26 cells. DDR1-IN-1 did not modify MMP2/9 in KCs or LSECs secretomes, but decreased the enhancement of C26 migration and proliferation induced by their secretomes. Gene array showed that DDR1 silencing downregulated HSCs genes for collagens, MMPs, interleukins and chemokines. Silencing of DDR1 before tumor inoculation reduced hepatic C26 metastasis in mice. Silenced livers bore less tumor foci than controls. Metastatic foci in DDR1 silenced mice were smaller and contained an altered stroma with fewer SCs, proliferating cells, collagen and MMPs than foci in control mice. In conclusion, hepatic DDR1 promotes C26 liver metastasis and favors the pro-metastatic response of SCs to the tumor.
