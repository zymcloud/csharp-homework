Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare inflammatory disorder of the liver that may arise at any age, from infancy to adulthood. Long-standing autoimmune hepatitis may progress to cirrhosis and subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the true incidence of HCC in AIH patients is unknown as there is a paucity of published data. Currently, there are no established guidelines on screening patients with AIH for HCC. Without screening protocols, patients with AIH may present with late-stage HCC that may have been detected and treated earlier in the disease course. We describe a case of a patient with type 1 AIH who developed stage IIIB HCC in the absence of appropriate screening protocols with complex social determinants leading to barriers to access regular follow-up care.
