Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is frequently silenced in lung, prostate, liver, stomach, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and other forms of human carcinomas. However, it is unclear regarding the role of CADM1 in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) that is the most common gastrointestinal diagnosis and may contribute to impaired intestinal barrier function. The aim of the present study is to explore the potential mechanism of CADM1 in regulating intestinal barrier function in IBS-D. A rat model with IBS-D induced by the combination method of mother-infant separation, acetic acid and restraint stress was initially established. The defecation frequency, faecal water content (FWC), total intestinal permeability, sIgA, endotoxin, D-lactic acid and diamine oxidase (DAO) were then measured. Next, positive expression of CADM1 protein was detected in distal colonic tissue of rats by immunohistochemistry. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in distal colonic mucosa, CADM1, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), STAT3, p-JAK1, p-STAT3, Claudin-1and Claudin-2 were evaluated using ELISA, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. IBS-D rats exhibited low CADM1 expression and activated STAT3 signaling pathway. Overexpression of CADM1 in rats was shown to increase Claudin-1 expression, while decreasing expression of STAT3, Claudin-2, TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, silencing of CADM1 or inhibition of the STAT3 signaling pathway was demonstrated to improve the intestinal barrier function. Our study provides evidence that CADM1 can potentially improve intestinal barrier function in rats with IBS-D by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway.
