The redox status of cancer cells is well regulated by the balance between the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and elimination. Thus, the overall elevation of ROS level above the cellular tolerability threshold would lead to apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Herein, cinnamaldehyde (CA), a kind of oxidative stress amplified agent, was combined with photosensitizer pheophorbide A (PA) to promote the generation of ROS though synergistically endogenous and exogenous pathways. Firstly, acid-responsive polygalactose-co-polycinnamaldehyde polyprodrug (termed as PGCA) was synthesized, which could self-assemble into stable nanoparticles for the delivery of PA (termed as PGCA@PA NPs). The abundant expression of galactose receptor on tumor cells facilitated the positive targeting and cellular uptake efficiency of PGCA@PA NPs, after which PA could be synchronously released in company with the intracellular disassembly of PGCA NPs, due to the detaching of CA moieties under acidic microenvironment in endo/lysosomal compartment. Significantly increased ROS level was induced by the combined action of CA and PA with light irradiation, resulting in dramatically enhanced apoptosis of cancer cells. Importantly, intravenous injection of PGCA@PA NPs potently inhibited the tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma with negligible adverse effects. Moreover, combined with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy, PGCA@PA NPs treatment elicited anti-melanoma T-cell immune response and significantly promoted T cells infiltration in tumors. Hence, this novel polyprodrug nano delivery system was able to target and modulate the unique redox regulatory mechanisms of cancer cells through endogenous and exogenous pathways, providing a feasible approach to achieve synergetic therapeutic activity and selectivity.
