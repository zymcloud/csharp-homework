When the hepatitis B virus (HBV) enters target cells, there are complex trans-regulatory mechanisms involved in the interactions between the virus and the target cells. In the present study, a new gene screened from the hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 using suppression subtractive hybridization, referred to as lncRNA HBVPTPAP, was used to study the trans-regulation of HBV DNA polymerase. According to the structural characteristics of the full-length sequences, it was classified as long non-coding RNA. However, a unique and complete open reading frame (ORF) was still present. Therefore, to further identify the lncRNA HBVPTPAP gene's encoding potential, this study used several online tools to analyze and verify its encoding polypeptide authenticity. On that basis, the effects of the lncRNA HBVPTPAP gene on the biological behaviors of HepG2 cells and its molecular regulatory mechanism were investigated. It was found that the lncRNA HBVPTPAP subcellular was mainly located in the cytoplasm, and possibly activated the downstream JAK/STAT signaling pathway through the interaction between the encoding polypeptide and PILRA intracellular domain. Then, the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway may have been initiated to induce apoptosis. These results provided a basis for further study of the biological functions of the lncRNA HBVPTPAP gene.
