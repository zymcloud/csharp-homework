The human microbiome is a vast and complex system encompassing all of the microbes and their genes that occupy the environmentally exposed surfaces of the human body. The gut microbiota and its associated microbiome play an integral role in mammalian metabolism and immune tolerance as well as in immunocompetence. Disruptions in the human gut microbiome are associated with a cycle of hepatocyte injury and regeneration characteristic of chronic liver disease. The persistence of this inflammation has been shown to induce the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, the importance and prognostic influence of the gut microbiome on hepatocarcinogenesis has been increasingly studied in recent years. This review discusses the mechanisms by which imbalances in the gut microbiome disturb the gut-liver axis to impact hepatocarcinogenesis, including disruption of the intestinal barrier, changes in bile acid metabolism, and reduction in tumor-suppressing microRNA. Furthermore, this review summarizes recent advances in potential microbiome-based therapeutic opportunities in HCC.
