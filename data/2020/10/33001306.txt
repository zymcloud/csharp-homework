Objectives:To explore the role of preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in stratifying the risk of early recurrence in patients with LR-5 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by LI-RADS v2018 after curative resection.Methods:Between July 2015 and August 2018, this study evaluated consecutive treatment-naïve at-risk LR-5 HCC patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI examination within 2 weeks before curative resection. The Cox regression analysis was performed to identify potential predictors of early recurrence. Disease-free survival (DFS) rates were analyzed and compared by using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests.Results:Fifty-three of 103 (51.5%) patients experienced early recurrence. Three MRI findings were significantly associated with early recurrence: corona enhancement (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.116; p = 0.013), peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) (HR: 2.262; p = 0.007), and satellite nodule (HR: 2.777; p = 0.005). An additional risk factor was AFP level > 400 ng/mL (HR: 1.975; p = 0.016). Based on the number of MRI predictors, LR-5 HCC patients were stratified into three subgroups: LR-5a (60/103; no predictor), LR-5b (26/103; one predictor), and LR-5c (17/103; two or three predictors), with low, medium, and high risk of early recurrence, respectively. The 2-year DFS rate of LR-5a, LR-5b, and LR-5c patients was 65.0%, 38.5%, and 5.9%, respectively, while the corresponding median DFS was undefined, 17.1 months, and 5.1 months, respectively (p Conclusions:In at-risk LR-5 HCC patients, corona enhancement, peritumoral hypointensity on HBP, and satellite nodule could be used to preoperatively stratify the risk of early recurrence after hepatectomy.Key points:• Corona enhancement, peritumoral hypointensity on HBP, satellite nodule, and serum AFP level > 400 ng/mL were significant predictors of early recurrence in patients with LR-5 HCC after hepatectomy. • Based on the number of predictive MRI findings, LR-5 HCC patients could be preoperatively stratified into three subgroups: LR-5a, LR-5b, and LR-5c, with significantly different risk of early recurrence and disease-free survival. • Preoperative risk stratification is essential for the identification of patients at increased risk of postoperative early recurrence, which may contribute to risk-based personalized management for LR-5 HCC patients.
