Maternal exposures during pregnancy affect the onset and progression of adult diseases in the offspring. A prior mouse study indicated that maternal tobacco smoke exposure affects hepatic fibrosis in adult offspring. Gutkha, a broadly used smokeless tobacco (ST) product, is widely used by pregnant woman in many countries. The objective of this murine study was to evaluate whether oral maternal exposure to gutkha during pregnancy alters non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adult offspring: risk factors for the progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis in adults remain elusive. Buccal cavity 'painting' of pregnant mice with gutkha began on gestational days (GD) 2-4 and continued until parturition. Beginning at 12 weeks of age, a subset of offspring were transitioned to a high-fat diet (HFD). Results demonstrated that prenatal exposure to gutkha followed by an HFD in adulthood significantly increased the histologic evidence of fatty liver disease only in adult male offspring. Changes in hepatic fibrosis-related cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6) and in hepatic collagen mRNA expression were observed when comparing adult male offspring exposed to gutkha in utero to those not exposed. These findings indicate that maternal use of gutkha during pregnancy affects NAFLD in adult offspring in a sex-dependent manner.
