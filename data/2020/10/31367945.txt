Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with motor and non-motor impairment. It has been known for a while that oxidative stress, protein changes and mitochondrial dysfunction have the role of contribution to the pathogenesis. Disturbance of red blood cell function may play a role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. RDW was found to be strongly associated with inflammatory markers in diseases such as acute pancreatitis, myocardial injury and hepatocellular carcinoma. The data about RDW levels and PD are scarce. In this study, we aimed to investigate the RDW values and their relationship with the severity of the disease in patients with Parkinson's disease. 94 patients with Parkinson's disease were included into the study, 97 healthy individuals without history of PD were considered as control group. The United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the modified Hoehn and Yahr staging scale were used to assess the severity of PD. Although RDW levels were significantly higher than the healthy subjects, there was not any relation between the severity of PD, duration of the disease, RDW levels, other blood parameters, mean UPDRS score or mean mH&Y score. In conclusion, RDW levels are higher than the healthy subjects in PD patients but there is no relation between RDW levels and disease duration. Larger studies are needed to explain the role of RDW as an inflammatory marker.
