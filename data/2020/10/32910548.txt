Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) can be detected by the immune system; however, it acquires features for evasion of immune surveillance during its origin and development. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical as immune regulators in cancers; nevertheless, the biological functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs in evasion of immune system by LIHC remain unclear. In this study, an integrated and computational approach was developed to identify immune-related lncRNAs and to divide LIHC patients into diverse immune-related risk groups based on the expression profiles of coding genes and lncRNAs. LIHC-specific genes and lncRNAs in 17 immune cell populations were identified and analysed. Gene and lncRNA co-expressing networks for diverse immune cell populations were constructed and analysed. Some imported immune-related lncRNAs, such as MIR9-3HG, were also identified. The LIHC patients comprised three different groups based on immune-related risk. LIHC patients possessing a greater diversity of immune cell populations had better survival prognosis. The collective data are evidence of a credible computational model that can prioritize novel immune-related lncRNAs and depict the atlas of immune-related lncRNAs in LIHC. These findings will further the understanding of lncRNA function and advance the identification of immunotherapy targets in LIHC.
