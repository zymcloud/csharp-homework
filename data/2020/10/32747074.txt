The purpose of this initial clinical observation was to investigate the safety and effect of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Twenty patients who had been treated with SBRT, with 24 local residuals, received HIFU ablation. The changes of periphery blood cell count and serum biochemistry were observed before HIFU and 1 week after. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging before HIFU and 2 weeks after was performed to assess the effect of HIFU. All patients received follow-up. The mean ± standard deviation follow-up time was 19.3 ± 18.0 mo. The median survival time and 1-y survival rate were 21 mo and 76.2%. Seventeen residual lesions (70.8%) received complete ablation and seven received partial ablation, with a mean ablation ratio of 75.8% ± 18.2%. No significant differences were found in periphery blood cell counts or serum biochemistry 1 week after HIFU compared with before HIFU. No severe adverse reactions related to HIFU were observed. Thus, we believe that HIFU can safely and effectively ablate residual HCC after SBRT, which may be a feasible option for patients with HCC who have local residuals after SBRT.
