Aim:Guidance on post-cardiac arrest prognostication is largely based on data from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), despite clear differences between the OHCA and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) populations. Early prediction of mortality after IHCA would be useful to help make decisions about post-arrest care. We evaluated the ability of lactate and need for vasopressors after IHCA to predict hospital mortality.Methods:Single center retrospective observational study of adult IHCA patients who achieved sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), required mechanical ventilation peri-arrest and had a lactate checked within 2 h after ROSC. We evaluated the association of post-ROSC lactate and need for vasopressors with mortality using multivariate logistic regression.Results:A total of 364 patients were included. Patients who received vasopressors within 3 h after ROSC had significantly higher mortality compared to patients who did not receive vasopressors (58% vs. 43%, p = 0.03). Elevated lactate level was associated with mortality (44% if lactate <5 mmol/L, 58% if lactate 5-10 mmol/L, and 73% if lactate >10 mmol/L, p < 0.01). A multivariable model with lactate group and post-ROSC vasopressor use as predictors demonstrated moderate discrimination (AUC 0.64 [95%CI:0.59-0.70]). Including other variables, the most parsimonious model included lactate, age, body mass index, race, and history of arrhythmia, cancer and/or liver disease (AUC 0.70 [95% CI: 0.64-0.75]).Conclusion:Post-ROSC lactate and need for vasopressors may be helpful in stratifying mortality risk in patients requiring mechanical ventilation after IHCA.
