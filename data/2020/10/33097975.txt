Purpose:This study aimed to compare the performance of 68Ga-labelled fibroblast activating protein inhibitor (FAPI) PET and 18F-FDG PET for imaging of hepatic tumours.Methods:We prospectively assessed 20 patients with suspected intrahepatic lesions. Tumour radiological features, pathology, or follow-up examinations were assessed as ground truth in correlation with PET scans. Semiquantitative analysis was additionally performed by measuring the standardised uptake value (SUV). Tumour-to-liver background ratios (TBR) were calculated and compared between 68Ga-FAPI PET and 18F-FDG PET. FAPI expression was assessed by immunochemistry in samples obtained from 7 patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC)/intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) or granulomas.Results:Primary intrahepatic tumours, including 16 HCC in 14 patients and 4 ICC in 3 patients with extrahepatic metastases, were determined by histology (n = 14) and clinical examinations (n = 3). Based on visual analysis, 17 patients presented elevated 68Ga-FAPI uptake (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 100%), while 7 patients presented 18F-FDG avid tumours (sensitivity: 58.8%, specificity: 100%). 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT identified 17 extrahepatic metastases vs. 13 in 18F-FDG PET/CT in 2 ICC patients. Three benign liver nodules in three patients showed negligible uptake in dual-PET scans. The SUVmax_HCC = 8.47 ± 4.06 and TBRmax_HCC = 7.13 ± 5.52, and SUVmax_ICC = 14.14 ± 2.20 TBRmax_ICC = 26.46 ± 4.94 in 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT were significantly higher than the 18F-FDG uptake presenting SUVmax_HCC = 4.86 ± 3.58 and TBRmax_HCC = 2.39 ± 2.21, and SUVmax_ICC = 9.19 ± 3.60 and TBRmax_ICC = 2.39 ± 2.21 (all p values < 0.05). ICC patients showed higher levels of FAPI uptake in the primary hepatic lesions compared to extrahepatic metastases, TBRmax_ICC = 15.18 ± 5.80 (p = 0.04).Conclusions:68Ga-FAPI PET-CT has superior potential in the detection of primary hepatic malignancy compared to 18F-FDG.
