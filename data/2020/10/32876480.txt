The breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) is a tumor suppressor, and mutations or epigenetic inactivation will increase the risk of breast cancer oncogenesis. The current research aimed to explore the relationship between BRCA1 expression, prognosis, and tumor immunity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, BRCA1 expression was analyzed via multiple online databases and its association with clinical characteristics, prognosis and genetic alterations was identified using the original The Cancer Genome Atlas-liver hepatocellular carcinoma cohorts. DNA methylation sites and their prognostic values were analyzed using MethSurv. The correlations between BRCA1 and immune infiltration were investigated via Tumor Immune Estimation Resource. As results, BRCA1 was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues in multiple HCC cohorts. Besides, high BRCA1 expression was correlated with race, advanced T stage, clinical stage, poor tumor grade, MSI status, and worse prognosis. Notably, BRCA1 expression was positively correlated with infiltration levels of B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The current findings imply that BRCA1 is associated with prognosis and immune infiltration, laying foundations for in-depth research on the role of BRCA1 in HCC.
