Sorafenib is currently the gold standard therapy for palliative treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with compensated liver disease. There are few cases reported in literature describing patients with HCC achieving a complete remission (CR) due to Sorafenib therapy. We report the case of a 62-year old patient who obtained CR despite single, long drug discontinuation and kept it without any maintenance therapy. Furthermore, this is the first case describing the onset of a likely IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis and cholangitis during Sorafenib administration. Further studies are required to define the predictors of a good response to Sorafenib and to codify a therapeutic maintenance regimen for patients who achieve CR.
