Although programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade is effective in a subset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its therapeutic response is still unsatisfactory. Alternatively, the potential impact of the lenvatinib in patients who showed tumor progression on PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is unknown. In this work, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib administration after PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade. The outcome and safety of lenvatinib administered after PD-1/PD-L1 blockade failure was analyzed retrospectively in 36 patients. Tumor growth was assessed every 4-8 weeks using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The mean relative dose intensity of lenvatinib was 87.6% and 77.8% in patients receiving a starting dose of 8 (interquartile range (IQR), 77.5-100.0) mg and 12 (IQR, 64.4-100.0) mg, respectively. Since lenvatinib therapy initiation, the median progression-free survival was 10 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.3-11.8) and the median overall survival was 15.8 months (95% CI: 8.5-23.2). The objective response rate was 55.6%, and the disease control rate was 86.1%. No particular safety concerns were observed. Lenvatinib demonstrated considerable antitumor effects with acceptable safety in patients with progressive and unresectable HCC when administered right after PD-1/PD-L1 blockade failure.
