Cancer cells under hypoxic, endoplasmic reticulum, and reactive oxygen species stress secrete copious amounts of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) to promote tumor metastasis. The effects of blocking stress-induced sEV release on tumor metastasis remain unknown. We found that miR-30a-3p was selectively sorted into sEVs by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells under the influence of multiple stressors. miR-30a-3p removal from cancer cells through sEVs promoted HCC cell migration and invasion, whereas exogenous overexpression of miR-30a-3p could inhibit migration, invasion, and sEV release by directly targeting SNAP23. HCC cells efficiently absorbed hepatic stellate cell (HSC) sEVs, providing an advantage in the treatment of HCC using HSC sEVs. Treatment with HSC sEVs rich in miR-30a-3p cargo effectively attenuated HCC migration, invasion, and metastasis. Overall, sEVs containing miR-30a-3p decreased sEV secretion as well as the migration, invasion, and metastasis of HCC by directly targeting SNAP23, thereby providing an effective strategy to attenuate metastasis of HCC.
