Angiogenesis and the activation of AKT/mTOR pathway are crucial for hepatocarcinoma development and progression, the activation of mTORC1/2 and relevant substrates have been confirmed in clinical hepatocarcinoma samples. Therefore, AKT/mTOR pathway represents the major targets for anti-cancer drugs development. Here, we investigated the anti-proliferative activity and mechanisms of ZJQ-24 in hepatocellular carcinoma, both in vivo and in vitro. A hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model showed that ZJQ-24 significantly inhibited tumor growth with few side effects. MTT assays, flow cytometric analysis, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry identified that ZJQ-24 effectively suppressed hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation via G2/M phase arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis but had no cytotoxic on normal cells. Furthermore, ZJQ-24 significantly blocked AKT/mTOR signaling by down-regulation of mTORC1 molecules, including phospho-p70S6K (Thr389) and phospho-4EBP-1 (Ser65, Thr37/46, Thr70) and phospho-AKT (Ser473) in HCC cells. It is very important that the ZJQ-24 did not induce the mTORC1-depdent PI3K/Akt feedback activation through JNK excitation. Moreover, ZJQ-24 inhibited the cap-dependent translation initiation by impairing the assembly of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex. Immunohistochemistry further confirmed ZJQ-24 inhibited the tumor growth through suppression of VEGF and AKT/mTOR pathways in vivo. Thus, the present study is the first to illustrate that ZJQ-24 triggers antiangiogenic activity and apoptosis via inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, providing basic scientific evidence that ZJQ-24 shows great potential function as inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma.
