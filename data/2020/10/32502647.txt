Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with hepatic steatosis, inflammation and liver fibrosis and has become one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of hepatic steatosis and the progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not fully understood. Herein, we discovered that AMPKα2 catalytic subunit showed reduced expression in the liver following high fat diet (HFD) feeding to mice. Importantly, knockout of AMPKα2 in mice aggravated NAFLD, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. On the other hand, hepatocyte-targeted overexpression of AMPKα2 prevented or reversed NAFLD indications. In vivo mechanistic studies revealed that increased phosphorylation of IKKα/β and NF-κB in HFD-fed AMPKα2-/- mice compared to WT mice, and treatment of these mouse cohorts with an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling for 4 weeks, effectively attenuated the progression of steatohepatitis and metabolic disorder features. In summary, AMPKα2 provides a protective role in the process of hepatic steatosis to NASH progression through suppression of liver NF-κB signaling.
