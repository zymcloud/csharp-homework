Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and highly malignant tumor that is prone to recurrence and metastasis and has no effective treatment. Unsurprisingly, its prognosis is quite poor; early detection methods and effective low-toxicity treatments are urgently needed. To achieve these goals, we designed a multifunctional, U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticle (NP) with a porous metal organic frame loaded with sorafenib (SF), conjugated with HCC-specific targeting peptide SP94 and the near-infrared dye cyanine (Cy)5.5. These NPs are amenable to multimodal imaging for dynamic monitoring of their biodistribution and tumor-targeting effects. The SP94-PB-SF-Cy5.5 NPs achieved targeted delivery and controlled SF release and exhibited good photothermal effects. In this strategy, photothermal therapy and SF treatment complement each other, reducing the side effects of SF and achieving a therapeutic effect without local tumor recurrence. In addition, the catalase-like ability of the NPs alleviates tumor hypoxia, and their photothermal effects induce immunogenic cell death, leading to the release of tumor-associated antigens. These effects combine to trigger an antitumor immune response; the NPs also displayed promising inhibitory effects on tumor metastasis and recurrence and produced an abscopal effect and long-term immunological memory when combined with antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy. These safe, multifunctional NPs represent a valuable treatment option for HCC. In addition, this next-generation treatment model may provide some ideas for the management of HCC and other cancers.
