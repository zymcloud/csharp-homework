Lung cancer (LC) is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in the initiation and progression of human cancers, including LC. Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 205 (LINC00205) is identified as a novel lncRNA, which has only been unmasked to be a potential cancer promoter in hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. The biologic function and the molecular mechanism of LINC00205 in LC require to be investigated. In the present study, we observed the elevated expression of LINC00205 in LC tissues and cells through real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Additionally, silencing LINC00205 inhibited LC cell growth and migration, but aggravated cell apoptosis. Moreover, we found that LINC00205 recruited FUS to maintain the mRNA stability of cold shock domain containing E1 (CSDE1) and therefore up-regulated CSDE1 expression in LC. Further, the effects of LINC00205 on LC cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration were all erased by CSDE1 overexpression. These findings demonstrated that LINC00205 facilitates malignant phenotypes in LC by recruiting FUS to stabilize CSDE1, suggesting LINC00205 as a potential target for LC therapy.
