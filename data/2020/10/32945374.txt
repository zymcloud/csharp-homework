Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was the third most common cause of cancer‑associated mortality in China in 2015. Early detection of HCC and hepatic cirrhosis (HC) can serve a crucial role in the prevention and therapeutic intervention of these diseases. Current early detection methods rely on less sensitive imaging modalities compared with the pathological examination. In the present study, a total of 64 patients with HCC, 44 patients with HC and 298 individuals with no evidence of disease (NED) were recruited, and the ability of methylated septin 9 (mSEPT9) in diagnosing HCC and HC was investigated. The overall detection sensitivity of mSEPT9 for HCC and HC was 76.7 and 34.1%, respectively, with a 95.9% specificity (HCC vs. NED). The sensitivity of mSEPT9 for HCC was significantly higher than that of α‑fetoprotein (AFP; χ2 test; 56.7%; P50 years of age exhibited higher sensitivity compared with those
