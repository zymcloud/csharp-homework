P21-activated kinases 6 (PAK6) associated with many fundamental cellular processes in cancer including cell-cell adhesion, migration and apoptosis. Here, we report a novel function of PAK6 in mitosis. Expression of PAK6 peaks in the M phase. Knockdown of PAK6 increases cell number in G2/M and promotes cell proliferation. PAK6 specifically colocalizes with Eg5 in the centrosome. Depletion of PAK6 results in multipolar spindle and a simultaneous upregulation of Eg5. Further, the PAK6 depletion-induced multiple spindle and cell cycle progression is reversed by knockdown of Eg5. These data suggest that PAK6 regulates spindle formation and cell cycle by regulating Eg5 expression. Additionally, expression of PAK6 is upregulated when Eg5 is downregulated or inhibited. Thus, PAK6 and Eg5 negatively inter-regulate each other. Significantly, the effect of PAK6 expression on the outcome of the HCC patients is controlled by Eg5 expression. Inhibition of Eg5 reverses PAK6 depletion-promoted cell invasion. Collectively, our data indicate that the inter-regulation between PAK6 and Eg5 might promote the progression of HCC.
