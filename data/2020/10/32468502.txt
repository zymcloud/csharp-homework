We treated a 66-year-old Japanese male with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC) for multiple (>5) liver tumors (maximum 2.6 cm in size, Child-Pugh B score 7) in September 2018. The patient had a history of psoriasis vulgaris and sorafenib (SOR) was introduced (800 mg/day) because of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) refractoriness. However, psoriasis vulgaris exacerbation and a high fever were observed 2 weeks later, and the patient was admitted, after which improvement of psoriasis vulgaris was obtained with external medicine administration and SOR intake discontinuation. Few reports have noted exacerbation of psoriasis vulgaris caused by SOR treatment.
