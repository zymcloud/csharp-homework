Introduction: This study aimed to develop and validate the combination of radiomic features and clinical characteristics that can predict patient survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Materials and Methods: The prediction model was developed in a primary cohort of 70 patients with HCC and PVTT treated with SBRT, using data acquired between December 2015 and June 2017. The radiomic features were extracted from computed tomography (CT) scans. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model was used to build the model. Multivariate Cox-regression hazard models were created for analyzing survival outcomes and the radiomic features and clinical characteristics were presented with a nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to evaluate the model. Participants were divided into a high-risk group and a low-risk group based on the radiomic features. Results: A total of four radiomic features and six clinical characteristics were extracted for survival analysis. A combination of the radiomic features and clinical characteristics resulted in better performance for the estimation of overall survival (OS) [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.859 (CI: 0.770-0.948)] than that with clinical characteristics alone [AUC = 0.761 (CI: 0.641-0.881)]. These patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the radiomic features. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that a nomogram of combined radiomic features and clinical characteristics can be conveniently used to assess individualized preoperative prediction of OS in patients with HCC with PVTT before SBRT.
