Accumulating evidence suggests that chemokines may play an important role in the formation and mediating of the immune microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this meta-analysis was to explore the differences in blood or tissues chemokines concentrations between HCC patients and controls. Online databases, namely PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library, were systematically searched for relevant articles published on or before 15 January 2020. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of the chemokines concentrations were calculated as group differences between the HCC patients and the controls. Sixty-five studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Altogether they consisted of 26 different chemokines compared between 5828 HCC patients and 4909 controls; and 12 different chemokines receptors compared between 2053 patients and 2285 controls. The results of meta-analysis indicated that concentrations of CCL20, CXCL8 and CXCR4 in the HCC patients were significantly higher than those in the controls (SMD of 6.18, 1.81 and 1.04, respectively). Therefore, higher concentration levels of CCL20, CXCL8 and CXCR4 may indicate the occurrence of HCC Future research should explore the putative mechanisms underlying this linkage. Meanwhile, attempts can be made to replicate the existing findings in prospective cohort populations and explore the cause-and-effect relationships pertaining to this linkage in order to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HCC.
