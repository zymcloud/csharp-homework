In the past decade, there has been remarkable progress in surgical treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on evidence created by epoch-making prospective trials or national registry big data analysis. A head-to-head randomized controlled trial comparing liver resection and local ablation for small oligo HCCs (SURF trial) demonstrated comparable recurrence-free survival provided both modalities are feasible. Survival benefit of liver resection for HCC with vascular invasion was demonstrated by two propensity scored matched analyses based on Japanese national data. Furthermore, expanded HCC criteria for living donor liver transplantation were developed based on Japanese national data, and this "5-5-500 rule" was accepted by the social insurance system in Japan. The recent remarkable progress in promising new anti-HCC agents may open the door for effective neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment in combination with surgery.
