Aims:Intrahepatic progression remains the predominant mode of cancer-related death in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) underscoring the need for effective local therapies. We report our initial experience with liver stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in the management of early to advanced stage HCC at an Australian tertiary liver cancer service.Materials and methods:Patients with liver-confined HCC unsuitable for surgical resection or thermal ablation treated with SBRT between October 2013 and December 2018 were retrospectively evaluated. The primary end point was freedom from local progression. Secondary end points were progression-free survival, disease-specific survival, overall survival and toxicity.Results:Ninety-six patients were treated for 112 lesions (median size 3.8 cm, range 1.5-17 cm). The median follow-up was 13 months (range 3-65). Forty-six patients had received prior local therapies (median 1, range 1-5), 83 (86%) patients had cirrhosis with baseline Child-Pugh scores of A (88%) and B7-8 (12%). Fifty-nine (61%) patients had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0/A disease and 37 (39%) had stage B/C. Macrovascular invasion was present in 20 (21%). The median biologically effective dose (BED10) was 86 and 60 Gy for the BCLC 0/A and B/C cohorts, respectively. Freedom from local progression at 18 months was 94% for BCLC 0/A and 74% for BCLC B/C. Progression-free survival and overall survival at 12 months were 80 and 95% for BCLC 0/A and 40 and 71% for BCLC B/C, respectively. Five patients (7%) with cirrhosis and without disease progression had an increase in Child-Pugh score >1 within 3 months of SBRT, four of whom had intercurrent infections. Clinical toxicities grade â‰¥2 were reported in 20% of patients.Conclusion:SBRT is an effective ablative modality for early stage HCC with low rates of significant toxicity. Lower dose SBRT can provide durable local control for advanced stage HCC. However, out-of-field relapse remains common, providing a rationale to investigate SBRT in combination with other therapies.
