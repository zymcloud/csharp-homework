Introduction:Treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAA) for hepatitis C (HCV) in liver transplant (LTX) recipients is very effective, but some studies showed that the treatment effectiveness might be impaired in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study aimed to evaluate the predictors of DAA treatment failure in LTX recipients.Methods:Liver biopsy was done before the treatment in 107 of the 120 patients included. All patients had an abdominal ultrasound and liver elastography performed before and after the therapy. Blood HCV polymerase chain reaction was done before; during; and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after the treatment.Results:Overall sustained viral response 24 weeks after treatment (SVR24) was 96%. There were 2 patients with HCC at the start of the DAA treatment and 3 cases of HCC recurrence during a 1-year follow-up. Treatment failure was observed in 1/115 (0.9%) patients without HCC and 4/5 (80%) with active HCC (P = .0001). Liver fibrosis and previous interferon treatment had no impact on treatment efficacy. Time to viremia elimination on treatment was shorter in the responder versus nonresponder group (28 vs 58 days, P = .03).Conclusions:HCC is a negative predictor of DAA therapy success in LTX recipients.
