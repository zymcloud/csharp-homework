The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with bile duct tumour thrombus (BDTT) is low, and related studies, especially studies on long-term survival, are uncommon. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics, prognostic factors and postoperative long-term outcomes of BDTT in patients with HCC. The clinicopathological characteristics and postoperative long-term outcomes of patients with HCC both with and without BDTT were compared before and after propensity score matching (PSM). Prognostic risk factors were assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression analyses after PSM. Tumour stages in the BDTT group were significantly higher than those in the group without BDTT (P=0.001). Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were significantly higher in the group without BDTT than in the BDTT group before PSM (P
