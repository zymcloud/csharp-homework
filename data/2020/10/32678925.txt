Aim:It remains unclear how direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments influence hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence and survival in comparison with interferon (IFN).Methods:In total, 338 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and previous HCC treatments who initiated IFN (N = 88, IFN group) or DAA treatment (N = 250, DAA group) from January 2005 to November 2017 at 23 hospitals and achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) were analyzed. Cumulative HCC recurrence and survival rates were compared between the two groups using propensity score (PS) matching.Results:After PS matching, 63 patients were selected for each group. The cumulative HCC recurrence rates at 1 and 3 years were 20.6% and 34.6% in the IFN group and 19.2% and 43.0% in the DAA group, respectively; the difference in cumulative HCC recurrence rates between the two groups was not significant (P = 0.332). No significant differences in HCC recurrence patterns were observed between the two groups. Overall survival rates at 1 and 3 years were 100% and 96.6% in the IFN group and 100% and 96.4% in the DAA group, respectively; the difference in overall survival rates between the two groups was not significant (P = 0.132). No significant differences in HCC recurrence and overall survival rates were observed between the two groups in subgroup analyses of patients receiving curative treatment (liver resection or radiofrequency ablation) for the most recent HCC before HCV treatment.Conclusions:The recurrence rates and patterns of HCC and overall survival rates do not differ between SVR patients receiving IFN and DAA treatments.
