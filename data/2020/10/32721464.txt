Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) was a global liver disease which divided into liver inflammation, fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Abnormal expression levels of some microRNAs (miRNA) family members often lead to ALD and other liver diseases. MicroRNA-708 (miR-708) was known to suppress the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its role in the progression of ALD was not clear. In this study, the expression level of miR-708 was down-regulated in ethanol-induced L0-2 cells. ZEB1 could decrease the PPAR-α expression while increase the SREBP-1 expression. Meanwhile, the expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were up-regulated by ZEB1. Of note, ZEB1 aggravated the apoptotic rate of L0-2 cells induced by ethanol via inhibiting p-AKT and p-mTOR of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. What's more, it was demonstrated that miR-708 family members particularly target ZEB1 3'-UTR regions and can down-regulate the expression level of ZEB1 in L0-2 cells. Sum up, these results indicated that miR-708 might inhibit the liver inflammation and lipid accumulation by targeting ZEB1 via regulating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
