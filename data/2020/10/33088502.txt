Background:An elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and a low aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to ALT ratio (AST/ALT ratio) suggest nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, increasing the risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, eating quickly has been found to be associated with outcomes such as obesity. This study sought to investigate the relationship between eating quickly and an elevated ALT or a low AST/ALT ratio in Japanese middle-aged adults.Methods:The present study included 283,073 adults aged 40-64 years who had annual health checkups in Japan from April 2013 to March 2014. The data of serum parameters and lifestyle factors, including eating speed, were analyzed. An elevated ALT was defined as > 40 U/L, and a low AST/ALT ratio was defined as Results:Significantly increased ORs for an elevated ALT were observed in men (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.41-1.49) and women (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.25-1.43). Moreover, eating quickly significantly increased the ORs for a low AST/ALT ratio in men (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.50-1.56) and women (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.31-1.41). When the analysis was limited to those with ALT â‰¤40 U/L, eating quickly had significantly increased ORs for a low AST/ ALT ratio, regardless of sex.Conclusions:Eating quickly was significantly associated with an elevated ALT and a low AST/ALT ratio. In addition, eating quickly was significantly associated with a low AST/ALT ratio even for those without ALT elevation. This study suggested that modification of eating speed may contribute to reducing the risk for an elevated ALT and a low AST/ALT ratio.
