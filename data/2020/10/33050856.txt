Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, with nearly one million new cases and deaths every year. Owing to the complex pathogenesis, hidden early symptoms, rapidly developing processes and poor prognosis, the morbidity and mortality of HCC are increasing yearly. With the progress being made in modern medicine, the treatment of HCC is no longer limited to traditional methods. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy have emerged to treat advanced and metastatic HCC in recent years. Since Sorafenib is the first molecular targeting drug against angiogenesis, targeted drugs for HCC are continually emerging. Moreover, immunotherapy plays a vital role in clinical trials. In particular, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have received increasing attention in the field of cancer treatment, is a possible research path. Interestingly, these two therapies generally complement each other at some stages of HCC, bringing new hope for patients with advanced HCC. In this paper, we discuss the research progress of targeted therapy and immunotherapy for HCC in recent years, which will provide a reference for the further development of drugs for HCC.
