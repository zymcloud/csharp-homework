Purpose:Intraoperative blood salvage (IBS) with autologous blood transfusion is controversial in liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluated the role of IBS usage in LT for HCC.Methods:In a retrospective cohort study at a single center from 2002 to 2018, the outcomes of LT surgery for HCC were analyzed. Overall survival and disease-free survival of patients who received IBS were compared with those who did not receive IBS. Cancer recurrence, length of hospital stay, post-transplant complications, and blood loss also were evaluated. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate overall mid-term and long-term survival (4 and 6 years, respectively).Results:Of the total 163 patients who underwent LT for HCC in the study period, 156 had complete demographic and clinical data and were included in the study. IBS was used in 122 and not used in 34 patients. Ninety-five (60.9%) patients were men, and the mean patient age was 58.5 Â± 7.6 years. The overall 1-year, 5-year, and 7-year survival in the IBS group was 84.2%, 67.7%, and 56.8% vs. 85.3%, 67.5%, and 67.5% in the non-IBS group (p = 0.77). The 1-year, 5-year, and 7-year disease-free survival in the IBS group was 81.6%, 66.5%, and 55.4% vs. 85.3%, 64.1%, and 64.1% in the non-IBS group (p = 0.74). For patients without complete HCC necrosis (n = 121), the 1-year, 5-year, and 7-year overall survival rates for those who received IBS (n = 95) were 86.2%, 67.7%, and 49.6% vs. 84.6%, 70.0%, and 70.0% for 26 patients without IBS (p = 0.857). For the same patients, the 1-year, 5-year, and 7-year disease-free survival in the IBS group was 84.0%, 66.8%, and 64.0% vs. 88.0%, 72.8%, and 72.8% in the non-IBS group (p = 0.690).Conclusion:IBS does not appear to be associated with worse outcomes in patients undergoing LT for HCC, even in the presence of viable HCC in the explant. There seems to be no reason to contraindicate the use of IBS in LT for HCC.
