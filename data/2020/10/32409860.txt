Objectives:To evaluate the safety and efficacy of balloon-occluded transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (B-TACE) for the treatment of HCC refractory to conventional TACE (C-TACE).Methods:This single-center retrospective analysis included 60 consecutive patients who underwent B-TACE (mean age, 61.4 years; male:female ratio, 4.5:1) for the treatment of residual viable (n = 40) or recurrent HCC (n = 20) refractory to C-TACE between November 2017 and November 2018. Technical success, radiologic response rate (proportion of the patients achieving complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] on first follow-up CT according to m-RECIST), major complication rate, and time to progression (TTP) were evaluated. The TTP of B-TACE was also compared with that of the last C-TACE. Factors associated with achieving CR and TTP were explored.Results:B-TACE resulted in 100% technical success and radiologic response rate (CR in 45 and PR in 15 patients). The major complication rate was 6.7% (4/60). The median TTP after B-TACE was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0-6.9 months). The TTP of B-TACE for treating residual HCC was significantly longer than that of the last C-TACE (median [95% CI], 4.4 [3.2-6.9] vs. 2.7 [2.3-4.4] months; p = 0.013). BCLC stage C (adjusted OR, 4.448; 95% CI, 1.691-11.700; p = 0.002) and multiplicity of HCC (adjusted OR, 2.746; 95% CI, 1.206-6.251; p = 0.016) were significantly associated with tumor progression after B-TACE.Conclusions:B-TACE is safe and effective for the treatment of HCC refractory to C-TACE. BCLC stage C and multiplicity of HCC were independent factors associated with TTP after B-TACE.Key points:• B-TACE for the treatment of HCC refractory to C-TACE showed a 100% radiologic response at first follow-up and a significantly longer TTP than the last C-TACE when treating residual tumor. • The major complication rate after B-TACE was 6.7%. Although AST, ALT, and total bilirubin increase were more profound in B-TACE than in the last C-TACE, these were normalized at the first follow-up. • Tumor size, multiplicity of HCC, and hepatic arterial injury were independent factors associated with achieving a complete response. BCLC stage C and multiplicity of HCC were significantly associated with TTP after B-TACE.
