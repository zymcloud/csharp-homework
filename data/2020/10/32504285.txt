Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a lethal cancer type for both males and females. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the initiation, development and metastasis of cancer. Although several miRNAs have been identified as drivers or suppressors of HCC, the molecular mechanisms of many miRNAs have not been investigated. Currently, we discovered that miR-4270-5p was a significantly downregulated miRNA in HCC. We revealed that miR-4270-5p overexpression inhibited cell proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. The data manifested that miR-4270-5p directly targeted SATB2, a key regulator of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), in HCC cells and reversed the EMT process. The rescue experiments suggested that SATB2 overexpression reversed the biological function of miR-4270-5p in HCC cells. Clinical data indicated that SATB2 expression was negatively correlated with miR-4270-5p levels in HCC patients. Our findings provided potential targets for prognosis and treatment of patients with HCC.
