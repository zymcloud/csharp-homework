The growing use of rare-earth doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) has caused increasing concern about their biosafety. Here, to understand the toxicity of UCNPs and their mechanism in HepG2 cells, we systematically study the cytotoxicity, uptake and elimination behaviors of three types of UCNPs combined multiple cytotoxicity evaluation means with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection. Sodium yttrium fluoride, doped with 18% (molar ratio) ytterbium and 2% erbium (NaYF4: Yb3+, Er3+) was selected as the model UCNPs with two sizes (35 and 55 nm), and the poly(acrylic acid) and polyethylenimine were selected as the representatives of negative and positive surface coating of UCNPs, respectively. UCNPs were found to induce cytotoxicity in time- and dose-dependent manners, which might be mediated by reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative stress. Apoptosis, inflammation, and metabolic process were enhanced after cells exposed to 200 mg/L UCNPs for 48 h. Increase in the protein levels of cleaved caspased-9, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax and decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 suggested that the mitochondria mediated pathway was involved in UCNP-induced apoptosis. With the aid of ICP-MS, it demonstrated that the cytotoxicity was associated with internalized amount of UCNPs, which largely relied on their surface properties rather than size in the tested range. By comparing UCNPs with Y3+ ions, it demonstrated that NPs properties played a nonnegligible role in the cytotoxicity of UCNPs. These findings provide new insights for fundamental understanding of cytotoxicity of UCNPs and may contribute to more rational use of these materials in the future.
