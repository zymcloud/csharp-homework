Increasing evidence in recent years has suggested that microRNA-7 (miR-7) is an important gene implicated in the development of various diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of miR-7 in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is unknown. Herein, we showed that miR-7 deficiency led to exacerbated pathology in ConA-induced murine acute autoimmune liver injury model (ALI), accompanied with hyperactivation state of CD4+ T cells. Depletion of CD4+ T cells reduced the effect of miR-7 deficiency on the pathology of ALI. Interestingly, miR-7 deficiency elevated CD4+ T cell activation, proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. Adoptive cell transfer experiments showed that miR-7def CD4+ T cells could exacerbate the pathology of ALI. Further analysis showed that miR-7 expression was upregulated in activated CD4+ T cells. Importantly, the transcription of pre-miR-7b, major resource of mature miR-7 in CD4+ T cells, was dominantly dependent on transcription factor C/EBPα which binding to core promoter region of miR-7b gene. Global gene analysis showed that MAPK4 was a new target of miR-7 in CD4+ T cells. Finally, the loss of MAPK4 could ameliorate the activation state of CD4+ T cells with or without miR-7 deficiency. Our studies are the first to document the important role of miR-7 in the setting of AIH induced by ConA. Specifically, we provide evidence that the C/EBPα/miR-7 axis negatively controls CD4+ T cell activation and function via MAPK4, thereby orchestrating experimental AIH in mice. Conclusion: These data expand on the important role of miR-7 in liver-related diseases and reveal the value of C/EBPα/miR-7 axis in CD4+ T cell biological function for the pathogenesis of immune-mediated liver diseases.
