The availability of directly acting antivirals (DAA) has revolutionised the management of hepatitis C in low- and middle-income countries such as India. We aimed to determine the spectrum of hepatitis C-related liver disease and the response to treatment using generic DAAs, using retrospective data collected from a cohort of adult patients. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, co-infection with hepatitis B, HIV and those with incomplete data were excluded. A sustained virological response was documented in 101/106 (95.3%) cases; we therefore conclude that DAAs are highly effective in the management of hepatitis C infection across a wide spectrum of clinical presentations.
