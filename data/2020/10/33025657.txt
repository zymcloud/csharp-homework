Liver plays a critical role in metabolism, nutrient storage and detoxification. Emergency signals or appropriate immune response leads to pathological inflammation and breaks the steady state when liver dysfunction appears, which makes body more susceptible to chronic liver infection, autoimmune diseases and tumour. Compelling proof has illustrated the non-redundant importance of C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2), one of G-protein-coupled receptors, in different diseases. Selectively expressed on the surface of cells, CCR2 is involved in various signalling pathways and regulates the migration of cells. Especially, a peculiar role of CCR2 has been identified within decades in the onset and progression of hepatic diseases, which led to particular focusing on CCR2 as a new therapeutic and diagnostic target for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review, we discuss the effect of CCR2 in monocytes/macrophages on liver diseases. The application and translation of the decades of discoveries into therapies promise novel approaches in the treatment of liver disease.
