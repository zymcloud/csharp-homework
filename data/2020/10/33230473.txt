Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most aggressive malignancies, ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Emerging evidence indicates that RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays a critical role in tumor progression. However, the biological function of YTHDF1 in HCC remains unclear. Here, we found that YTHDF1 expression was strikingly elevated in HCC tissues and cell lines and significantly associated with prognosis of HCC patients. Moreover, YTHDF1 expression was transcriptionally regulated by USF1 and c-MYC in HCC. Functional studies showed that YTHDF1 can promote HCC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Multi-omics analysis revealed that YTHDF1 can accelerate the translational output of FZD5 mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner and function as an oncogene through the WNT/Î²-catenin pathway. Taken together, our study revealed an essential role of YTHDF1 in the progression of HCC cells, which indicated that targeting YTHDF1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy in HCC.
