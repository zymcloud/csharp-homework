Liposomes have been widely used as drug carriers in both biomedical research and for clinical applications, allowing the stabilisation of therapeutic compounds and overcoming obstacles to cellular and tissue uptake. However, liposomes still have low targeting efficiency, resulting in insufficient killing of tumour cells and unnecessary damage to normal cells. In this study, glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA) were used as ligands to prepare dual-ligand-modified doxorubicin-loaded liposomes (DOX-GA/PNA-Lips) to enhance the targeting accuracy and efficacy of drug delivery against malignant liver cancer. PNA and GA modification enhanced the binding ability of liposomes to liver cancer cells, leading to excellent tissue and cell targeting of DOX-GA/PNA-Lips. DOX-GA/PNA-Lips showed an effective anti-tumour effect in vivo and in vitro, with its targeted delivery facilitating attenuation of the toxic side effects of DOX. These results demonstrated that dual-ligand-modified liposomes may provide an effective strategy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
