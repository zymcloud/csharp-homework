Brg1 and Hippo signalling pathway are abnormally expressed in many malignant tumours, especially in Hepatocellular carcinoma, but their role in liver regeneration (LR) is unknown. In our research, we investigated the role of Brg1 and Hippo signalling pathway in hepatocyte proliferation and LR. Following 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) in liver-specific Brg1 deleted mice (Brg1-/-) (KO) mice and sex-matched wild-type (WT), depletion of Brg1 in mouse embryos caused liver cell growth disorders and significantly decreased expression of miR-187-5p. We identified LATS1 as a target gene of miR-187-5p and the introduction of miR-187-5p decrease the expression of LATS1 and inactivated the Hippo signalling pathway, which facilitated the expression of cell cycle-related proteins, and rescues the inhibitory effect of Brg1 in LR. Taken together, our findings suggested that deletion of Brg1 inhibits hepatocyte proliferation and LR by targeting miR-187-5p dependent on Hippo signalling pathway.
