Background:Non-curative (debulking) hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is occasionally applied for selected cases with bulky tumors or for oncologic emergency cases; however, the clinical usefulness of this procedure has not yet been fully evaluated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the patient outcomes of non-curative hepatic resections for HCC using data from bi-annual nationwide surveys conducted in Japan.Method:Data of 1084 non-curative hepatic resections for HCC were collected. The patient outcomes were compared with those of curative resections, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC).Results:Patient survival after the non-curative resection was poorer than that after curative resection (P Conclusion:The indications for non-curative hepatic resection in patients with HCC should be judged cautiously, especially in patients with extrahepatic tumor spread. This treatment approach may be beneficial for selected patients with intermediate- or advanced-stage HCC limited in liver and with good liver functional reserve.
