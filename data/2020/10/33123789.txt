Objectives:To prospectively assess the frequency of severe abdominal pain during and after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using the visual analog scale (VAS), and to identify predictive factors.Methods:Ninety-eight TACE performed in 80 patients (mean 65 ± 12 years old, 60 men) were consecutively and prospectively included. Abdominal pain was considered severe if the VAS ≥ 30/100 after treatment administration, or if opioid analgesic (grades 2-3) intake was required during hospitalization. Patient and tumor characteristics as well as technical factors associated with severe pain were identified by binary logistic regression.Results:The criterion for severe pain was met in 41/98 (42%) of procedures (peri-procedural pain 30/98 [31%] and opioid consumption during hospitalization 24/98 [25%]). Multivariate analysis identified age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.943 (95% confidence interval 0.895-0.994), p = 0.029), cirrhosis (OR = 0.284 (0.083-0.971), p = 0.045), and alcoholic liver disease (OR = 0.081 (0.010-0.659), p = 0.019) as negative predictive factors of severe abdominal pain. Severe abdominal pain occurred in or after 1/13 (8%), 8/34 (24%), 22/41 (54%), and 10/10 (100%) TACE sessions when none, one, two, and three of the protective factors were absent, respectively (p Conclusion:Severe abdominal pain was frequent during and after TACE revealing a clinically relevant and underestimated problem. A predictive model based on three readily available clinical variables suggests that young patients without alcoholic liver disease or cirrhosis could benefit from reinforced analgesia.Key points:• Severe abdominal pain occurs in 43% of TACE for HCC. • Younger age, absence of cirrhosis, and absence of alcoholic liver disease were identified as independent predictive factors of severe abdominal pain. • A simple combination of the three abovementioned features helped predict the occurrence of severe abdominal pain.
