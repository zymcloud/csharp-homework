Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a curative treatment option for early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Vascular inflow occlusion to the liver (Pringle manoeuvre) and multibipolar RFA (mbRFA) represent possibilities to generate large ablations. This study evaluated the impact of different interapplicator distances and a Pringle manoeuvre on ablation area and geometry of mbRFA. 24 mbRFA were planned in porcine livers in vivo. Test series with continuous blood flow had an interapplicator distance of 20 mm and 15 mm, respectively. For a Pringle manoeuvre, interapplicator distance was predefined at 20 mm. After liver dissection, ablation area and geometry were analysed macroscopically and histologically. Confluent and homogenous ablations could be achieved with a Pringle manoeuvre and an interapplicator distance of 15 mm with sustained hepatic blood flow. Ablation geometry was inhomogeneous with an applicator distance of 20 mm with physiological liver perfusion. A Pringle manoeuvre led to a fourfold increase in ablation area in comparison to sustained hepatic blood flow (p
