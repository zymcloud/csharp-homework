Background:Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) is a hepatic disorder caused by hemodynamic changes and systemic venous congestion following the Fontan procedure. FALD includes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), both of which may require liver transplantation (LT). However, the Fontan circulation, characterized by elevated central venous pressure and reduced cardiac output, is a challenging issue for surgeons and anesthesiologists.Case:We report a living-donor LT for the treatment of HCC. The patient was a 24-year-old male who underwent the Fontan procedure for pulmonary atresia and right ventricle hypoplasia. We focused on maintaining enough blood volume for cardiac output without causing pulmonary edema, as the patient is not well adapted to changes in volume. Owing to a multidisciplinary approach, the surgery was successfully performed without fatal adverse events.Conclusions:To our knowledge, this is the first case of isolated LT in a recipient who became an adult after having undergone the Fontan procedure.
