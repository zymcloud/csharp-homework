Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, increasing by 2% to 3% annually, with a dismal 5-year survival rate of 18%. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer criteria used to guide treatment considers performance status and assessment of liver function by Child-Pugh score in addition to tumor size and location. Curative therapies for HCC include surgical resection, liver transplantation, and tumor ablation. Patients with unresectable or inoperable lesions should be considered for arterially directed embolic therapy, systemic therapy, or radiation. Options for first-line systemic therapy of advanced HCC include sorafenib, lenvatinib, and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Nivolumab may be an option in patients with advanced HCC who are ineligible for tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other anti-angiogenic agents. Options for subsequent therapy following disease progression include regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, lenvatinib, nivolumab, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, sorafenib, or pembrolizumab. Patients with advanced HCC are at a high risk of adverse effects because of baseline hepatic dysfunction, comorbidities associated with chronic liver disease, and potential drug-drug interactions. Improved tolerance of therapies for advanced HCC may lead to reduction in treatment discontinuation and contribute to better patient outcomes. Managed care pharmacists should understand the recent efficacy and safety data, guideline recommendations, and treatment algorithms for management of HCC.
