We here report on a 74-year-old man diagnosed with a pT3cN0 BRAF-mutated and mismatch repair-deficient adenocarcinoma in the colon ascendens and 3 liver metastases. After hemicolectomy, the patient received treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. Three weeks later (on day 22), laboratory tests showed leukocytosis and an increase in transaminases; immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced hepatitis was suspected and prednisolone therapy was initiated. On day 29, the patient was acutely hospitalized due to dyspnea, somnolence and walking difficulties. Dysarthria, hoarseness, muscle pain and weakness had developed and the dose of prednisolone was increased. Serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase and myoglobin were increased and ICI-induced myositis was suspected. Antibodies against acetylcholine receptor and titin were present, indicating myasthenia gravis. Eventually, bulbar myopathy developed, including dysarthria and dysphagia, and the patient could no longer attain saturation without oxygen. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, intubated and given methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulins and infliximab. The patient developed carbon dioxide retention and died on day 39. Microscopical examination of the intercostal musculature, diaphragm, cervical musculature and tongue showed inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis consistent with a pronounced myositis. In the liver, microscopical examination did not show metastases from colorectal cancer but instead a hepatocellular cancer. The cause of death was determined as respiratory insufficiency due to polymyositis. In conclusion, ICIs may induce myositis combined with neurological immune-related adverse events. In patients developing muscle weakness and pain under ICI therapy, myositis should be suspected.
