Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) induces a change in serum HIF-1α level in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study investigated the prognostic value of change in serum HIF-1α following TACE treatment in HCC patients. A total of 61 hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with TACE were included. Peripheral blood samples were collected within 1 week before and after TACE to determine the serum levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum HIF-1α change was calculated as follows: ∆HIF-1α = (HIF-1α (pre-TACE) - HIF-1α (post-TACE))/HIF-1α (pre-TACE). Likewise, serum VEG-F change was calculated as follows: ∆VEG-F = (VEG-F (pre-TACE) - VEG-F(post-TACE))/VEG-F (pre-TACE). Based on the cutoffs (0.25) determined by the maximum Youden's index in receiver operating characteristic analysis, the patients were grouped into the low ∆HIF-1α group ( 0.25). After TACE treatment, HIF-1α was significantly decreased (pre-TACE 1901.62 vs. post-TACE 621.82 pg/ml, P
