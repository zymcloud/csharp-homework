Background: To explore the effects of postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE) on the prognosis of HCC patients with Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus (PVTT) undergoing resection, and to develop a PA-TACE-related nomogram for predicting survival individually. Patients and Methods: Two hundred and ninety-three consecutive HCC patients with PVTT under R0 hepatectomy were recruited. Forty-seven cases had recurrence within one month after surgery. The remaining 246 cases consisted of 90 PA-TACE and 156 non-PA-TACE cases. COX regression analysis was performed for overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) of these 246 cases, allowing the derivation of independent factors that were integrated into the nomogram. C-index, calibration curves, and risk stratification were performed to evaluate the performance and discriminative power of the nomograms. Results: In 246 patients without recurrence within one month after surgery, the OS and RFS for the PA-TACE group were significantly better than those for the non-PA-TACE group (P<0.0001, P<0.0001, respectively). After Cox regression analysis of OS or RFS, PA-TACE-related nomogram models were constructed. The C-index of the PA-TACE-related nomogram for OS and RFS was 0.72 and 0.73, respectively. Calibration curves revealed a good agreement between predictions and observations for the nomograms. Based on the nomogram-related risk stratification, Kaplan-Meier curves showed powerful discriminative ability. Conclusions: PA-TACE therapy improved the survival of HCC patients with PVTT undergoing hepatectomy. Accurate nomogram models were developed for predicting the individual survival and recurrence of these patients.
