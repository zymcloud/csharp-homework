Background: Circular RNA (circRNA) can regulate the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role and potential mechanism of circ_0004913 in HCC are not explored. Methods: Circ_0004913 was identified from two GSE datasets (GSE94508 and GSE97322) as a differentially expressed circRNA between HCC and normal tissues. Levels of circ_0004913, microRNA-184 (miR-184), and hepcidin (HAMP) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were estimated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, colony formation, and Transwell assays, respectively. Levels of all proteins were examined by Western blot. Glucose consumption and lactate and ATP production were analyzed by the glucose, lactate, and ATP assay kits. Dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down assays were performed to verify the interactions among miR-184 and circ_0004913 or HAMP. The mice xenograft models were established to assess the effect of circ_0004913 on tumor growth in vivo. Results: Circ_0004913 was downregulated in HCC, and its expression impeded cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, EMT, and glycolysis in HCC cells. miR-184 was identified as a target miRNA of circ_0004913, and their expression levels were negatively correlated. miR-184 overexpression could reverse the inhibitory effect of circ_0004913 on HCC cell progression. Moreover, as a target gene of miR-184, HAMP expression was positively correlated with circ_0004913 expression in HCC tissues, and repression of miR-184 could inhibit the progression of HCC cells by increasing HAMP expression. Circ_0004913 could inhibit JAK2/STAT3/AKT signaling pathway and tumor growth in vivo by regulating the miR-184/HAMP axis. Conclusion: Circ_0004913 inhibited the tumorigenesis of HCC by sponging miR-184 to regulate HAMP expression in vitro and in vivo.
