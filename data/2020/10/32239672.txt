MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been confirmed to play pivotal roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis. However, the underlying function of microRNA-33b (miR-33b) in HCC remains unclear. Here, we found that miR-33b level was significantly reduced in both HCC tissues and tumor cell lines. Further, luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis confirmed that Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli-1) was a direct target of miR-33b. Overexpression of miR-33b dramatically suppressed HCC tumor cell proliferation and cell mobility, but facilitated tumor cell apoptosis in vitro. Besides, restoration of Fli-1 partially attenuated miR-33b-mediated inhibition of cell growth and metastasis via activating Notch1 signaling and its downstream effectors. Our findings demonstrate the important role of miR-33b/Fli-1 axis in HCC progression and provide novel therapeutic candidates for HCC clinical treatment.
