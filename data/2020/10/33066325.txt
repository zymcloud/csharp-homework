Chemerin is protective in experimental models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Noteworthy, chemerin mRNA and protein were reduced in HCC tissues of Asian patients with mostly hepatitis B disease etiology. The current study nevertheless showed that chemerin protein was induced in tumor tissues of European HCC patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and patients with unclear disease etiology. A similar regulation was observed in hepatitis B virus (HBV), but not in hepatitis C virus (HCV), related HCC. The apparent discrepancy between the regulation of chemerin in HBV-HCC obtained from our study and recent reports led us to use the chemerin antibodies applied in the previous assays. These antibodies could not equally detect different chemerin isoforms, which were overexpressed in HepG2 cells. Higher chemerin protein in HCC was nevertheless confirmed by the use of all antibodies. Chemerin protein was low in Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells whereas HepG2 and Hep3B cells had chemerin protein similar as primary human hepatocytes. Besides, the anti-tumor effects of retinoids in hepatocyte cell lines did not enclose upregulation of chemerin, which was initially discovered as a tazarotene induced protein in the skin. Finally, protein levels of the chemerin receptor, chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), declined in non-viral, and tended to be lower in HBV-HCC tissues suggesting reduced chemerin activity in the tumors. To sum up, our work showed an opposite regulation of chemerin and CMKLR1 in NAFLD and HBV associated HCC. In HCV-HCC neither chemerin nor its receptor were changed in the tumor tissues. Current findings do not support a critical role of total chemerin protein levels in HCC of non-viral and viral etiology. Accordingly, tumor-localized chemerin protein was not associated with tumor-node-metastasis classification.
