Background:The objective of this study was to define the relative impact of alcohol and/or hepatitis-related HCC etiology on the outcomes of patients who underwent resection or transplantation for HCC.Methods:The SEER-Medicare database was used to identify patients with HCC between 2004 and 2015. Patients with history of alcohol abuse or hepatitis were identified. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression analysis.Results:Among 1140 patients, 11.9% (n = 136) of patients had alcohol-related HCC, 30.0% (n = 342) hepatitis-related HCC, and 58.1% (n = 662) had other cause-related HCC. On multivariable analysis, patients with alcohol-related HCC (HR:1.06, 95%CI:0.82-1.35) or hepatitis-related HCC (HR:1.05, 95%CI:0.88-1.26) had similar hazards of death compared with patients who had non-alcohol/non-hepatitis-related HCC. Patients who had tumor size â‰¤5 cm had lower hazards of death (HR:0.81, 95%CI:0.68-0.97), while individuals who underwent liver resection (vs. transplantation) had almost a two-fold higher hazards of death (HR:1.99, 95%CI:1.47-2.69).Conclusion:Tumor specific factors (i.e. tumor size and stage) and operative approach (i.e. resection vs. transplantation) -rather than HCC etiology- dictated both OS and CSS.
