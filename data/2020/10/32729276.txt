Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) is a primary liver cancer (PLC) with both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic phenotypes. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated its histological classification system for cHCC-CCA. Compared to the previous WHO histological classification system, the new version no longer recognizes subtypes of cHCC-CCA with stem cell features. Furthermore, some of these cHCC-CCA subtypes with stem cell features have been recategorized as either hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs). Additionally, distinctive diagnostic terms for intermediate cell carcinomas and cholangiolocarcinomas (previous cholangiolocellular carcinoma subtype) are now recommended. It is important for radiologists to understand these changes because of its potential impact on the imaging-based diagnosis of HCC, particularly because cHCC-CCAs frequently manifest as HCC mimickers, ICC mimickers, or as indeterminate on imaging studies. Therefore, in this review, we introduce the 2019 WHO classification system for cHCC-CCA, illustrate important imaging features characteristic of its subtypes, discuss the impact on imaging-based diagnosis of HCC, and address other important considerations.
