Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent human malignancy with high morbidity worldwide. Hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex multistep process, and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of newly discovered molecules, have been revealed as essential regulators in the development of HCC. HCC-associated lncRNAs affect multiple malignant phenotypes by modulating gene expression or protein activity. Moreover, the dysregulation of lncRNAs in the liver is also associated with diseases predisposing to HCC, such as chronic viral infection, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. A deeper understanding of the lncRNA regulatory network in the multistep processes of HCC development will provide new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. In this review, we introduce the biogenesis and function of lncRNAs and summarize recent knowledge on how lncRNAs regulate the malignant hallmarks of HCC, such as uncontrolled cell proliferation, resistance to cell death, metabolic reprogramming, immune escape, angiogenesis, and metastasis. We also review emerging insights into the role of lncRNAs in HCC-associated liver diseases. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of lncRNAs as early diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
