Background:Anatomical segmentectomy is a technically challenging procedure because tertiary portal pedicles are multiple, variable, and deep inside the liver.1 Anatomical segmentectomy can be performed using the transfissural Glissonean approach through the opening main portal fissure or umbilical fissure.1-3 We present laparoscopic anatomical resection of segment 4b using the transfissural Glissonean approach.Methods:A 67-year-old man was referred for treatment of single nodular mass in segment 4b. The surgical procedure involved the following steps: (1) Opening of the umbilical fissure along the umbilical fissure vein (2) Dissection of Glissonean pedicle 4b (3) Identification of ischemic territory of segment 4b (4) Right-side parenchymal transection along the ischemic line.Results:The operative time was 230 min, and the estimated blood loss was 100 mL. The final histopathological diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor size was 30 mm and the resection margin was 25 mm. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery, and he was discharged on postoperative day 6.Conclusion:The transfissural Glissonean approach for laparoscopic anatomic resection of segment 4 b is a feasible and effective technique. The opening of the umbilical fissure allows the surgeon to dissect the target portal pedicles of segment 4b directly.
