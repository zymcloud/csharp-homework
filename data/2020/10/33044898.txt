Viral hepatitis is a deadly disease which can manifest as acute, chronic, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. Information about hepatitis is scarce among animal handlers. Due to Federal Government of Nigeria diversification programmes, many people are now involved in animal farming which can make them susceptible to viral hepatitis. This study aimed at determining the prevalence of Hepatitis B, C, and E viruses among animal handlers in Abeokuta, southwestern Nigerian. A total of 156 subjects were recruited for the study. Sociodemographic and risks factors data were fetched from subjects using interviewer-administered questionnaire. Blood samples were collected via venepuncture and tested for HCV, HBV, and HEV using ELISA technique. Results were analyzed using SPSS software version 21.0 and P value â‰¤ 0.05 was considered significant. The prevalence of HCV, HBV, and HEV were 46 (29.5%), 20 (12.8%), and 4 (2.6%) respectively while 6 (3.8%), 1 (0.6%), and 1 (0.6%) had co-infection of HBV-HCV, HBV-HEV, and HCV- HEV respectively. This study concludes that there is high prevalence of hepatitis C and B viruses among animal handlers in Abeokuta, Ogun state which is of significant public health problem, warranting further attention and research.
