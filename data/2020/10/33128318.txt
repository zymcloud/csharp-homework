N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is a candidate tumor suppressor in various cancers, including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). NDRG2, as a stress-responsive protein, is induced by several stress-related signaling pathways and NDRG2 negatively regulates various signal transduction pathways. Although it has not been found to function alone, NDRG2 binds serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), generating a complex that is involved in the regulation of various target proteins. The main function of NDRG2 is to maintain cell homeostasis by suppressing stress-induced signal transduction; however, in cancer, genomic deletions and/or promoter methylation may inhibit the expression of NDRG2, resulting in enhanced tumor development via overactivated signal transduction pathways. A wide variety of tumors develop in Ndrg2-deficient mice, including T-cell lymphoma, liver, lung and other tumors, the characteristics of which are similar to those in Pten-deficient mice. In particular, PTEN is a target molecule of the NDRG2/PP2A complex, which enhances PTEN phosphatase activity by dephosphorylating residues in the PTEN C-terminal region. In ATLL cells, loss of NDRG2 expression leads to the failed recruitment of PP2A to PTEN, resulting in the inactivation of PTEN phosphatase with phosphorylation, ultimately leading to the activation of PI3K/AKT. Thus, NDRG2, as a PP2A adaptor, regulates the global phosphorylation of important signaling molecules. Moreover, the downregulation of NDRG2 expression via long-term stress-induced methylation is directly correlated with the development of ATLL and other cancers. Thus, NDRG2 might be important for the development of stress-induced leukemia and other cancers and has become an important target for novel molecular therapies.
