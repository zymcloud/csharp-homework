Background: Laparoscopic microwave thermal ablation (LMWTA) is a well-established alternative treatment to liver resection for treatment of liver tumors. The aim of this study was to describe our experience in LMWTA for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatic patients. Materials and Methods: A study group of 61 consecutive HCC patients treated with LMWTA from January, 2013 to May, 2020 were considered for this study. Patient characteristics, liver function test, operational characteristics, and complications were recorded. Results: Of the 61 patients who underwent LMWTA, median age was 64 (interquartile range [IQR]: 58-71) years, mean body mass index was 26.2 (IQR: 23.2-29.4); 44 patients (72%) presented with an hepatitis C virus etiology, 46 (75%) were Child-Pugh Class A, median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 8.0 (IQR: 7.0-9.4). Viral infection was confirmed to be the most important risk factor in determining progressive cirrhotic evolution with HCC expression. Conclusions: LMWTA is a safe alternative treatment to traditional surgery, and can be combined with surgery.
