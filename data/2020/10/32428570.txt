Background and objective:Leptin receptor (LEPR) signaling inhibits apoptosis, promotes angiogenesis and proliferation, and plays a critical role in carcinogenesis. Variants of the LEPR gene may be key factors in the growth of human malignant tumors. However, the relationship between LEPR polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we further investigated the association between LEPR polymorphisms and the risk of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis (LC), and HCC in a southern Guangxi Chinese population.Method:Two LEPR polymorphisms (rs1137100 and rs1137101) were genotyped in 138 CHB patients, 136 patients with LC, 149 HCC patients, and 146 healthy controls using the SNaPshot method.Results:We did not observe any significant difference in the LEPR rs1137100 and rs1137101 polymorphisms between the groups of healthy controls and patients (all p > 0.05), regardless of genotypes, alleles, or haplotypes.Conclusions:Our data suggest that the genetic variants of the LEPR gene are not associated with the risk of HBV-related liver diseases (CHB, LC, and HCC) in the Guangxi population. Further studies are necessary to validate these results.
