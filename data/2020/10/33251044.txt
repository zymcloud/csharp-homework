The signature composed of immune-related long noncoding ribonucleic acids (irlncRNAs) with no requirement of specific expression level seems to be valuable in predicting the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we retrieved raw transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), identified irlncRNAs by co-expression analysis, and recognized differently expressed irlncRNA (DEirlncRNA) pairs using univariate analysis. In addition, we modified Lasso penalized regression. Then, we compared the areas under curve, counted the Akaike information criterion (AIC) values of 5-year receiver operating characteristic curve, and identified the cut-off point to set up an optimal model for distinguishing the high- or low-disease-risk groups among patients with HCC. We then reevaluated them from the viewpoints of survival, clinic-pathological characteristics, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, chemotherapeutics efficacy, and immunosuppressed biomarkers. 36 DEirlncRNA pairs were identified, 12 of which were included in a Cox regression model. After regrouping the patients by the cut-off point, we could more effectively differentiate between them based on unfavorable survival outcome, aggressive clinic-pathological characteristics, specific tumor immune infiltration status, low chemotherapeutics sensitivity, and highly expressed immunosuppressed biomarkers. The signature established by paring irlncRNA regardless of expression levels showed a promising clinical prediction value.
