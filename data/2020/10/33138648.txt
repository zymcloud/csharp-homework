Objective:This meta-analysis aims to explore the diagnostic value and accuracy of circulating lncRNAs as biomarkers of digestive system tumors.Methods:PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science were searched for relevant articles that were published before April 2019, and a meta-analysis was conducted.Results:52 studies with 63 lncRNAs were discussed in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.81) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.75-0.77), respectively. The pooled DOR (the diagnostic odds ratio) was 15.63 (95% CI: 12.77-19.12), and the overall AUC (the area under the curve) was 0.87. Besides, subgroup analyzes showed that the DOR and AUC of large sample sizes (>80), multiple lncRNAs, serum-based lncRNAs, and downregulation group were superior to those of small sample sizes (â‰¤80), single lncRNA, plasma-based lncRNAs, and upregulation group, respectively. The current data also highlight that the diagnostic accuracy of circulating lncRNAs in the case of colorectal cancer was higher than gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. And there is no difference in the perspective of geographical regions.Conclusion:The circulating lncRNAs have high diagnostic value and accuracy in digestive system cancers and may serve as potential biomarkers.
