Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Clinical guidelines for HCC have been established and revised by many countries and regions. We summarized and compared the treatment algorithms in the updated HCC guidelines established by Japan, China, Hong Kong, the Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and the European Association for the Study of the Liver and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. Variations in treatment algorithms between the guidelines is inevitable, considering the differences in the prevalence and etiology of HCC, local clinical practice, and medical and insurance systems between countries or regions, and this might be confusing for practitioners worldwide. A comprehensive understanding of the guidelines that are globally available might be useful for future improvement of each guideline.
