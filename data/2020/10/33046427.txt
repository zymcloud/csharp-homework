Objective:To reveal the effect of lncRNA miR503HG on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The expressions of miR503HG, miR-15b and PDCD4 in HCC tissues and cell lines were measured. After cell transfection, Transwell assay tested the migration and invasion ability of HCC cells. qRT-PCR and Western blot detected the expressions of EMT markers (E-cad, N-cad, Vim and Snail-1). Matrigel-based tube formation assay assessed the angiogenesis capacity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured in conditioned medium of treated HCC cells. ELISA detected the level of VEGF in supernatant of HUVECs. RIP, RNA pulldown and dual-luciferase reporter assay were applied to verify the binding of miR-15b to miR503HG or PDCD4. pcDNA3.1-miR503HG-BEL-7404 cells or pcDNA3.1-BEL-7404 cells were implanted into nude mice for construction of HCC model in vivo.Results:miR503HG and PDCD4 were under-expressed and miR-15b was over-expressed in HCC cells and tissues. Up-regulation of miR503HG and PDCD4 or inhibition of miR-15b hindered migration, invasion and EMT of HCC cells and angiogenesis of HUVECs. Both miR503HG and PDCD4 could bind to miR-15b. Over-expression of miR503HG suppressed HCC growth and angiogenesis in nude mice.Conclusion:LncRNA miR503HG suppresses EMT and angiogenesis in HCC via miR-15b/PDCD4 axis.
