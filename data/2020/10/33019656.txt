An increased understanding of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and its regulation may facilitate drug development for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Triciribine (TCN), which is a highly selective AKT inhibitor, increases the stability of LDLR mRNA downstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Here, a candidate approach was used in order to determine whether the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) ZFP36 ring finger protein like 1 (ZFP36L1) and Hu antigen R (HuR) play a role in TCN-mediated stabilization of LDLR mRNA. The depletion of HuR led to a reduction of LDLR mRNA stability, an event that was more pronounced in TCN-treated cells. TCN was found to induce the translocation of nuclear HuR to cytoplasm in an ERK-dependent manner. ZFP36L1 depletion increased the stability of LDLR mRNA consistent with its destabilizing role. However, in contrast to HuR, TCN had no effect on LDLR mRNA turnover in ZFP36L1-depleted cells. TCN induced the phosphorylation of ZFP36L1 in an ERK/RSK-dependent manner and promoted its dissociation from the CCR4-NOT complex. In sum, these data suggest that TCN utilizes ERK signaling to increase the activity of HuR and inhibit ZFP36L1 to stabilize LDLR mRNA in HepG2 cells.
