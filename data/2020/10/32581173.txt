We report a 71-year-old man with non-B non-C chronic liver damage who had been regularly visiting our hospital since he was 38 years of age. He underwent three partial hepatectomies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosed at 65, 67, and 71 years of age, respectively. A histopathological examination showed moderately-differentiated HCC, and chronic hepatitis with mild fibrosis stage in non-tumor areas. alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and PIVKAII were not useful for the early prediction of HCC, but TERT promotor mutation (C228T) in serum cell-free DNA was useful. This is the first report on the importance of long-term follow-up in non-B non-C chronic liver damage, regardless of the fibrosis stage.
