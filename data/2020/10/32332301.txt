Ga-FAPI PET/CT was performed in a 56-year-old cirrhotic patient with multiple liver nodules, which were suspected of hepatocellular carcinoma by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance but were not visualized by F-FDG PET/CT. Increased Ga-FAPI liver uptake was observed in this cirrhotic patient. However, the nodules had no pathological Ga-FAPI uptake and were clearly visualized due to the low activity compared with surrounding liver parenchyma. The Ga-FAPI PET/CT features, suggestive of benign nodules, have been later confirmed by histopathological examination. This case suggested that Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be useful in the differentiation between benign nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma in the patient with liver cirrhosis.
