Background:Postoperative extrahepatic metastases (EHM) contribute to a grim outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are undergoing curative surgical resection. The current study investigated the clinical value of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in predicting EHM after curative surgery.Methods:A total of 197 patients with HCC who were undergoing curative surgical resection were assigned to a retrospective training cohort (144 patients) or a prospective validation cohort (53 patients). The CELLSEARCH system was used for the detection of CTCs prior to surgical resection and 1 month thereafter. The cutoff value of CTCs was estimated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing in a Cox proportional hazards regression model.Results:In the training cohort, EHM was found to be associated with a higher postoperative CTC burden compared with no EHM (mean: 4.33 vs 0.52; P Conclusions:A postoperative CTC count â‰¥3 appears to be a surrogate marker for the prediction of EHM after curative surgical resection of HCC. More careful surveillance should be recommended to patients with a high CTC load to ensure the greater possibility of early interventions for postoperative EHM.
