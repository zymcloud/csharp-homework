Background Perfluorobutane (PFB) and sulfur hexafluoride (SHF) have different physiologic characteristics, but it is unclear whether hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) show similar wash-in and washout patterns to both contrast agents at US. Purpose To investigate Contrast-Enhanced US Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) version 2017 HCC categorization by comparing PFB-enhanced US and SHF-enhanced US in participants at high risk for HCC. Materials and Methods In this prospective study conducted from February to August 2019, participants at high risk for HCC with treatment-naive hepatic observations (≥1 cm) categorized as LR-3, LR-4, LR-5, or LR-M (intermediate probability of HCC, probable HCC, definitely HCC, and probably malignant but not HCC specific, respectively) on cross-sectional images were screened. They underwent same-day PFB-enhanced US and SHF-enhanced US. Arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), washout time and degree, and echogenicity in the Kupffer phase (PFB-enhanced US) were evaluated and categorized by the operator using CEUS LI-RADS, who referred to the radiologist who performed the contrast-enhanced US, and by a reviewer. Diagnostic performance was analyzed using the McNemar test. Results Fifty-nine participants were evaluated (43 with HCC, 10 with non-HCC malignancies, six with benign findings). Nonrim APHE was identically observed in 95% (41 of 43, operator) or 88% (38 of 43, reviewer) of HCCs with both contrast agents. Among 43 HCCs, late (≥60 seconds) and mild washout were more frequent with PFB-enhanced US (34 with operator, 33 with reviewer) than with SHF-enhanced US (24 with operator, 26 with reviewer) (P = .04 or P = .12). The washout time for HCCs was later at PFB-enhanced US (median, 101 seconds ± 11) than at SHF-enhanced US (median, 84 seconds ± 5; P = .04). Sensitivity (34 of 43; 79%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 64%, 90%) was higher with PFB-enhanced US than with SHF-enhanced US (23 of 43; 54%; 95% CI: 38%, 67%; P = .01). Specificity was 100% (95% CI: 79%, 100%) with both. Hypoenhancement in the Kupffer phase was more common in malignant (49 of 53 [92%] for both operator and reviewer) than in benign (two of six [33%] for operator, one of six [16%] for reviewer) lesions. Conclusion On the basis of the Contrast-Enhanced US Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2017 algorithm, noninvasive US diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma by using perfluorobutane-enhanced US had higher diagnostic performance than sulfur hexafluoride-enhanced US, without loss of specificity. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
