Background:NEK2 has an established involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the roles of NEK2 and its interacting proteins in HCC have not been systematically explored.Methods:This study examined NEK2 and its interacting proteins in HCC based on multiple databases.Results:NEK2 mRNA was highly expressed in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues. The survival of HCC patients with high NEK2 mRNA expression was shorter than those with low expression. MAD1L1, CEP250, MAPK1, NDC80, PPP1CA, PPP1R2 and NEK11 were the interacting proteins of NEK2. Among them, NDC80 and CEP250 were the key interacting proteins of NEK2. Mitotic prometaphase may be the key pathway that NEK2 and its interacting proteins contributed to HCC pathogenesis. NEK2, NDC80 and CEP250 mRNAs were highly expressed in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues. The mRNA levels of NEK2 were positively correlated with those of NDC80 or CEP250. Univariate regression showed that NEK2, NDC80 and CEP250 mRNA expressions were significantly associated with HCC patients' survival. Multivariate regression showed that NDC80 mRNA expression was an independent predictor for HCC patients' survival. Methylations and genetic alterations of NEK2, NDC80 and CEP250 were observed in HCC samples. The alterations of NEK2, NDC80 and CEP250 genes were co-occurrence. Patients with high mRNA expression and genetic alterations of NEK2, NDC80 and CEP250 had poor prognosis.Conclusions:NEK2 and its interacting proteins NDC80 and CEP250 play important roles in HCC development and progression and thus may be potentially used as biomarkers and therapeutic targets of HCC.
