Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Herein, we explored the underlying mechanism by which Propofol inhibited the development of HCC.Methods:3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was carried out to detect the viability and proliferation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to detect the expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19, microRNA-520a-3p (miR-520a-3p), LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), metastasis-associated markers (Snail, Twist, Vimentin and E-cadherin) and exosome markers (CD9 and CD81). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the morphology and structure of exosomes. The apoptosis and metastasis were measured by flow cytometry and transwell assays. StarBase software was utilized to predict the targets of H19 and miR-520a-3p. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the interaction between miR-520a-3p and H19 or LIMK1. Nude mice bearing tumors were used to validate the role of exosomal H19.Results:The high expression of exosomal H19 accelerated the proliferation and motility while hampering the apoptosis of HCC cells. MiR-520a-3p could bind with H19. Exosomal H19 exacerbated HCC through sponging miR-520a-3p. The 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of LIMK1 could bind to miR-520a-3p. MiR-520a-3p mimic transfection reversed the inhibitory effect of high expression of exosomal LIMK1 on the apoptosis of HCC cells and the promoting effects on the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells. The mRNA and protein levels of LIMK1 were regulated by H19/miR-520a-3p signaling. The high level of exosomal H19 promoted the growth of HCC tumors in vivo.Conclusion:Circulating H19 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion and inhibited the apoptosis of HCC cells treated with Propofol through upregulating LIMK1 via sponging miR-520a-3p.
