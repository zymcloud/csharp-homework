We performed a medaka bioassay for the carcinogenicity of methylazoxymethaol acetate (MAM-Ac) to examine the sequential histological changes in the liver from 3 days after exposure until tumor development. The medaka were exposed to MAM-Ac at a concentration of 2 ppm for 24 hours, and were necropsied at 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 60, and 91 days after exposure. MAM-Ac induced four cases of hepatocellular adenoma and one case of hepatocellular carcinoma in 8 fish after 60 or 91 days of exposure. Histological changes in the liver until tumor development were divided into three phases. In the cytotoxic phase (1-10 days), MAM-Ac-exposed hepatocytes showed vacuolar degeneration and underwent necrosis and apoptosis, resulting in multiple foci of hepatocyte loss. In the repopulation phase (14-35 days), the areas of hepatocyte loss were filled with hepatic cysts and the remaining hepatocytes were surrounded by hepatic stellate-like cells (or spindle cells) and gradually disappeared. In the proliferation phase (42-91 days), the original hepatic parenchyma was regenerated and progressively replaced by regenerative hyperplastic nodules and/or liver neoplasms. The medaka retained a strong hepatocyte regenerative ability in response to liver injury. It is considered that this ability promotes the proliferation of initiated hepatocytes in multistep carcinogenesis and influences the development of liver tumor over a short period in medaka.
