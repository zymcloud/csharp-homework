Objectives:We have confirmed the diagnostic value of protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) in a French cohort of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we aim to study the biological response under treatment and the prognostic value of PIVKA-II serum level in patients treated for HCC.Methods:Patients with primary HCC developed chronic liver disease with serum PIVKA-II, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels available at baseline and after first HCC treatment [within 3 months (M1-M3) and/or within 6-9 months (M6-M9)] were included.Results:A total of 94 patients were included. Median follow-up was 23 months (range 11-31 months). PIVKA-II levels significantly decreased from baseline to M1-M3 (P = 0.002) and to M6-M9 (P = 0.035). By multivariate analysis, biological response (M1-M3/baseline PIVKA-II ratio) independently and significantly predicted overall survival (OS). A ratio below 0.73 was able to identify patients with the better prognosis in the total population [OS: 27 months (range 17-31) vs. 17 (range 9-25); P = 0.008] and in patients who had transarterial chemoembolization or selective internal radiation therapy as first treatment approach [OS: 26 months (range 14-31) vs. 16 (range 9-25); P = 0.002 and 2-year OS of 73% vs. 30%; P = 0.009]. PIVKA-II serum levels at baseline and PIVKA-II biological response were significantly associated with radiological response.Conclusion:PIVKA-II serum level seems to be a good prognostic and promising biomarker for early monitoring treatment outcomes for patients with HCC.
