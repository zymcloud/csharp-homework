Objective:No surgical or radiotherapeutic treatment guidelines exist for oligometastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (oHNSCC), and only recently have interventions with curative intent been studied. Herein, we sought to elucidate survival rates among patients with oHNSCC to determine if treatment with curative intent is warranted in this population.Study design:Retrospective chart review.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed cases of oHNSCC treated between March 1998 and March 2018. Fisher's exact test was used to compare patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) to those who underwent surgical excision and to compare outcomes of patients with oligometastases at the time of initial presentation to those that developed oligometastatic disease after primary treatment.Results:Eighty one patients with metastases to the lungs, ribs, pelvis, vertebral column, liver, clavicle, and sternum were included. Overall, 32 patients (40%) were alive 5 years post-treatment. The site of metastasis, the modality of treatment, and the time of development of oligometastatic disease did not significantly affect 5-year survival.Conclusion:Herein, we demonstrate that multi-modality treatment of oHNSCC is warranted for some patients with an estimated 40% 5-year survival. Aggressive treatment of the primary and regional sites is necessary in addition to treatment of the metastatic site and incurs a survival benefit compared to patients with metastatic HNSCC treated with systemic therapy alone. oHNSCC should be approached separately from polymetastatic disease. Patients should be counseled about the possibility for long-term survival, and aggressive initial treatment with the intention for cure should be considered in this population.Level of evidence:4 Laryngoscope, 2020.
