Liver cancer is the most rapidly increasing cancer in the United States and is associated with a high cancer-related mortality. Seventy-five percent of liver cancers are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resulting from cirrhosis. Patients are typically diagnosed late in the disease, with a relatively small percentage eligible for curative treatments. Despite the addition of several new therapies for advanced HCC, the 5-year survival rate is just 18%. The direct and indirect costs of HCC are substantial, and are expected to increase with the rise in disease incidence as well as a growing number of high-cost therapies entering the market. There are opportunities to improve the quality of care for patients with HCC through implementation of value-based reimbursement principles and pharmacist involvement in care.
