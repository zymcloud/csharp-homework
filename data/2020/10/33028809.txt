Involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hepatocarcinogenesis has been largely documented. Mitochondrial dynamics is identified to impact survival and metastasis in tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. This study planned to explore the regulation of lncRNA LL22NC03-N14H11.1 on HCC progression and mitochondrial fission. Dysregulated lncRNAs in HCC are identified through circlncRNAnet and GEPIA bioinformatics tools. Biological function of LL22NC03-N14H11.1 in HCC was detected by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, transwell invasion, and wound healing assays. Molecular interactions were determined by RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Results showed that LL22NC03-N14H11.1 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Functionally, LL22NC03-N14H11.1 contributed to cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC. Moreover, LL22NC03-N14H11.1 facilitated mitochondrial fission in HCC cells. Mechanistically, LL22NC03-N14H11.1 recruited Myb proto-oncogene (c-Myb) to repress the transcription of leucine zipper-like transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1), so as to inhibit LZTR1-mediated ubiquitination of H-RAS (G12V), leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and induction of p-DRP1 (Serine 616). In conclusion, this study firstly revealed that lncRNA LL22NC03-N14H11.1 promoted HCC progression through activating H-RAS/MAPK pathway to induce mitochondrial fission, indicating LL22NC03-N14H11.1 as a novel potential biomarker for HCC treatment.
