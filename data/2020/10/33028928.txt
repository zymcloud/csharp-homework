Hepatocellular carcinoma is rapidly becoming one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths, largely due to the increasing incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This in part may be attributed to Westernised diets high in fructose sugar. While many studies have shown the effects of fructose on inducing metabolic-related liver diseases, little research has investigated the effects of fructose sugar on liver cancer metabolism. The present study aimed to examine the metabolic effects of fructose on hepatocellular carcinoma growth in vitro and in vivo. Fructose sugar was found to reduce cell growth in vitro, and caused alterations in the expression of enzymes involved in the serine-glycine synthesis and pentose phosphate pathways. These biosynthesis pathways are highly active in cancer cells and they utilise glycolytic by-products to produce energy and nucleotides for growth. Hence, the study further investigated the efficacy of two novel drugs that inhibit these pathways, namely NCT-503 and Physcion. The study is the first to show that the combination treatment of NCT-503 and Physcion substantially inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma growth in vitro and in vivo. The combination of fructose diet and metabolism-inhibiting drugs may provide a unique metabolic environment that warrants further investigation in targeting hepatocellular carcinoma.
