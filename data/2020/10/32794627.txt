Stem cells or their closely related committed progenitor cells are the likely founder cells of most neoplasms. In the continually renewing and hierarchically organized epithelia of the oesophagus, stomach and intestine, homeostatic stem cells are located at the beginning of the cell flux, in the basal layer of the oesophagus, the isthmic region of gastric oxyntic glands and at the bottom of gastric pyloric-antral glands and colonic crypts. The introduction of mutant oncogenes such as KrasG12D or loss of Tp53 or Apc to specific cell types expressing the likes of Lgr5 and Mist1 can be readily accomplished in genetically engineered mouse models to initiate tumorigenesis. Other origins of cancer are discussed including 'reserve' stem cells that may be activated by damage or through disruption of morphogen gradients along the crypt axis. In the liver and pancreas, with little cell turnover and no obvious stem cell markers, the importance of regenerative hyperplasia associated with chronic inflammation to tumour initiation is vividly apparent, though inflammatory conditions in the renewing populations are also permissive for tumour induction. In the liver, hepatocytes, biliary epithelial cells and hepatic progenitor cells are embryologically related, and all can give rise to hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. In the exocrine pancreas, both acinar and ductal cells can give rise to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), although the preceding preneoplastic states are quite different: acinar-ductal metaplasia gives rise to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia culminating in PDAC, while ducts give rise to PDAC via. mucinous cell metaplasia that may have a polyclonal origin.
