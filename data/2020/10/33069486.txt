Background:Liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is curative in most cases; however, recurrence is observed in some patients. The Risk Estimation of Tumor Recurrence After Transplant (RETREAT) score is an externally validated scoring system for prediction of post-LT HCC recurrence. The Cleveland Clinic Florida Scoring System (CCFSS) is a potential new scoring system for prediction of HCC recurrence. Our study aimed to compare the RETREAT and CCFSS.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 52 adult patients with HCC who underwent LT at a tertiary care center. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square analyses were conducted to compare the RETREAT and CCFSS classifications for detecting HCC recurrence.Results:A total of 52 patients underwent LT. The median follow-up period was 37 months. Four patients had post-LT HCC recurrence, with all recurrences occurring within 2 years of LT. The RETREAT score was better able to detect low, moderate, and high levels of risk (P Conclusions:This is the first study to evaluate the CCFSS as a potential new scoring system to predict HCC recurrence after LT. The RETREAT score is more specific than the CCFSS. The incorporation of alpha-fetoprotein level at the time of LT improves the estimation of HCC recurrence in the post-LT period.
