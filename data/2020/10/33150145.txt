Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. HCC incidence rate is sixth and mortality is fourth worldwide. However, HCC pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The incidence of HCC is associated with genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors. The role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of HCC has attracted researchers' attention because of anatomical and functional interactions between liver and intestine. Studies have demonstrated the involvement of gut microbiota in the development of HCC and chronic liver diseases, such as alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and liver cirrhosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of receptors with diverse biological functions. Natural and synthetic PPAR agonists show potential for treatment of NAFLD, liver fibrosis, and HCC. Recent studies have demonstrated that PPARs take part in gut microbiota inhabitation and adaptation. This manuscript reviews the role of gut microbiota in the development of HCC and precancerous diseases, the role of PPARs in modulation of gut microbiota and HCC, and potential of gut microbiota for HCC diagnosis and treatment.
