The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is objective, reproducible, and it has shown to predict mortality related to cirrhosis. This study was undertaken to investigate safety of robotic hepatectomy in patients with elevated preoperative MELD score and to examine correlation between preoperative MELD scores and postoperative outcomes after robotic hepatectomy for liver tumors. Demographic data, MELD score, and clinical outcomes were prospectively collected. Regression analysis was used. Data are presented as median (mean ± SD). 75 patients underwent robotic hepatectomy. Age was 64 (62.5 ± 14.2) years and BMI 28 (29 ± 7.0) kg/m2; 56% women. 60 (81%) of the hepatectomies were undertaken for malignancy (25% hepatocellular carcinoma, 20% colorectal metastasis, 15% cholangiocarcinoma). On regression analysis, MELD score did not correlate with operative time (p = 0.518) or blood loss (p = 0.583). MELD score, however, correlated with length of stay (p = 0.002). 8 (11%) patients experienced postoperative complications; their MELD score was 7 (8 ± 2.5). 68 (91%) patients did not experience postoperative complications; their MELD score was 7 (8 ± 2.8) (p = 0.803). One patient died in this series. In patients undergoing robotic hepatectomy to treat liver tumors, preoperative MELD score only correlates with length of stay. Preoperative MELD score does not correlate with operative time and amount of blood loss. An elevated MELD score should not deter surgeons from offering robotic hepatectomy.
