Rationale and objectives:To investigate the technical success, safety and outcomes of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with simultaneous cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided microwave ablation (MWA) in small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC).Materials and methods:Retrospective analysis of 66 lesions in 50 patients (38 men, 12 women) who underwent TACE combined with simultaneous CBCT-guided MWA for SHCC. After 1 month of treatment, the tumor responses were assessed using the mRECIST criteria, along with interventional-related complications and changes in hepatic and renal function. Moreover, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated.Results:All patients achieved technical success. The mean target tumor size was 3.4 ± 0.7 (range, 2.2-4.9) cm. The mean energy, ablation duration per tumor, and the mean safety margin were 51.3 ± 8.4 kJ, 6.7 ± 0.8 minutes and 1.4 ± 0.6 cm, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year PFS rates were 90.0%, 65.4%, and 35.7%, respectively, with a mean PFS of 43.46 months; and the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 98.0%, 89.8%, and 74.3%, respectively, with a mean OS of 54.90 months. Multivariate Cox regression analysis further illustrated that TACE combined with MWA in the treatment of a single tumor with a diameter of less than 3 cm was an independent protective factor for PFS and OS (p Conclusion:CBCT-guided TACE combined with simultaneous MWA was a safe and successful treatment of SHCC with a high technical efficacy.
