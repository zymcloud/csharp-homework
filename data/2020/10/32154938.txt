Background and aim:Entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) may reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, it is not clear whether there is difference in the on-treatment HCC risks between ETV and TDF.Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, we compared the on-treatment HCC incidence of ETV and TDF in 1340 consecutive nucleos(t)ide analog-na√Øve CHB patients by propensity score (PS) matching analysis. PS was calculated by using age, sex, drinking history, diabetes, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B e antigen positivity, hepatitis B virus DNA, hepatitis B s antigen titer, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alpha-fetoprotein, albumin, bilirubin, prothrombin time, platelet count, and calendar year of treatment initiation as covariates. The HCC risk was assessed by Cox regression with death and liver transplantation as competing risks in the 1:1 PS-matched cohorts (n = 596).Results:TDF had higher cumulative virologic response (P = 0.027) whereas ETV showed higher AST and ALT normalization rates (P = 0.005 and Conclusions:ETV and TDF treatment was associated with similar risk for HCC development in CHB patients.
