The natural flavonoid chrysin possesses antiproliferative activity against various types of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a common malignancy. However, the exact mechanism of chrysin antiproliferative activity remains unclear. This research was executed to explore the impact of chrysin on glypican-3 (GPC3)/sulfatase-2 (SULF2) axis and lncRNA-AF085935 expression in HCC using HepG2 cells. Cisplatin (20, 50, 100 μg/mL), chrysin (15, 30, and 60 μg/mL) and the combination of 50 μg/mL cisplatin with different concentrations of chrysin were applied for 24/48 h. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Protein levels of GPC3 and SULF2 were measured by ELISA at 24/48 h. GPC3 immunoreactivity was detected by immunocytochemistry. Moreover, GPC3 and SULF2 mRNA expressions in addition to lncRNA-AF085935 expression were assessed by qPCR at 48 h. The GPC3 protein, immunostaining and mRNA levels, SULF2 protein and mRNA levels, as well as lncRNA-AF085935 expression, were decreased significantly with cisplatin and chrysin alone when compared with the control untreated HepG2 cells. However, the combination treatment exhibited a better chemopreventive effect in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This study demonstrated, for the first time, the antiproliferative activity of chrysin against HCC through the suppression of the GPC3/SULF2 axis along with the downregulation of lncRNA-AF085935 expression. Synergistic effect of chrysin with cisplatin could potentiate their antiproliferative action in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
