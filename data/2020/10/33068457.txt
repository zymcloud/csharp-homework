A series of N-pyridinylbenzamides was designed and prepared to investigate the influence of isosterism and positional isomerism on antimycobacterial activity. Comparison to previously published isosteric N-pyrazinylbenzamides was made as an attempt to draw structure-activity relationships in such type of compounds. In total, we prepared 44 different compounds, out of which fourteen had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra below 31.25 µg/ml, most promising being N-(5-chloropyridin-2-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide (23) and N-(6-chloropyridin-2-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide (24) with MIC = 7.81 µg/ml (26 µm). Five compounds showed broad-spectrum antimycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis H37Ra, M. smegmatis and M. aurum. N-(pyridin-2-yl)benzamides were generally more active than N-(pyridin-3-yl)benzamides, indicating that N-1 in the parental structure of N-pyrazinylbenzamides might be more important for antimycobacterial activity than N-4. Marginal antibacterial and antifungal activity was observed for title compounds. The hepatotoxicity of title compounds was assessed in vitro on hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, and they may be considered non-toxic (22 compounds with IC50 over 200 µm).
