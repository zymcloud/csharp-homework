Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious threat to human lives and is usually diagnosed at the late stages. Recently, there has been a rapid advancement in the treatment options for HCC, but novel therapeutic targets are still needed, especially for precision medicine.Aims:We aimed to investigate the involvement of non-coding RNA RP11-81H3.2 in HCC.Methods:The expression of RP11-81H3.2 was examined in the blood samples of HCC patients, and in the human HCC cell lines, including HepG2, Smmc-7721, and Huh7. Cell proliferation was determined using the CCK-8 and EdU assay, and cell invasion and migration were determined using the transwell/wound healing assay. The effects of RP11-81H3.2 knockdown on in vivo tumor growth were evaluated utilizing the nude mice HepG2 tumor xenograft model.Results:Here, we have identified a long non-coding RNA, RP11-81H3.2, which is enriched in HCC and can promote its proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, our results showed that RP11-81H3.2 binds to and regulate miR-490-3p expression in the HCC cells. Moreover, we found that RP11-81H3.2 regulates the expression of TNKS2 via miR-490-3p. Further, we found that RP11-81H3.2 and miR-490-3p form a regulatory loop; the release of RP11-81H3.2 leads to the suppression of miR-490-3p expression, thus, further enhancing the expression of RP11-81H3.2.Conclusions:Our data have provided a novel target for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC, and sheds light on the lncRNA-miRNA regulatory nexus that can control the HCC related pathogenesis.
