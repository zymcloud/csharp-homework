Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 85% of all cases of liver cancer. In China, chronic hepatitis B virus-related HCC (HBV-related HCC) is the most common type of HCC. However, the majority of HBV-related HCC patients are asymptomatic, and the best opportunities for treating these patients are missed. The precise diagnosis of HBV-related HCC is crucial. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of murine double minute-2 (MDM2) promoter methylation in HBV-related HCC patients. Methods: The methylation status of the MDM2 promoter was detected by methylation-specific PCR. The MDM2 expression levels were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in plasma. Results: The methylation frequency of the MDM2 promoter was decreased in HBV-related HCC patients. The MDM2 mRNA levels of patients with HBV-related HCC were higher than those of patients with liver cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B. The plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly higher in HBV-related HCC patients than that in liver cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B patients. The TNF-α levels were higher in the unmethylated MDM2 promoter group than in the methylated MDM2 promoter group in HBV-related HCC patients. Moreover, the combination of MDM2 promoter methylation and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) improved the diagnosis of HBV-related HCC. Conclusions: Our study indicates, for the first time, that MDM2 promoter hypomethylation is present in HBV-related HCC patients. The combination of MDM2 promoter methylation and AFP can greatly improve diagnostic efficiency in HBV-related HCC, which might provide a new method for HBV-related HCC diagnosis.
