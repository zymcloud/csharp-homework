Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is still one of the main causes of liver disease worldwide. Metabolic disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), induced by HCV have been shown to accelerate the progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis and to increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. An optimal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A) activity is crucial to prevent NAFLD installation. The present study aims to investigate the associations between two common PPARGC1A polymorphisms (rs8192678 and rs12640088) and the outcomes of HCV infection in a North African context. A series of 592 consecutive Moroccan subjects, including 292 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), 100 resolvers and 200 healthy controls were genotyped using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. PPARGC1A variations at rs8192678 and rs12640088 were not associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection (adjusted ORs = 0.76 and 0.79 respectively, P > 0.05, for both). Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that both SNPs were not associated with fibrosis progression (OR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.20-2.49; P = 0.739; OR = 1.28; 95% CI 0.25-6.54; P = 0.512, respectively). We conclude that, in the genetic context of South Mediterranean patients, rs8192678 and rs12640088 polymorphisms of PPARGC1A are neither associated with spontaneous clearance nor with disease progression in individuals infected with HCV.
