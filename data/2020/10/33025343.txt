Lenvatinib is a standard molecular targeted agent for the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we report a case of colitis induced by Lenvatinib treatment in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. A 78-year-old man previously treated with Lenvatinib for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma was admitted to our hospital complaining of right lateral abdominal pain without diarrhea. Our endoscopic findings showed multiple ulcers and erosions on his ascending colon, and he was diagnosed with colitis induced by Lenvatinib treatment. After the discontinuation of Lenvatinib, his colitis improved, and he resumed Lenvatinib at a lower dose. Colitis is a rare adverse event of Lenvatinib, and this is the first detailed report of colitis induced by Lenvatinib with endoscopic findings.
