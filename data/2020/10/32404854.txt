Purpose:The current study aims to investigate the effect of tumor suppressor LHPP-associated microRNA (miR)-765 on the prognosis of laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) or open hepatectomy (OH) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:A total of 160 patients with HCC were enrolled and randomly divided into the LH or OH group. According to the operation time, these patients were followed up for 12 months, and the number of deaths and the corresponding death time during the follow-up period were counted.Results:The authors found that the LHPP gene levels in HCC tissues were lower than that in adjacent normal tissues, whereas miR-765 was overexpressed in HCC tissue. Overexpression of miR-765 promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of HCC through directly downregulating LHPP expression. Serum miR-765 expression level was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and histologic grading. Survival analysis showed that the overall survival rate in 12 months after the operation was significantly lower in the OH-high miR-765 group (PConclusion:For patients with a low miR-765 level, both LH and OH are available, otherwise, LH is more recommended.
