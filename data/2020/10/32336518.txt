Background:The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system is widely applied to stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it may be inaccurate when applied to East Asian HCC patients. In this study, a large Chinese HCC cohort was analyzed to evaluate possible modifications for the BCLC staging system.Methods:Between January 1995 and December 2009, 622 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were enrolled. Prognostic risk factors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. The ability of the modified system to predict survival was evaluated by determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.Results:Patients without bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT; 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival, 80%, 60% and 48%, respectively) showed a substantial survival advantage over those with BDTT (1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival, 77%, 42% and 23%, respectively; χ2 = 6.280, P = 0.012). In BCLC stage 0-A patients, significant differences were identified between the BDTT group and the non-BDTT group, while no such differences were found in BCLC stage B patients. Based on this finding, BCLC stage 0-A BDTT patients were recategorized into stage B. The modified BCLC classification featured better performance in the prediction of overall survival than the original system (modified BCLC χ2 = 53.596, P < 0.001; original BCLC χ2 = 46.335, P < 0.001). The ability to predict mortality was also slightly higher using the modified BCLC system.Conclusions:Modification of the BCLC system to include BDTT status might further enhance its prognostic ability.
