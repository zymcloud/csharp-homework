Purpose:To assess the imaging findings of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as a bridging therapy prior to liver transplantation (LT), with histopathological correlation at liver explant.Methods:Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study. The study subjects included 25 HCC lesions in 23 patients (20 males; median age, 60 years; range 41-68 years) who underwent LT after SBRT for HCC as a bridge to LT in a single tertiary referral institution over a 12-year period. Target HCC lesions were assessed for imaging biomarkers on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI including change in HCC diameter and assessment of percentage necrosis. The radiologic response at pre-LT imaging was compared to explant pathology.Results:There was a positive correlation between the tumor size (Spearman's ρ = 0.86; p Conclusion:RECIST 1.1 radiologic response criteria may underestimate the response to treatment with SBRT, and radiologic estimation of percent tumor necrosis was more closely correlated with pathologic percent tumor necrosis.
