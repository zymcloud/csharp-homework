Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive and innovative therapeutic approach which has been increasingly applied in clinical cancer therapy. As the central element of PDT, the development of novel photosensitizers (PSs) with longer absorption wavelength, proper lipophilic/hydrophilic profiles, target tissue selectivity, and higher photo-/lowest dark-cytotoxicity is a challenging task. Previously, we designed and synthesized a series of novel long-wavelength chlorin e6 (Ce6)-based PSs via introducing aromatic groups to the vinyl of Ce6 skeleton. The new formed compounds with π-extension system exhibited improved photodynamic effects and spectral characteristics. Among these π-conjugated chlorin PSs, (E)-32-(4-methoxyphenyl)-chlorin e6, named A15, was expected to be a potent antitumor candidate as a PDT agent due to its good photobiological properties. Herein, in this work, we evaluated the effectiveness of A15 in cancer PDT. In vitro, a novel rare earth probe, ATTA-Eu3+ was applied to detect the singlet oxygen (1O2) production of A15 in solution and human hepatoma HepG2 cells, respectively. Moreover, A15 exhibited strong phototoxicity and weak dark cytotoxity to HepG2 cells. In H22 tumor bearing mice, A15 showed excellent tumor accumulation ability via i.v. administration and induced tumor regression, followed by laser treatment. These results indicated that A15 is a potential novel π-extension chlorin-type PS for PDT applications.
