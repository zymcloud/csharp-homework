With the rapid expansion of the obesity epidemic, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now the most common chronic liver disease, with almost 25% global prevalence. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ranges in severity from simple steatosis, a benign 'pre-disease' state, to the liver injury and inflammation that characterize nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which in turn predisposes individuals to liver fibrosis. Fibrosis is the major determinant of clinical outcomes in patients with NASH and is associated with increased risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH has no approved therapies, and liver fibrosis shows poor response to existing pharmacotherapy, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Patient and mouse data have shown that NASH is associated with the activation of developmental pathways: Notch, Hedgehog and Hippo-YAP-TAZ. Although these evolutionarily conserved fundamental signals are known to determine liver morphogenesis during development, new data have shown a coordinated and causal role for these pathways in the liver injury response, which becomes maladaptive during obesity-associated chronic liver disease. In this Review, we discuss the aetiology of this reactivation of developmental pathways and review the cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms by which developmental pathways influence disease progression. Finally, we discuss the potential prognostic and therapeutic implications of these data for NASH and liver fibrosis.
