The rising tide of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with the obesity epidemic is a major international health concern. NAFLD is the leading global cause of liver disease with an estimated prevalence of 25% and is the fastest growing indication for liver transplantation (LT). The presence and severity of liver fibrosis is the only histologic predictor of clinical outcomes in this group. NAFLD poses several challenges in the peri-transplant setting including the management of multiple metabolic co-morbidities, post-transplant obesity and cardiovascular risk. However, post-LT outcomes in well-selected NAFLD patients appear similar to non-NAFLD indications, including in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The rising prevalence of NAFLD may impact potential liver graft donors, which may in-turn adversely affect post-LT outcomes. This review outlines the current epidemiology, natural history and outcomes of NAFLD with a focus on pre- and post-liver transplant settings.
