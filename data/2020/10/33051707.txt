Background and aims:Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a non-thermal ablation technique for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not amenable to standard thermal ablation. The aim of this study was to report our longer-term outcomes using this treatment modality.Method:We identified all patients at our institution who underwent IRE for HCC between December 2008 and October 2019 as recommended after multi-disciplinary team review. Demographic, clinical, tumour response and survival data up until 1 March, 2020 were analysed. The primary outcome was local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) in patients who had a complete response (CR). Secondary outcomes included CR rates, procedure-related complications and the incidence of death or liver transplantation.Results:A total of 23 patients (78% males, median age 65.2 years) received IRE therapy to 33 HCC lesions during the study period with the median tumour size being 2.0 cm (range 1.0-5.0 cm). Twenty-nine (87.9%) lesions were successfully ablated after one (n = 26) or two (n = 3) procedures. The median follow-up time for these lesions was 20.4 months. The median overall LRFS was 34.5 (95% CI 24.8 -) months with a 6- and 12-month LRFS of 87.9% (95% CI 75.8-100) and 83.6% (95% CI 70.2-99.7), respectively. Tumours Conclusion:IRE appears to be an efficacious local ablative method for early stage HCC not amenable to standard ablative techniques, with very good CR rates and longer-term LRFS, particularly for smaller lesions. Further studies comparing this technique to more widely accepted ablative methods such as radiofrequency and microwave ablation are warranted.
