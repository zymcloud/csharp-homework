Anemia is a common chronic kidney disease (CKD) complication contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Collagen-based traditional Chinese nutraceuticals have long been used in antianemic therapies. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of porcine collagen hydrolysate (CH) and its underlying mechanism in the treatment of renal anemia by using adenine-induced CKD mice, RAW264.7 macrophages, and HepG2 hepatoma cells, with prolyl-hydroxyproline as a reference compound for collagen-derived hydroxyproline-containing di-/tripeptides. CH was found to alleviate renal filtering dysfunction, systemic and kidney inflammation, liver hepcidin overproduction and anemia and to increase erythropoietin production and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-2α stability in liver and kidney in CKD mice. Prolyl-hydroxyproline exerted direct anti-inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages and elicited stimulating and inhibiting activities on erythropoietin expression and hepcidin overproduction, respectively, in HepG2 cells by HIF-2α activation. Overall, CH was effective in correcting renal anemia via anti-inflammatory renoprotection and HIF-2α-dependent erythropoietin and hepcidin regulation.
