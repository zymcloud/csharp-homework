Modern liver surgeon must be equipped with excellent theoretical and clinical skills to perform a perfect liver resection. A particular and growing relevance is devoted to parenchyma sparing liver surgery (PSS). Indeed, reducing the sacrifice of functioning parenchyma is one of the keys of a successful surgery, once oncological issues are properly addressed. Intraoperative ultrasound together with oncological and anatomical new insights have enhanced the possibility to offer PSS even in advanced disease usually afforded with major resections or staged procedures or even considered unresectable. These complex hepatectomies are mainly performed with open surgery, while major or staged procedures could be faced with minimal access liver surgery (MALS): that is generating a potential conflict between open PSS and MALS major hepatectomies. An overall evaluation of oncological radicality, safety, salvageability, and quality of life suggest to prioritize PSS, which is always minimal invasive liver surgery in a hepatic-centered perspective, while MALS is not.
