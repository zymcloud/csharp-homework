Background & aims:Tumour mutational burden (TMB) predicts improved response and survival to immunotherapy. In this pilot study, we optimized targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) to estimate TMB in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We sequenced 48 non-paired samples (21 fresh-frozen [FF] and 27 paraffin-embedded [FFPE]), among which 11 FFPE samples were pretreated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG). Thirty samples satisfied post-sequencing quality control. High/low TMB was defined by median number of mutations/Mb (Mut/Mb), across different minimum allele frequency (MAF) thresholds (≥0.05, ≥0.1 and ≥0.2).Results:Eligible patients (n = 29) were cirrhotic (84%) with TNM stage I-II HCC (75%). FFPE samples had higher TMB (median 958.39 vs 2.51 Mut/Mb, P T transitions at CpG sites (median 60.3% vs 9.1%, P = .002) compared to FF. UDG-treated samples had lower TMB (median 4019.92 vs 353 Mut/Mb, P = .041) and deamination counts (median 6393.5 vs 328.5, P = .041) vs untreated FFPE. At 0.2 MAF threshold with UDG treatment, median TMB was 5.48 (range 1.68-16.07) and did not correlate with salient pathologic features of HCC, including survival.Conclusion:While tNGS on fresh HCC samples appears to be the optimal source of tumour DNA, the low median TMB values observed may limit the role of TMB as a predictor of response to immunotherapy in HCC.
