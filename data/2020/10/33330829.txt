Lausanne University Hospital is in the Francophone part of Switzerland and services a catchment population of about 1 million people. We recorded and analyzed baseline characteristics and surgical outcomes for 400 consecutive patients who underwent liver resection there between January 2014 and February 2020. Their pathological results were primary liver cancer (including hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma): 21.8%, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (including perihilar cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer): 5.3%, liver metastases: 51.8%, echinococcosis: 10.8%, adenoma: 3.0%, and other diagnoses: 7.5%. Global morbidity rate (Clavien-Dindo classification ≥ 1) was 45.5% with major complication (Clavien-Dindo classification ≥ 3) identified in 81 patients (20.3%). Of the 400 patients, two died within 30 days of surgery (0.5%) and five died within 90 days (1.3%). The 2017-2019 subgroup had a significantly greater percentage of patients aged ≥ 75 years (20.5%) than did the 2014-2016 subgroup (10.9%; p = 0.011) and a higher percentage of laparoscopic procedures than the earlier subgroup (2014-2016: 9.2%, 2017-2019: 32.5%; p < 0.001). We conclude that as the patient population ages, preoperative management and surgical techniques should be constantly improved.
