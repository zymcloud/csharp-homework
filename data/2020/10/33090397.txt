Objective:MicroRNA-329-3p (miR-329-3p) has been shown to be involved in tumor development. But its role in hepatocellular carcinoma has not been explored. Our study aims to explore the effect and mechanism of miR-329-3p on hepatocellular carcinoma development.Patients and methods:Hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and paired paracancerous specimens from 31 hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing surgery were collected. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were employed to measure genes expression at mRNA and protein level. CCK-8 and transwell assays were performed to evaluate hepatocellular carcinoma cells proliferation and migration. Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay was designed to validate the target gene of miR-329-3p.Results:Our study showed miR-329-3p expression was significantly lower in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue. MiR-329-3p mimic inhibits proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells. By using Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay, we proved that miR-329-3p inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation and migration by targeting USP22 directly. By up- and downregulation of USP22 expression, we also proved that USP22 can activate the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway, which in turn affected the proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells.Conclusions:We demonstrated that miR-329-3p can inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation and migration by inhibiting USP22-Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. Our study provides novel insights into the aetiology and potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
