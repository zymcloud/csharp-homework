Purpose:The recurrence after curative hepatectomy is common. Limited data have investigated the effect of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with ablation in treating recurrent intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy. We aim to compare the efficacy of TACE combined with ablation versus TACE alone in treating recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after hepatectomy.Methods:A total of 183 patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after hepatectomy were enrolled at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Centre, including 111 patients who underwent TACE alone and 72 patients who underwent TACE combined with ablation (TACE-Ablation). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared by the log-rank test. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce the confounding bias.Results:Before PSM, the 5-year OS rates were 43.3% vs. 27.9% (P = 0.001), and the 5-year PFS rates were 21.7% vs. 13.0% (P Conclusion:TACE combined with ablation is safe and superior to TACE alone in tumour control and prolonging overall survival in recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after hepatectomy.
