Purpose:To assess the technical feasibility of MRI/CT image fusion and completeness of ablation treatment for primary or metastatic liver lesions invisible on contrast-enhanced CT planning scans and outcome in patients treated with stereotactic microwave ablation (SMWA).Materials and methods:The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Patients who underwent SMWA between January 2015 and December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. All liver lesions for which MRI/CT fusion was performed due to invisibility on pre-interventional CT planning scans were included and reassessed. The outcome measurement was successful ablation of the lesion at first follow-up imaging.Results:During the study period, 236 patients underwent 312 SMWAs with ablation of 496 lesions. Twenty-four lesions in 15 patients (mean age, 62 years; range, 43-80 years) were included. Following MRI/CT image fusion, all 24 lesions could be sufficiently localized to perform SMWA. The first follow-up imaging showed complete ablation of 22 lesions. Two initially incompletely ablated lesions were hepatocellular carcinomas and were successfully re-ablated afterwards.Conclusion:SMWA with MRI/CT image fusion is an accurate and safe treatment option for patients with liver lesions not detectable on contrast-enhanced CT planning scans. MRI/CT image fusion may allow more patients with malignant liver lesions to benefit from local ablation treatment even if their lesions are not visible on CT planning examinations.
