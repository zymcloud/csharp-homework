There is increasing evidence that nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the absence of cirrhosis, a phenomenon termed noncirrhotic HCC. Early diagnosis of HCC is critical to a favorable prognosis. We tested the hypothesis that hydroxyproline content of liver biopsy samples is diagnostic for HCC in murine models of NASH induced by diet or by diet and chemicals. The training set comprised mice fed a standard diet or a fast-food diet with or without administration of thioacetamide. At harvest, livers from the modified diet cohort exhibited NASH with a subset of NASH livers exhibiting HCC. Hydroxyproline content was measured in liver biopsy samples with tissue in the NASH+HCC cohort sampled from the remote, nontumor parenchyma. Plotting the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) with hydroxyproline as the continuous variable against the absence or presence of HCC yielded an area under ROC of 0.87, a threshold of >0.18 Î¼g hydroxyproline/mg liver and sensitivity of 91% with a specificity of 83.3%. The use of liver hydroxyproline content as a diagnostic for HCC in a test set comprising healthy, NASH and NASH+HCC livers proved 87% accurate.
