Precancerous lesions are the intermediate stage in the development of liver cancer from cirrhosis. Early intervention measures can effectively prevent the occurrence of liver cancer and prolong the lives of patients, resulting in greater economic effects. Erzhu Jiedu decoction (EJD) is a semiempirical formula that is used in the treatment of cirrhosis and liver cancer according to the academic philosophy of "Preventive treatment of disease" and has achieved good curative effects in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of EJD on liver precancerous lesions induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) in rats. The results showed that EJD improved the general conditions (body weight, ALT, AST, and GGT) and reduced the number of precancerous lesions in the rat model. Notably, the medium dose of EJD (1.05 g/kg) had better treatment effects than the low dose of EJD, and the high dose of EJD did not further improve the liver lesions compared to the medium dose of EJD. Moreover, EJD effectively reduced the DEN-induced GST-Pi, AFP, CK19, c-Myc, and Ki67 protein expression in liver precancerous tissues. Interestingly, EJD significantly reduced YAP and TAZ mRNA expression in the liver precancerous lesions. Collectively, EJD protects against in the initiation of liver cancer and the regulation of c-Myc and Hippo signaling pathways may be the underlying mechanism.
