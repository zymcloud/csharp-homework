Objective: To investigate the value of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI in evaluating liver function and predicting the risk of post-hepatoectomy liver failure in patients with major resection of liver cancer. Methods: A total number of 212 patients were included from June 2016 to June 2019 at Department of General Surgery, Peking University Third Hospital with a retrospectively collected data.All patients underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI for diagnosis and preoperative evaluation of liver function.There were 135 males and 77 females, with age of (63.1Â±10.3) years old (range: 18 to 86 years old) . Relative enhancement ratio (RER) of the region of interest on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI was acquired by two independent researcher and then conducted the comparison of RER among the patients with or without post-hepatoectomy liver failure (PHLF) .Preoperative evaluation demonstrated that 141 cases infected by hepatitis virus, 128 cases with hepatitis B alone and 11 cases with hepatitis C alone, 2 cases had both of hepatitis B and C, and all patients were grade A judged by Child-Pugh score. The relationship between RER and PHLF was evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis and the diagnostic value of RER in predicting PHLF was test by receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: PHLF occurred in 42 patients according to ISGLS standard. Among them, 31 cases had level A liver failure, 9 cases had level B liver failure and 2 had level C failure. There was a significant correlation between RER and overall level of PHLF and RER was also significantly associated with severe B to C level of PHLF (P<0.05) .The further receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed that the diagnostic accuracy of RER on overall PHLF was 0.818 (sensitivity 72.9%, specificity 83.3%, cut-off value 73.5%, 95%CI: 0.75 to 0.887) and on severe PHLF was 0.924 (sensitivity 97.0%, specificity 90.9%, cut-off value: 61.5%, 95%CI: 0.79 to 0.90) . Conclusion: For patients who planned to undergo major resection of liver cancer, preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI can help with the assessment of liver function and predicting the risk for post-hepatectomy liver failure.
