This retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and safety of high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation for primary liver cancer and metastatic liver cancer. Patients with liver cancer who received high-intensity focused ultrasound were included in this analysis, including a primary liver cancer cohort (n=80) and a metastatic liver cancer cohort (n=195). The primary endpoint of our research was tumor response. The secondary endpoints included survival outcomes, visual analog scale pain scores, alpha-fetoprotein relief, and complications. Objective response rate and disease control rate were observed to be 71.8% and 81.2%, respectively, in patients with primary liver cancer and were 63.7% and 83.2% in cases with metastatic liver cancer. Alpha-fetoprotein levels and visual analogue scale levels significantly decreased after treatment compared with the baseline levels in patients with primary liver cancer (p<0.05). Median overall survival was estimated to be 13.0 and 12.0 months in the primary liver cancer and metastatic liver cancer cohorts. The 1-year survival rate was 70.69% and 48.00%, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed that visual analogue scale ≥ 5, longest diameter ≥ 5 cm, and portal vein invasion were the independent risk factors for poor survival in primary liver cancer. For patients with metastatic liver cancer, independent risk factors were identified as visual analogue scale ≥ 5, longest diameter ≥ 5 cm, existence of extrahepatic metastases, existence of portal vein invasion, and time to high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment from diagnosis < 3 months. Severe adverse events were rarely reported. In conclusion, high-intensity focused ultrasound might be an effective and safe option for patients with liver cancer regardless of primary and metastatic lesions.
