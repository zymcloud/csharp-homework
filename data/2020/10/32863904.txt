Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a challenge in the medical field due to its high malignancy and mortality rates particularly for HCC, which has developed multidrug resistance. Therefore, the identification of efficient chemotherapeutic drugs for multidrug resistant HCC has become an urgent issue. Natural products have always been of significance in drug discovery. In the present study, a cell-based method was used to screen a natural compound library, which consisted of 78 compounds, and the doxorubicin-resistant cancer cell line, HepG2/ADM, as screening tools. The findings of the present study led to the shortlisting of one of the compounds, digitoxin, which displayed an inhibitory effect on HepG2/ADM cells, with 50% inhibitory concentration values of 132.65±3.83, 52.29±6.26, and 9.13±3.67 nM for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Immunofluorescence, western blotting and cell cycle analyses revealed that digitoxin induced G2/M cell cycle arrest via the serine/threonine-protein kinase ATR (ATR)-serine/threonine-protein kinase Chk2 (CHK2)-M-phase inducer phosphatase 3 (CDC25C) signaling pathway in HepG2/ADM cells, which may have resulted from a DNA double-stranded break. Digitoxin also induced mitochondrial apoptosis, which was characterized by changes in the interaction between Bcl-2 and Bax, the release of cytochrome c, as well as the activation of the caspase-3 and -9. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report that digitoxin displays an anti-HCC effect on HepG2/ADM cells through G2/M cell cycle arrest, which was mediated by the ATR-CHK2-CDC25C signaling pathway and mitochondrial apoptosis. Therefore, digitoxin could be a promising chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with HCC.
