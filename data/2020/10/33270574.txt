Liver cancer is a highly lethal cancer, in which local tumor microenvironment and systemic immune suppression allow tumor to escape immune surveillance. Intervening in tumor microenvironment by locoregional treatment options can be beneficial for patients. We aimed to study changes in serum cytokines levels due to local disturbance of tumor microenvironment after radiofrequency thermal ablation procedure compare to liver resection in patients with primary and metastatic liver cancer. A total of 17 patients with primary (HCC and Cholangiocarcinoma) and secondary (metastatic) liver cancer were enrolled in this prospective study. Out of 17 patients, 7 were referred to RFA procedure and another 10 underwent surgical liver resection using non-RF based devices. Blood samples were collected from each patient before and after 1 and 3 months of treatment. The following serum cytokines: IL-10, IL-17, INF-γ, TGF-β were assayed by ELISA (ebiosciences, USA). RFA procedure unlike liver resection decreased serum level of IL-10 in patients with liver cancer. No significant changes in the level of the studied cytokines were revealed.
