Background and aims:Recently, a simple score (GES score) combining biochemical and clinical variables was found to predict HCC in hepatitis C (HCV) genotype 4 Egyptian patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3-4) and a sustained virological response (SVR) to direct-acting antivirals (DAA). Our aim was to investigate GES score performance in a large cohort of European HCV cirrhotic patients of any HCV genotype.Methods:Consecutive HCV cirrhotics achieving an SVR to DAA treatment performed between December 2014 and May 2019 in a single center were included. GES score was calculated from clinical and biochemical parameters assessed at the time of SVR.Results:A total of 577 HCV cirrhotic patients were included: median age was 64 years, 58% males, 17% diabetics, median Liver Stiffness Measurement (LSM) was 17.3 kPa, albumin 4.1 g/dl, alpha-fetoprotein 9 ng/mL. HCV genotype was 1 in 62%, cirrhosis was compensated in 89% of the patients. During a median follow-up of 52 (8-68) months, 46 (8%) patients developed de-novo HCC, corresponding to a 5-year estimated cumulative incidence (CumI) of 9.3% (95% CI 7-12%). According to the different HCC risk profiles identified by GES score, the 5-year CumI of HCC was 4.7% (95% CI 1-9%) in the low, 10% (95% CI 5-14%) in the intermediate and 13.8% in the high-risk group (p=0.01), however, the 5-year risk was similar between intermediate and high-risk groups (p=0.20).Conclusions:In a large single center cohort of consecutive European SVR cirrhotics with any HCV genotype, GES score displayed suboptimal HCC risk stratification.
