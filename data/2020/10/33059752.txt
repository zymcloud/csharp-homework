Lineage tracing is the most widely used technique to track the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of specific cells in vivo. The currently available gene-targeting technologies have been developing for decades to study organogenesis, tissue injury repairing, and tumor progression by tracing the fates of individual cells. Recently, lineage tracing has expanded the platforms available for disease model establishment, drug screening, cell plasticity research, and personalized medicine development in a molecular and cellular biology perspective. Lineage tracing provides new views for exploring digestive organ development and regeneration and techniques for digestive disease causes and progression. This review focuses on the lineage tracing technology and its application in digestive diseases.
