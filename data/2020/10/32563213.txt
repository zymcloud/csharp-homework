Introduction:Regorafenib is an approved agent in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who progressed on sorafenib, but little is known about its clinical outcomes in Child-Pugh B patients. We aimed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of regorafenib in Child-Pugh B HCC patients.Methods:This multicentre retrospective study included 59 patients with Child-Pugh B HCC who received regorafenib. Comparative analyses were performed with an independent cohort of Child-Pugh class A patients from the same registry (n = 440).Results:The median age was 58 years (range, 19-83). All patients had progression on prior sorafenib. Regorafenib was given as 2nd line, and 3rd-4th line systemic therapy in 37 (62.7%) and 22 (37.3%) patients respectively. Compared to Child-Pugh A cohort, grade 3-4 AEs were more common in the Child-Pugh B cohort (27.1% vs 14.1%, P = .017). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 1.8 and 4.6 months, respectively, and these were significantly poorer than the Child-Pugh A cohort (P = .008 and P Conclusion:Regorafenib's poor clinical outcomes and increased frequency of severe adverse events lead us to discourage its use in the Child-Pugh B population. In particular, regorafenib should not be used in Child-Pugh B patients with ALBI grade 3.
