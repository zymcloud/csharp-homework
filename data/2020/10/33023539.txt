Background:Nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFAT2) has been reported to regulate the development and malignancy of few tumors. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of NFAT2 expression on cell fate of HepG2 cell and its potential mechanisms.Methods:Firstly, the pcDNA3.1-NFAT2 plasmid was transfected into HepG2 cells to construct NFAT2 overexpressed HepG2 cells. Then, the chemical count kit-8 cell viability assay, Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection, EdU labeling proliferation detection, transwell and wound healing experiments were performed. The expression of Egr2 and FasL, and the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, after ionomycin and PMA co-stimulation, was detected, while the Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by K+ solution was determined. At last, the mRNA and protein expression of NFAT2, Egr2, FasL, COX-2 and c-myc in carcinoma and adjacent tissues was investigated.Results:The NFAT2 overexpression suppressed the cell viability, invasion and migration capabilities, and promoted apoptosis of HepG2 cells. NFAT2 overexpression induced the expression of Egr2 and FasL and suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK. The sensitivity and Ca2+ mobilization of HepG2 cells was also inhibited by NFAT2 overexpression. Compared with adjacent tissues, the carcinoma tissues expressed less NFAT2, Egr2, FasL and more COX-2 and c-myc.Conclusion:The current study firstly suggested that NFAT2 suppressed the aggression and malignancy of HepG2 cells through inducing the expression of Egr2. The absence of NFAT2 and Egr2 in carcinoma tissues reminded us that NFAT2 may be a promising therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
