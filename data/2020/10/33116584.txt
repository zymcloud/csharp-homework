Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for more than 90% of liver cancers and is ranked as the fifth most common malignancy. Androgen receptor (AR) may promote the progression of HCC at an early stage of the disease. However, this study identified miR-135b-5p as an AR upstream regulator can suppress AR protein expression and inhibit HCC proliferation, consistent with the idea that AR expression is negatively correlated with HCC progression.Methods:The target microRNAs were predicted using online databases (TargetScan, miRDB, and MicroCosm Targets). Cell proliferation ability was measured by MTT and colony formation assay. Western blot was performed to analyze the expression levels of AR, HIF-2α, c-Myc, and p27, which are related to HCC proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and luciferase reporter assay were carried out to investigate the mechanism by which miR-135b-5p decreases AR expression.Results:miR-135b-5p suppresses HCC cell proliferation and AR expression. Downregulation of AR expression by miR-135b-5p may in turn transcriptionally modulate HIF-2α expression via direct binding of AR to the androgen response element (ARE) in the HIF-2α promoter. Further dissection of the mechanism revealed that AR-modulated HIF-2α could suppress c-Myc expression resulting in increased p27 expression that likely contributes to the suppression of proliferation in HCC cells.Conclusion:miR-135b-5p suppresses HCC cell proliferation via targeting AR-modulated HIF-2α/c-Myc/p27 signals, which may help to develop more effective therapies to prevent HCC progression.
