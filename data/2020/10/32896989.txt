The role of the LMNA gene in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the associated molecular mechanism is not yet clear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between LMNA and HCC. LMNA gene expression in normal tissues and corresponding tumours was evaluated and the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Next, the LMNA gene was knocked out in the 293T and HepG2 cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. Subsequently, the proliferation, migration and colony formation rate of the two LMNA knockout cell lines were analysed. Finally, the molecular mechanism affecting the tumorigenesis due to the loss of the LMNA gene was evaluated. The results showed that the LMNA gene was abnormally expressed in many tumours, and the survival rate of the HCC patients with a high expression of the LMNA gene was significantly reduced compared with the rate in patients with a low LMNA expression. The knockout of the LMNA gene in the HCC cell line HepG2 resulted in a decreased tumorigenicity, up-regulation of the P16 expression and down-regulation of the CDK1 expression. These findings suggested that LMNA might function as an oncogene in HCC and provided a potential new target for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.
