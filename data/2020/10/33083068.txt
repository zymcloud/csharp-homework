In this report, the case of a 24-year-old female with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) who was diagnosed with well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is described. While BWS has been associated with childhood embryonal tumors, most commonly Wilms tumors and hepatoblastomas, this is the first case report to describe HCC in an adult with BWS. Although HCC typically occurs in elderly adults or those with underlying liver disease, in this case, we show that HCC can occur in a young adult with BWS without any underlying liver disease.
