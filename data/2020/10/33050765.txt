Objective:To determine if iodine-125 seed implantation improved the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (≤5 cm).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 83 consecutive patients with HCC (≤5 cm) who underwent TACE or TACE-iodine-125 from January 2014 to July 2017. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) at 3 months after the first TACE treatment. PFS and OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank tests. Independent risk factors for PFS and OS were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model.Results:Thirty-five patients received TACE-iodine-125 and 48 received TACE alone. The median OS and PFS were both significantly longer in the TACE-iodine-125 compared with the TACE-alone group (42 vs 23 months and 16 vs 8 months, respectively). The ORR was significantly higher in the TACE-iodine-125 compared with the TACE-alone group. There was no significant difference in adverse events, apart from decreased white cell count, between the two groups.Conclusion:TACE-iodine-125 might be an effective and safe alternative treatment for patients with HCC (≤5 cm).
