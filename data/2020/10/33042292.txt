Aims:This essay explores the anti-cancer activity of specific Chinese herbal medicines to clarify how effective Chinese herbal medicine is used for handling hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Literature form publica domain were studied and an analysis of anti-cancer activity of specific Chinese herbal medicines is presented in this review.Results:Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most dangerous malignant tumors in the world. The operative diagnosis of liver cancer remains a significant challenge. Although surgery tissue resection is encouraging, a high risk of recurrence and metastasis, illustrating disease-related mortality is desperately required to enhance postoperative preventive and therapeutic clinical procedures. The almost only effective clinical intervention seems to be developing advanced targeted therapies such as sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma patients, but there is little research in this field. Because their preventative/therapeutic properties strengthen Chinese herbal medicinal compounds, they are deemed relevant to the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion: Chinese herbal medicine derivates provide multifaceted, orientated and orchestrated therapy, making it an ideal candidate for inhibiting hepatocellular tumor production and metastasis.
