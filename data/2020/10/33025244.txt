Objective:There is no standardized and objective method for determining the optimal treatment endpoint (sub-stasis) during transarterial embolization. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a quantitative digital subtraction angiography (qDSA) technique to characterize intra-procedural changes in hepatic arterial blood flow velocity in response to transarterial embolization in an in vivo porcine model.Materials and methods:Eight domestic swine underwent bland transarterial embolizations to partial- and sub-stasis angiographic endpoints with intraprocedural DSA acquisitions. Embolized lobes were assessed on histopathology for ischemic damage and tissue embolic particle density. Analysis of target vessels used qDSA and a commercially available color-coded DSA (ccDSA) tool to calculate blood flow velocities and time-to-peak, respectively.Results:Blood flow velocities calculated using qDSA showed a statistically significant difference (p Conclusions:qDSA was able to quantitatively discriminate angiographic embolization endpoints and, compared to a commercially available ccDSA method, improve intra-procedural characterization of blood flow changes. Additionally, the qDSA endpoints correlated with tissue-level changes.
