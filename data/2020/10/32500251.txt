Purpose:To compare Lipiodol uptake and tumor response in intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with and without pre-embolization vascular lake phenomenon (VLP) and to identify the incidence and predictive factors of this phenomenon, in patients treated by conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE).Materials and methods:This retrospective study included 151 consecutive patients with intermediate HCC totaling 232 nodules, who underwent cTACE from June 2015 to October 2018. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of VLP before embolization. Initial Lipiodol uptake was assessed using post-cTACE computed tomography (CT) within 1-1.5 months after cTACE. Enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 6 months after the procedure to assess local recurrence and distant metastasis.Results:The VLP was demonstrated in 21.85% (33/151) patients and 16.81% (39/232) nodules on the super-selective angiography. On nodule-based analysis, significantly better Lipiodol uptake (p Conclusion:The incidence of VLP before embolization is 21.19%. The presence of VLP is well correlated with tumor Lipiodol uptake after cTACE and may be a new predictive factor for evaluation of cTACE efficacy and prognosis of intermediate HCC.
