Aim:To evaluate the feasibility and potential value of two-dimensional (2D) parametric parenchymal blood flow (2D-PPBF) for the assessment of perfusion changes during transarterial chemoembolisation with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) and to analyse correlations of 2D-PPBF parameters and tumour response.Materials and methods:Thirty-two patients (six women, 26 men, mean age: 67±8.9 years) with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent their first DEB-TACE were included in this study. To quantify perfusion changes using 2D-PPBF, the acquired digital subtraction angiography (DSA) series were post-processed. Ratios were calculated between the reference region of interest (ROI) and the wash-in rate (WIR), the arrival to peak (AP) and the area under the curve (AUC) of the generated time-density curves. Comparisons between pre- and post-embolisation data were made using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Tumour response was assessed at 3 months using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (mRECIST) and correlated to changes of 2D-PPBF parameters.Results:All 2D-PPBF parameters derived from the ROI-based time-attenuation curves were significantly different pre-versus post-DEB-TACE. Although the AUC, the WIR and target lesion size measured in accordance with mRECIST decreased (p≤0.0001) significantly, AP values showed a significant increase (p = 0.0033). Tumour response after DEB-TACE correlated with changes in the AUC (p = 0.01, r = -0.45).Conclusion:2D-PPBF offers an objective approach to analyse perfusion changes of embolised tumour tissue following DEB-TACE and can therefore be used to predict tumour response.
