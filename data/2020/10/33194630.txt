Background: Preoperative grading of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important factor associated with prognosis after liver resection. The promising prediction of the differentiation of HCC remains a challenge. The purpose of our study was to investigate the value of amide proton transfer (APT) imaging in predicting the histological grade of HCC, compared with the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging. Methods: From September 2018 to February 2020, 88 patients with HCC were enrolled and divided into four groups (G1, G2, G3, and G4) based on the histologic grades. Preoperative APT signal intensity (SI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true molecular diffusion coefficient (D), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f ) of HCC were independently measured by two radiologists. The averaged values of those parameters were compared using an analysis of variance. The Spearman rank analysis was used to compare the correlation between those imaging parameters and the histological grades. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to explore the predictive performance. Results: There were significant differences in APT SI, ADC, D, and f among the four grades of HCC (all P < 0.001). A moderate to good relationship was found between APT SI and the histologic grade of HCC (r = 0.679, P < 0.001). APT SI had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.890 (95% CI: 0.805-0.947) for differentiating low- from high-grade HCC, and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 85.71% and 82.05%, respectively. Comparison of ROC curves demonstrated that the AUC of APT SI was significantly higher than those of IVIM-derived parameter (Z = 2.603, P = 0.0092; Z = 2.099, P = 0.0358; Z = 4.023, P = 0.0001; Z = 2.435, P = 0.0149, compared with ADC, D, D*, and f , respectively). Moreover, the combination of both techniques further improved the diagnostic performance, with an AUC of 0.929 (95% CI: 0.854-0.973). Conclusion: APT imaging may be a potential noninvasive biomarker for the prediction of histologic grading of HCC and complements IVIM imaging for the more accurate and comprehensive characterization of HCC.
