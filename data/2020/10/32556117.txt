Neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) is a zinc finger protein that acts as a negative transcriptional regulator by recruiting histone deacetylases and other co-factors. It plays a crucial role in nervous system development and is recently reported to be involved in tumorigenesis in a tumor type-dependent manner; however, the role of NRSF in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we found that NRSF expression was up-regulated in 27 of 49 human HCC tissue samples examined. Additionally, mice with conditional NRSF-knockout in the liver exhibited a higher tolerance against diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced acute liver injury and were less sensitive to DEN-induced HCC initiation. Our results showed that silencing NRSF in HepG2 cells using RNAi technology significantly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation and severely hindered their migration and invasion potentials. Our results demonstrated that NRSF plays a pivotal role in promoting DEN-induced HCC initiation via a mechanism related to the STAT3 and AKT signaling pathways. Thus, NRSF could be a potential therapeutic target for treating human HCC.
