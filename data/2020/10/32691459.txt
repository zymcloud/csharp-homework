Aim:Adherence to dietary recommendations has been linked to a reduced risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and dying of chronic liver disease. However, its role in the prognosis of HCC is still unclear. We prospectively investigated the association of two dietary quality indices, the Chinese Healthy Eating Index (CHEI) and the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), with all-cause and HCC-specific mortality in a large prospective cohort of HCC survivors.Methods:We included 887 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated HCC enrolled in the Guangdong Liver Cancer Cohort (GLCC) between September 2013 and April 2017 in the analysis. CHEI and HEI-2015 scores were calculated based on the dietary intake in the year before diagnosis of HCC. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each index.Results:During a median follow-up of 797 days, 389 deaths were identified, including 347 from HCC. Higher CHEI scores, reflecting favorable adherence to the 2016 Dietary Guidelines for Chinese, were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (T3 vs. T1 : HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58-0.98) and HCC-specific mortality (T3 vs. T1 : HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.98). Non-significant, inverse associations of HEI-2015 score with all-cause mortality (T3 vs. T1 : HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.67-1.11) and HCC-specific mortality (T3 vs. T1 : HR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.71-1.21) were suggested.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that better adherence to the 2016 Dietary Guidelines for Chinese may reduce the risk of all-cause and HCC-specific mortality in patients with HCC.
