BACKGROUND The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognosis among patients with a single large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) >5 cm compared with other patients in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A or stage B. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on patients with BCLC stage A/B HCC were collected between 2008 and 2012. BCLC stage A was subclassified as A1 (single tumor, 2-5 cm, or 2-3 nodules Â£3 cm), or A2 (single tumor >5 cm). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated and compared. RESULTS Among 1005 patients with HCC, 455 were stage A1, 188 were stage A2, and 362 were stage B. The OS of stage A2 patients was significantly worse than that of stage A1 patients (median survival, 30.6 vs. 43.2 months, p5 cm had a comparable survival with BCLC stage B. HCC >5 cm should therefore be classified as an intermediate stage.
