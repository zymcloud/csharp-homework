Background:The present study investigated the serum detectability and the diagnostic implications of long non-coding RNAs; nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) in viral hepatitis C (HCV) and HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The study included twenty healthy controls, forty non-malignant HCV patients and forty HCV-associated HCC patients. The study assessed liver function tests, the antioxidant status, serum alpha fetoprotein, p53, NEAT1 and TUG1.Results:Diminished serum expression of NEAT1 and TUG1 was observed in HCV and HCV-associated HCC and was closely associated with deregulated liver function and elevated AFP levels. A model of NEAT1, TUG1 and AFP accurately differentiated between HCC patients and healthy controls with sensitivity greater than that of AFP alone. Additionally, the diagnostic performance of a model of TUG1, p53 and AFP was superior to that of each marker alone for predicting HCC in HCV patients.Conclusion:Significant alterations in the serum expression of NEAT1 and TUG1 in HCV and HCV-associated HCC patients were recorded. We propose NEAT1 and TUG1 as non-invasive, cost-effective and complementary biomarkers that improve the diagnostic characteristics of AFP.
