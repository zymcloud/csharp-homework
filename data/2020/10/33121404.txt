Background:LncRNA is a kind of non-coding RNA and its research is more popular in recent years, which has more than 200 nucleotides. It plays a significant part in a variety of biological functions, including chromosome modification, genome modification, transcriptional activation, transcriptional interference, and other processes. FTX, at the center of the X chromosome inactivation, it was showed that lncRNA FTX regulates cancer cells' development, migration and invasion in many studies.Methods:Relevant literatures were collected through PubMed system search and summarized.Results:LncRNA FTX abnormally increased in tumor cells, such as liver cancer, stomach cancer, leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, glioma, osteosarcoma, etc. However, the expression level decreased in temporal lobe epilepsy, liver cirrhosis, heart failure, etc. Conclusion: FTX may be an important regulatory factor and a potential therapeutic target in cancers.
LncRNA FTX; cancer; cirrhosis; heart failure.; temporal lobe epilepsy.
