In recent years, the incidence of liver cancer has increased and is currently the sixth most common tumor and the second leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Most cases of liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Surgery, including liver transplantation or resection, and radiofrequency ablation therapies are all considered to be the curative treatment options for early-stage HCC. However, most patients have advanced HCC at the time of diagnosis, contributing to a poor prognosis. Therefore, improved treatment for late-stage HCC is needed. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), among which programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 are the representative immunological checkpoints, have shown great promise and progress for HCC treatment. The present review summarizes recent studies that have focused on ICIs and discusses the present limitations affecting the development of new therapeutic strategies.
