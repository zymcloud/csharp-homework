Accumulating evidence indicates that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis, recurrence, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance are strongly associated with liver cancer stem cells (CSCs), a rare subpopulation of highly tumorigenic cells with self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential. Previous studies identified B cell leukemia/lymphoma-11b (BCL11B) as a novel tumor suppressor with impressive capacity to restrain CSC traits. However, the implications of BCL11B in HCC remain unclear. In this study, we found that low BCL11B expression was an independent indicator for shorter overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) for HCC patients with surgical resection. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed BCL11B as a tumor suppressor in HCC with inhibitory effects on proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and mobility. Furthermore, BCL11B could suppress CSC traits, as evidenced by dramatically decreased tumor spheroid formation, self-renewal potential and drug resistance. A Cignal Finder Array and dual-luciferase activity reporter assays revealed that BCL11B could activate the transcription of P73 via an E2F1-dependent manner. Thus, we concluded that BCL11B is a strong suppressor of retaining CSC traits in HCC. Ectopic expression of BCL11B might be a promising strategy for anti-HCC treatment with the potential to cure HBV-related HCC regardless of P53 mutation status.
