The P2Y12 receptor is an adenosine diphosphate responsive G protein-coupled receptor expressed on the surface of platelets and is the pharmacologic target of several anti-thrombotic agents. In this study, we use liver samples from mice with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma to show that P2Y12 is expressed by macrophages in the liver. Using in vitro methods, we show that inhibition of P2Y12 with ticagrelor enhances tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages and induces an anti-tumoral phenotype. Treatment with ticagrelor also increases the expression of several actors of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways, suggesting activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Inhibiting the UPR with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (Tudca) diminishes the pro-phagocytotic effect of ticagrelor, thereby indicating that P2Y12 mediates macrophage function through activation of ER stress pathways. This could be relevant in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease and cancer, as macrophages are considered key players in these inflammation-driven pathologies.
