Background:It is not known whether percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) has the same treatment efficacy and fewer complications than laparoscopic resection in patients with small centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Aim:To compare the effectiveness of PRFA with classical laparoscopic resection in patients with small HCC and document the safety parameters.Methods:In this retrospective study, 85 patients treated with hepatic resection (HR) and 90 PRFA-treated patients were enrolled in our hospital from July 2016 to July 2019. Treatment outcomes, including major complications and survival data, were evaluated.Results:The results showed that minor differences existed in the baseline characteristics between the patients in the two groups. PRFA significantly increased cumulative recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio 1.048, 95%CI: 0.265-3.268) and overall survival (hazard ratio 0.126, 95%CI: 0.025-0.973); PRFA had a lower rate of major complications than HR (7.78% vs 20.0%, P < 0.05), and hospital stay was shorter in the PRFA group than in the HR group (7.8 ± 0.2 d vs 9.5 ± 0.3 d, P < 0.001).Conclusion:Based on the data obtained, we conclude that PRFA was superior to HR and may reduce complications and hospital stay in patients with small HCC.
