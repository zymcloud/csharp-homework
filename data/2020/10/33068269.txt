The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein that stimulates cell proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells in the bone marrow. Several cases of G-CSF-producing malignant tumors in various organs have been reported, but there are only nine cases of G-CSF-producing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) reported in the English literature. G-CSF-producing tumors grow rapidly and have a high probability of distant metastases; thus, they generally have a poor prognosis. Given that the mechanism of the carcinogenesis of G-CSF-producing HCC remains unclear, an efficient treatment strategy also remains to be elucidated. We report herein a case of G-CSF-producing HCC accompanied by leukocytosis and high serum G-CSF concentrations in the disease progression stage after long-term complete response. We also reviewed previous reports to investigate the clinical behaviors of G-CSF-producing HCC, including our case. Clinicians should consider G-CSF-producing HCC in patients with a hepatic mass and drastic leukocytosis, without any evidence of infection and blood disorders. Early diagnosis and prompt therapy, including radical resection, may provide a more favorable prognosis.
