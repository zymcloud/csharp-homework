Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a good indication for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cases involving ≦ 3 tumors of ≦ 30 mm in size, many hepatologists are hesitant to perform the procedure for patients with hemorrhagic disorders. We herein report the successful treatment of HCC by laparoscopic RFA in a patient with hemophilia A. A 48-year-old man with moderate form of hemophilia A had a single HCC at segment 8. To perform laparoscopic RFA safely, recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) was administered to maintain factor VIII activity (FVIII:C) > 80% on the operation day and > 40% for 6 days after the operation in accordance with the guidelines. A total of 23,000 units of rFVIII was used. Laparoscopic RFA was completed with an operation time of 105 min and
