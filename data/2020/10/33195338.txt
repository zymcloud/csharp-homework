Intratumoral neovascularization has intricate effects on tumor growth, metastasis, and treatment. Over the last 30 years, Microvessel density (MVD) has been the standard method for laboratory and clinical evaluation of angiogenesis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a typical hypervascularized tumor, and the predictive value of MVD for prognosis is still controversial. According to previous viewpoints, this has been attributed to the determination of hotspot, counting methods, vascular endothelial markers, and different definitions of high and low vascular density; however, the heterogeneity of tumor angiogenesis patterns should be factored. The breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and algorithm can improve the objectivity and repeatability of MVD measurement, thus saving a lot of manpower. Presently, anti-angiogenesis therapy is the only effective systematic treatment for liver cancer, and the use of imaging technology-assisted MVD measurement is expected to be a reliable index for evaluating the curative effect. MVD in multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma represents a subject area with huge understudied potential, and exploring it might advance our understanding of tumor heterogeneity.
