Background& aims:Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management in patients with cirrhosis is complicated. No clinical trials have investigated appropriate antidiabetic drug use in these patients. This study compared the risks of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and hepatic outcomes between patients with T2DM and cirrhosis using and not using thiazolidinedione (TZD).Methods:We selected 1,705 propensity score-matched TZD users and nonusers from a Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database cohort of T2DM patients with compensated cirrhosis between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2012 and followed them until December 31, 2013. Cox proportional hazards models with robust sandwich standard error estimates were used to assess risks of investigated outcomes for TZD users.Results:MACE incidence rates during follow-up were 2.14 and 1.30 per 100 patient-years for TZD users and nonusers, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.19). On the basis of TZD use, the aHRs (95% CIs) for stroke, ischemic heart disease and heart failure were 1.81 (1.28-2.55), 1.59 (1.03-2.44) and 2.09 (1.22-3.60) respectively. Compared with TZD nonusers, rosiglitazone users had significantly higher aHR [1.67 (1.26-2.20)] and pioglitazone users had no significant difference of aHR [1.12 (0.90-1.64)]. All-cause mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic failure risks did not differ significantly between TZD users and nonusers.Conclusions:Compared with nonuser, TZD users demonstrated significantly higher MACE risks. Therefore, the risks of cardiovascular complications should be considered when prescribing TZDs to patients with T2DM and cirrhosis.
