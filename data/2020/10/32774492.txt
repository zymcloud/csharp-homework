Herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) is overexpressed in several malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, to the best of our knowledge, the clinical significance of HVEM in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC remains unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the clinical significance of HVEM in HBV-related HCC. In the present study, HVEM expression was evaluated in HCC cell lines and HCC frozen samples. The prognostic value of HVEM was assessed in a cohort of 221 patients with HBV-related HCC, following radical resection. B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) expression in subsets of CD8+ T cells was determined via flow cytometry analysis. The results demonstrated high HVEM expression in HCC cell lines, and in HCC tissues compared with paired non-cancerous liver tissues. HVEM expression was demonstrated to be significantly associated with tumor encapsulation and vascular invasion. Furthermore, tumor HVEM status was significantly associated with infiltration of regulatory T cells, but not with CD8+ T cells. Notably, high HVEM expression in HCC was determined to be an independent predictor of an unfavorable outcome of patients with HCC following radical resection. Higher BTLA expression (the receptor of HVEM) was observed in both HCC-infiltrating CD8+ effector memory (CCR7- CD45RA-) and CD45RA+ effector memory (CCR7- CD45RA+) T cells in HCC tissues and blood compared with those in paired peritumor tissues or peripheral blood. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that HVEM may serve a critical role in HBV-related HCC, most likely by promoting tumor progression and tumor immune evasion, thus the HVEM/BLTA signaling pathway may be a potential target in tumor immunotherapy.
