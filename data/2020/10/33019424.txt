Given that evidence supporting chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection developed chance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following antiviral agents therapy is controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the risk.We evaluated 20 retrospective and prospective cohort studies published up to 31 December 2017 which investigated the association between sustained virological response (SVR) and incidence of HCC patients treated with monotherapy interferon (IFN) or IFN plus ribavirin (RBV) therapy. The primary outcome of the study was the cumulative incidence of HCC. Odds ratio (OR) was used to evaluate the index of effect size for the association between SVR and treatment with IFN alone or IFN/RBV in CHC patients.SVR patients demonstrated a lower incidence of HCC compared to non-SVR patients. Non-SVR patients had greater odds of HCC incidence compared to SVR patients in the treatment of IFN plus RBV (pooled OR = 7.405, 95% CI = 4.689 to 11.694, P
