Background & aims:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) secondary to chronic liver disease often require invasive procedures but frequently have thrombocytopenia. Lusutrombopag is an agonist of the thrombopoietin receptor that activates platelet production.Methods:We performed an integrated analysis of data from 2 phase 3 trials (L-PLUS 1, Japan, October 2013 to May 2014, and L-PLUS 2, global, June 2015 to April 2017) that compared the efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag with placebo in patients with chronic liver disease, with and without HCC. Our analysis included patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grades of 0 or 1, Child-Pugh classes A or B, and a platelet count less than 50 Ã— 109/L who were scheduled to undergo invasive procedures in 9 to 14 days. Patients received lusutrombopag (3 mg) or placebo daily for 7 days or fewer before an invasive procedure. Imaging studies assessed treatment-emergent adverse events, including asymptomatic portal vein thrombosis. The primary end point was no requirement for platelet transfusion before the invasive procedure and rescue therapies for bleeding 7 days or fewer after the invasive procedure.Results:The per-protocol population included 270 patients (95 with HCC). A significantly higher proportion of patients with HCC who received lusutrombopag achieved the primary end point (68.0%) vs patients who received placebo (8.9%) (P Conclusions:Patients with and without HCC receiving lusutrombopag had a reduction in the number of platelet transfusions before invasive procedures compared with patients receiving placebo, with no increase in thrombosis or bleeding.
