Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often treated with doxorubicin. MicroRNAs have been shown to have important regulatory roles in cancer and serve as a target in chemoresistance. In this study, we investigated the effects of specific microRNA-200a (miR-200a) on HCC tumor cell growth and effect of doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity. Our results show miR-200a is downregulated in human HCC and HCC tumor cell lines. Increasing miR-200a expression inhibited HCC growth and synergized with the antitumor effects of doxorubicin. Inhibiting endogenous miR-200a promoted tumor growth and chemotherapeutic resistance. Increasing miR-200a expression inhibited tumor metabolism (ATP production, mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis), while inhibition of endogenous miR-200a reversed these effects. MiR-200a expression also increased autophagy and synergized with doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity. This study identifies a novel role of miR-200a in potentiating doxorubicin-mediated therapeutic effects in HCC.
