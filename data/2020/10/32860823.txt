Cisplatin is an antineoplastic drug well recognized for its success in the battle against several types of cancer in adult, juvenile, and child populations. Meanwhile, this drug is also famous due to its serious side effects, such as hepatotoxicity. This study evaluated the hepatoprotective effectiveness of Diphenyl Diselenide (PhSe)2 and Ebselen in a model of cisplatin-induced toxicity in juvenile rats. Juvenile Wistar rats received a single intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of cisplatin (6 mg/kg) or saline solution, at postnatal day (PND) 21. Ebselen (11 mg/kg) or (PhSe)2 (12 mg/kg) was intragastrically (i.g) administered in rats from PND 21 to PND 25. At PND 26, the blood and liver were collected for the biochemistry assays. A single administration of cisplatin was enough to alter the makers of hepatic function (an increase of AST activity) and the blood lipid profile (an increase of cholesterol and triglycerides, TG). The cisplatin-induced metabolic disruption was demonstrated by the increase of hepatic glycogen and TG contents and hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and tyrosine aminotransferase activities; a decrease of citrate synthase activity and the levels of GLUT-2. Cisplatin-induced hepatic oxidative stress was characterized by an increase in reactive oxygen species, TBARS, protein carbonyl, and Nox levels as well as the decrease in NPSH levels. Ebselen and (PhSe)2 were effective against all alterations caused by this chemotherapy medication. The present findings highlight the (PhSe)2 and Ebselen similar hepatoprotective effectiveness against cisplatin-induced disruption of metabolic homeostasis and redox balance in juvenile rats.
