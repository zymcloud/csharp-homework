Cancer cells are highly dependent on different metabolic pathways for sustaining their survival, growth, and proliferation. Lipid metabolism not only provides the energetic needs of the cells but also provides the raw material for cellular growth and the signaling molecules for many oncogenic pathways. Mainly processed in the liver, lipids play an essential role in the physiology of this organ and in the pathological progression of many diseases such as metabolic syndrome and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The progression of HCC is associated with inflammation and complex metabolic reprogramming, and its prognosis remains poor because of the lack of effective therapies despite many years of dedicated research. Defects in hepatic lipid metabolism induce abnormal gene expression and rewire many cellular pathways involved in oncogenesis and metastasis, implying that interfering with lipid metabolism within the tumor and the surrounding microenvironment may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating liver cancer patients. Therefore, this review focuses on the latest advances in drugs targeting lipid metabolism and leading to promising outcomes in preclinical studies and some ongoing clinical trials.
