Background:An elevated preoperative aspartate aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI) may predict poor survival in various cancers. However, the prognostic value of aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be determined.Materials and methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 983 patients with HCC in our hospital from February 2007 to March 2016. A propensity-score matching (PSM) was performed to correct the selection bias and confounding factors. The risk of death and recurrence was plotted over aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI) using the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS)-smoothed fit curve. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier method analysis was utilized to the role of aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI) in HCC. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify independent prognostic factors associated with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS).Results:With the increase of aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI), the risk of recurrence and death in HCC patients increases. In time-dependent ROC analysis, the AUC of aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI) for predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year OS were 0.668 (95% CI: 0.596-0.740), 0.605 (95% CI: 0.560-0.649) and 0.613 (95% CI: 0.570-0.656), respective. The AUC of aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI) for predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year RFS were 0.598 (95% CI: 0.555-0.641), 0.590 (95% CI: 0.552-0.628) and 0.604 (95% CI: 0.562-0.646), respectively. HCC patients with high aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI) had a poor overall survival. Moreover, cox regression analysis revealed that aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI) was an independent factor affecting the prognosis of HCC patients.Conclusions:Elevated preoperative aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI) is a noninvasive, simple, and effective predictor in the prognosis of patients with HCC.
