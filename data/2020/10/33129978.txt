Introduction and objectives:Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) has several limitations due to the lack of standardization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical and physical characteristics and behaviors over time of emulsions for cTACE and to assess intra- and inter-operator variabilities in the preparation processes.Materials and methods:This in vitro study involved evaluation of emulsions for cTACE prepared using two methods: water-in-oil (WiO) and chemotherapeutic-in-oil (CiO). Three emulsions were prepared with each method and obtained after 20, 50, and 100 pumping exchanges. A drop from each final mixture was analyzed via light microscopy (time 1) and after 5, 10, 15, and 20 min since the end of preparation. After 20 min, all preparations were re-mixed and new drops were re-evaluated. The intra- and inter-operator variabilities were analyzed.Results:The mean droplet diameter decreased non-significantly when the number of pumping exchanges increased and increased significantly over time for both WiO and CiO. The droplets returned to their initial diameters after re-mixing. There were no significant differences in the intra- and inter-operator variabilities (P > 0.01).Conclusions:Any interventional radiologist, regardless of their experience, may prepare these emulsions. These data may represent a set of instructions to standardize cTACE.
