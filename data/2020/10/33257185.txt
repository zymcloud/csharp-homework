The high expression of sonic hedgehog ligand (SHh) is closely correlated to the metastasis, drug resistance and poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, sensitive, specific and efficient detection methods for SHh are needed for the early diagnosis and assessment of prognosis. Herein, an aptamer, AP32 that specifically binds to SHh (KD = 25.7 ± 4.1 nM) was obtained by SELEX technology with further optimization. In vivo experiments confirmed that AP32 has the potential to be an imaging probe for Huh-7 cell-derived xenograft. The interaction mode in 3-dimensional configuration between the aptamer and SHh was established by molecular simulation and confirmed by mutations at key sites of the aptamer. An aptasensor-based assay was successfully developed by conjugating Texas-Red-labeled AP32 to microbeads, and was used to analyze SHh content in hepatoma cell lysates, serum and HCC specimens. The method exhibited a broad detection range from 0.07 to 62.5 nM with a low detection limit of 69 pM, and a recovery rate of 104.6 ± 3.9% in serum. When the assay was used to measure SHh content in tissue lysates, the results demonstrated that it possessed 57.1% positivity, 100% specificity in distinguishing 28 HCC specimens from normal tissues, and was compensatory for detection of HCC in AFP-negative cases. Moreover, elevated SHh levels are indicative of portal vein invasion at 77.8% positive rate. This novel aptasensor-based SHh assay may offer a reliable means in predicting early metastasis and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.
