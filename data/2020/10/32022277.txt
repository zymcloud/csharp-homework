Background and aims:The long-term risk of disease for patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the absence of elevated enzymes is unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Corporate Data Warehouse of the Veterans Health Administration.Approach and results:We classified patients into three groups: patients with steatosis/normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), steatosis/elevated ALT, and no steatosis/normal ALT. We examined incidence rates for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and conducted cause-specific hazard models to evaluate the risk of cirrhosis and HCC. We identified 3,522 patients with steatosis/normal ALT, 15,419 patients with steatosis/elevated ALT, and 9,267 patients with no steatosis/normal ALT. The mean age in each group was 58.9, 54.7 and 59.3 years, respectively; over 90% were men. Compared to patients with hepatic steatosis/normal ALT, those with steatosis/elevated ALT were younger and more likely to be obese (both P Conclusions:Patients with hepatic steatosis with persistently normal ALT are at lower risk for cirrhosis compared to those with steatosis and elevated ALT and not different from the risk in a clinical cohort without hepatic steatosis.
