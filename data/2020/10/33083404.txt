Background:The therapeutic approach of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents a real challenge for clinicians, because of the variable clinical course; the recent availability of numerous targeted therapies that have significantly improved overall oncological results, but still with a low percentage of complete responses; and the increasing role of metastasectomy (MSX) as an effective strategy to achieve a durable cure, or at least defer initiation of systemic therapies, in selected patients and in the context of multimodality treatment strategies.Case summary:We report here the case of a 40-year-old man who was referred to our unit in November 2004 with lung and mediastinal lymph nodes metastases identified during periodic surveillance 6 years after a radical nephrectomy for RCC; he underwent MSX of multiple lung nodules and mediastinal lymphadenectomy, with subsequent systemic therapy with Fluorouracil, Interferon-alpha and Interleukin 2. The subsequent clinical course was characterized by multiple sequential abdominal and thoracic recurrences, successfully treated with multiple systemic treatments, repeated local treatments, including two pancreatic resections, conservative resection and ablation of multiple bilobar liver metastases, resection and stereotactic body radiotherapy of multiple lung metastases. He is alive without evidence of recurrence 20 years after initial nephrectomy and sequential treatment of recurrences in multiple sites, including resection of more than 38 metastases, and 5 years after his last MSX.Conclusion:This case highlights that effective multimodality therapeutic strategies, including multiple systemic treatments and iterative aggressive surgical resection, can be safely performed with long-term survival in selected patients with multiple metachronous sequential metastases from RCC.
