Purpose:To assess the accuracy of gadobenate-enhanced MRI for predicting microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients operated for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The 164 patients who met the inclusion criteria were assigned to one of two groups: the MVI-positive group and the MVI-negative group. Imaging results were compared between the two groups using the Kruskal test, chi-square test, independent sample t test, and logistic regression analysis.Results:Differences in the capsule (p = 0.037) and margin (p = 0.004) of the tumor, rim enhancement (p = 0.002), peritumoral enhancement in the arterial phase (p Conclusions:Rim enhancement in the arterial phase and peritumoral hypointensity in the HBP were identified as independent risk factors for MVI in patients with HCC.Key points:• Rim enhancement in the arterial phase and peritumoral hypointensity in the hepatobiliary phase were independent risk factors for microvascular invasion in patients with HCC. • Use of the two predictors in combination had a sensitivity of 32.79% and a specificity of 95.15% for predicting microvascular invasion.
