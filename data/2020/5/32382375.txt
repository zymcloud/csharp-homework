The supraduodenal artery might arise from the hepatic, gastroduodenal, or right gastric arteries, but only a few studies have addressed the branching pattern of this artery. We herein describe a case of an 80-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma located in segment I. Selective arteriography and CT angiography showed that the supraduodenal artery formed a common trunk with the caudate artery to feed the tumor. The patient was successfully treated with superselective transarterial chemoembolization without gastrointestinal complications. To avoid nontargeting chemoembolization of the duodenum, interventional radiologists should be aware of this branching pattern. In suspected cases, selective CT arteriography plays a crucial role.
