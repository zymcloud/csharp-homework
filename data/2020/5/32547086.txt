Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate predictive and prognostic significance of elevated carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) serum level preoperatively.Methods:A total of 3440 HCC patients were retrospectively enrolled into this study, and all of them underwent curative hepatectomy. The clinical and pathological variables together with CA125, AFP serum level were collected at diagnosis and postoperative care stages. A chi-square test was used to compare the differences between variables. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence﻿-free survival (RFS) were measured with the Kaplan-Meier method. To estimate prognostic factors, a multivariate ﻿Cox regression analysis was performed.Results:﻿Of the 3440 enrolled patients, 409 (11.9%) exhibited elevated preoperative serum CA125 level﻿, ﻿and high preoperative serum CA125 level was significantly associated with younger age, female, higher ALBI grade, higher serum AFP level, blood transfusion, more operative bleeding loss, larger tumor size, multiple tumor, increased macro- or micro-vascular invasion, Edmondson grade III-IV, absence of tumor capsular, satellite nodules, liver cirrhosis, more advanced TNM stages and BCLC stages. HCC patients with high preoperative serum CA125 level usually had a shorter OS rate and experienced a higher probability of recurrence than those with normal preoperative serum level of CA125 (pConclusion:Elevated preoperative serum CA125 correlated with many malignant characterizations of HCC and served as an independent prognostic factor of OS and RFS.
