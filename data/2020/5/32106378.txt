Faciogenital Dysplasia 1 (FGD1) has been involved in a variety of biological processes, including cytoskeleton restructuring, cell morphology, cell cycle progression, and cell polarity. Abnormal expression of FGD1 was also identified in several types of cancers, indicating its critical role in the development of cancers. However, little is known about the role of FGD1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the expression of FGD1 in HCC was mined with the RNA sequencing data from the cancer genome atlas. By over-expressing or knocking down of FGD1, the effects of FGD1 on the malignant behavior of HCC were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. We find that FGD1 is up-regulated in HCC and correlated with the development and prognosis of HCC. By over-expressing or knocking down of FGD1, the effects of FGD1 on the malignant behavior of HCC were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of FGD1 remarkably inhibits the malignant behaviors and causes morphological disorder of pseudopodia, autophagy inhibition and mitochondrial dyfunction in HCC cells. Further investigation shows that Cdc42, a Rho GTPase, plays a role in these processes. Overexpression of FGD1 significantly promotes the oncogenic properties of HCC cells. Collectively, these findings reveal that FGD1 exhibits oncogenic properties in HCC through regulating cell morphology, autophagy and mitochondrial function, suggesting that FGD1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
