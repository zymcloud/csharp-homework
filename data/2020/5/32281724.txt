Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignant tumour, which has posed a heavy health and financial burden worldwide. Due to limited symptoms at the early stage and the limitation in current biomarkers, HCC patients are usually diagnosed at the advanced stage with a pessimistic overall survival rate. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a subclass of single-stranded RNAs characterized by a covalently closed loop structure without 3'- or 5'-end. With advances in high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics, accumulating studies have demonstrated the promotor or suppressor roles of circRNAs in the carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis of HCC. Moreover, circRNAs are characteristic of higher abundance, stability and conservation compared with linear RNAs. Therefore, circRNAs have emerged as one of the most promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HCC with reliable accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. In this review, we briefly introduce the characteristics of circRNAs and summarize the roles of circRNAs in the biological procedures of HCC. Furthermore, we provide an overview on the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of circRNAs as biomarkers for patients with HCC. Finally, we discuss future perspectives of circRNAs in cancer research.
