Background:Liver is one of the most common organs involved by metastatic neoplasms. In addition, a number of primary tumors can arise in the liver. Fine needle biopsy (FNB) is the most commonly used method for diagnosis of liver masses. Not much literature is available during the past 10 years about FNB of liver tumors. All large studies were performed more than 15 years ago. With the introduction of new disease entities, new tumor classification systems, and new diagnostic methods, updated documentation of FNB of liver neoplasms is much needed.Methods:Liver FNB cases that were diagnosed as "Positive for Malignancy" between 2010 and 2018 were retrieved from the cytopathology database in our institution. Patient medical records, cytopathology and surgical pathology reports, and slides from selected cases were retrieved and reviewed.Results:Over 30 different types of malignant tumors were identified in 624 malignant FNB cases, with the most common tumors being metastatic colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Rare tumors include EBV-positive leiomyosarcoma, mesothelioma, and paraganglioma, among others. A subset of patients presented with widespread metastases involving liver with no known history. Identifying the primary sites in those cases can be challenging. We also found that in our practice, a significant number of hepatocellular carcinoma were diagnosed by FNB in recent years.Conclusions:A tremendous variety of neoplasms can occur in liver. Accurate diagnosis is essential for proper patient management. Familiarization with morphological features and judicious usage of ancillary studies are essential for accurate diagnosis.
