Background and objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer associated death globally. Serum micro RNAs are full of potential as noninvasive biomarkers. Here, we aim to assess the performance of serum MicroRNA-155 and MicroRNA-665 as diagnostic biomarker for HCC comparing to AFP.Methods:Serum samples were collected from 200 subjects (40 healthy control, 80 chronic hepatitis C patients with cirrhosis and without HCC (LC) and 80 HCC patients currently infected by hepatitis C infection and didn't start the treatment). The HCC patients didn't include alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nor autoimmune liver disease. MicroRNA-155 and MicroRNA-665 expression were measured by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), while AFP level was assessed by ELISA method.Results:Both miR-155 and miR-665 were significantly elevated in HCC group as compared to both control and LC groups. The comparison between LC and HCC patients revealed that the serum level of miR-155 was a significant increase in HCC patients compared to LC patients; however, the serum level of miR-665 didn't show any significant difference between the same two groups. MiR-665 expression level showed a direct correlation with tumor size in HCC patients.Conclusions:Using measurement against AFP level in serum, miR-665 is considered a promising serum biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC patients among the LC patients without HCC. MiR-155 didn't provide a better performance than serum AFP as a diagnostic biomarker among the same group. MiR-665 may serve as a good indicator for HCC prognosis.
