Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with an imbalance in fatty acid composition and can progress from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Essential phospholipids (EPL), which contain high levels of 1,2-dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine, can be used to treat NAFLD. Polyenylphosphatidylcholine (PPC) preparations are external, commercially available EPL products. The lipid composition of five commercially available PPC preparations, including Essentiale Forte, Fortifikat, Hepatoprotect Regenerator, Fortifikat Forte, and Esentin Forte were compared, the outcome of which may impact physician choice in the treatment of NAFLD. Following lipid extraction, a comparative analysis of key lipid content was performed using a QTRAP6500+ triple quadruple ion trap hybrid mass spectrometer (Sciex) in nanoelectrospray ionization mode. The glycerophospholipid composition of each PPC was determined, including levels of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) species, as well as PtdCho:PtdEtn ratio. Of the five preparations analyzed, Essentiale Forte contained the highest PtdCho levels (61.9 mol%) and lowest PtdEtn levels (4.9 mol%). PtdCho 36:4 levels, a polyunsaturated species of PtdCho, were highest in Esentin Forte (39.3 mol%) and Essentiale Forte (38.3 mol%) compared with other PPCs (28.7-35.8 mol%). Levels of lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylglycerol were low in all five preparations. Lipid composition was consistent between the preparations. The high PtdCho:PtdEtn ratio composition of Essentiale Forte compared with the other PPC analyzed, as well as the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggest it could be the most clinically beneficial commercially available hepatoprotective product in the treatment of NAFLD.
