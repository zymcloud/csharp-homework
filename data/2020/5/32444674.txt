Metformin is the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis is the primary contributor to its anti-diabetic effect. Metformin inhibits complex I and Î±-glycerophosphate shuttle, and the resultant increase in cytoplasmic NADH/NAD+ ratio diverts glucose precursors away from gluconeogenesis. These actions depend on metformin-mediated activation of AMP kinase (AMPK). Here we report on a hitherto unknown mechanism. Metformin inhibits the expression of the plasma membrane citrate transporter NaCT in HepG2 cells and decreases cellular levels of citrate. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), an AMPK activator, elicits a similar effect. The process involves a decrease in maximal velocity with no change in substrate affinity. The decrease in NaCT expression is associated with decreased mRNA levels. AMPK inhibits mTOR, and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin also decreases NaCT expression. The transcription factor downstream of AMPK that is relevant to cAMP signaling is CREB; decreased levels of phospho-CREB seem to mediate the observed effects of metformin on NaCT. Citrate is known to suppress glycolysis by inhibiting phosphofructokinase-1 and activate gluconeogenesis by stimulating fructose-1,6-bisphophatase; therefore, the decrease in cellular levels of citrate would stimulate glycolysis and inhibit gluconeogenesis. These studies uncover a novel mechanism for the anti-diabetic actions of metformin.
