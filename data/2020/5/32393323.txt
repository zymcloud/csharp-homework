Background:Association of immune-related adverse events with tumor response has been reported. Reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation (RCCEP) is the most common adverse event related to camrelizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, but lack of comprehensive analyses. In this study, we conducted comprehensive analyses on RCCEP in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with camrelizumab monotherapy.Methods:Data were derived from a Chinese nationwide, multicenter phase 2 trial of camrelizumab in pre-treated advanced HCC. The occurrence, clinicopathological characteristics, and prognostic value of RCCEP were analyzed.Results:With a median follow-up of 12.5 months, 145 of the 217 camrelizumab-treated patients (66.8%) experienced RCCEP (all grade 1 or 2). RCCEP occurred on the skin surface, mainly on the skin surface of head, face, and trunk. RCCEP could be divided into 5 types including "red-nevus-like," "pearl-like," "mulberry-like," "patch-like," and "tumor-like," according to the morphological features. RCCEP biopsy and pathology showed capillary endothelial hyperplasia and capillary hyperplasia in dermis. Significant association between RCCEP occurrence with higher objective response rate was observed (19.3% vs. 5.6%; one-sided p = 0.0044). Compared with those without RCCEP, patients with RCCEP had prolonged progression-free survival (median PFS; 3.2 months vs. 1.9 months; one-sided p Conclusions:RCCEP occurred on the skin surface and was an immune response of skin capillary endothelial cells. RCCEP occurrence positively associated with outcomes of camrelizumab in advanced HCC.
