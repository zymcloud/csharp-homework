Objectives:This study was conducted in order to assess the performance of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) treatment response (TR) (LR-TR) categorization on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (Gd-EOB-MRI) for detecting viable tumors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with locoregional treatment (LRT) and to investigate the added value of ancillary features (AFs) to conventional enhancement-based criteria.Methods:This retrospective study included 183 patients with Gd-EOB-MRI after LRT for HCC and appropriate reference standards for tumor viability (84 viable and 99 nonviable). Two independent radiologists assigned per-lesion mRECIST and TR categories (TR-nonviable, TR-equivocal, or TR-viable) according to the LR-TR algorithm and modified LR-TR algorithms including mLR-TR(TP) allowing transitional phase (TP) washout and mLR-TR(AF) allowing category adjustment by applying AFs. Diagnostic performances of imaging criteria were compared using the Cochran's Q test with post hoc analysis.Results:For detecting viable tumors, LR-TR-viable resulted in sensitivities of 64.5%/39.3% and specificities of 98.0%/98.0% in reviewers 1/2. In comparison to LR-TR-viable, mRECIST-viable, mLR-TR(TP)-viable, and mLR-TR(AF)-viable showed significantly higher sensitivities (92.9%/94.0%, 77.4%/56.6%, and 86.9%/83.3% in reviewers 1/2) (ps 0.05). TR-equivocal was least assigned on mLR-TR(AF) (1.1%/7.7%) than LR-TR (15.8%/32.2%) or mLR-TR(TP) (6.6%/23.5%) in both reviewers.Conclusion:The LR-TR algorithm on Gd-EOB-MRI provides a specific diagnosis of viable tumor but with limited sensitivity. By applying AFs in the category adjustment, more sensitive and confident diagnosis can be achieved without significant loss of specificity.Key points:• The LI-RADS treatment response (LR-TR) algorithm on Gd-EOB-MRI provides a highly specific diagnosis of viable HCC but with limited sensitivity. • The inferior sensitivity of LR-TR-viable category to that of mRECIST can be improved by applying ancillary features in the category adjustment.
