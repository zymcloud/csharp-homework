Background:The prognostic role of intratumoral programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been investigated by several meta-analyses. However, the prognostic value of pretreatment peripheral PD-L1 (PPPD-L1) level in HCC remains undetermined. Thus, this systemic review aimed to establish PPPD-L1 as a new prognostic marker in HCC according to available evidence.Methods:Case-control studies investigating the prognostic role of PPPD-L1 in HCC were systemically sought in the database of PubMed and Web of Science until March 25th, 2020. Our main concern is survival results, including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS). The combined results were summarized in narrative form according to data extracted from each included study.Results:Finally, nine studies published from 2011 to 2019, were incorporated into this systemic review. Among these, six studies evaluated the PD-L1 expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from blood serum, and three studies evaluated the PD-L1 expression by flow cytometric analysis from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). According to the extracted evidence, high PPPD-L1 expression, measured in either blood serum or PBMC, is associated with poor OS, poor DFS, and poor PFS. Meanwhile, PPPD-L1 was also correlated with enlarged tumor size and more likely with advanced tumor stage as well as vascular invasion.Conclusion:High PPPD-L1 level is associated with increased mortality rate and increased recurrence rate in HCC. As a convenient serum marker, PPPD-L1 could be a promising marker of prognosis in HCC patients.
