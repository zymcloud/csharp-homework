Introduction:Hepatoid carcinoma of the ovary (HCO) is a rare disease that originates from the ovarian surface epithelium. It is histologically characterized as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a hepatocyte-rich granular cytoplasm.Patient concerns:A 65-year-old female patient was admitted with complaints of indigestion, abdominal bloating, and pain.Diagnosis:The patient showed an elevated level of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) with abdominal bloating and pain. After surgery and histopathology analysis, she was finally diagnosed with HCO, Figo stage IC.Interventions:After cytoreductive surgery, she underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Although the disease was diagnosed at an early stage, it recurred 6 months after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Elevation of serum AFP level and removal of a mass from the lumbar vertebra confirmed the recurrence of this disease. Subsequently, the patient underwent radiation therapy and palliative chemotherapy.Outcomes:She died 31 months after the diagnosis due to disease progression.Conclusion:The aggressive nature of HCO was clearly observed in this case despite early diagnosis and treatment. Further studies are needed to understand the proper treatment and prognostic factors of HCO.
