Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a term used to characterize a range of disease states that involve the accumulation of fat in the liver but are not associated with excessive alcohol consumption. NAFLD is a prevalent disease that can progress to organ damage like liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Many animal models have demonstrated that one-carbon metabolism is strongly associated with NAFLD. Phosphatidylcholine is an important phospholipid that affects hepatic lipid homeostasis and de novo synthesis of this phospholipid is associated with NAFLD. However, one-carbon metabolism serves to support all cellular methylation reactions and catabolism of methionine, serine, glycine, choline, betaine, tryptophan, and histidine. Several different pathways within one-carbon metabolism that play important roles in regulating energy metabolism and immune function have received less attention in the study of fatty liver disease and fibrosis. This review examines what we have learned about hepatic lipid metabolism and liver damage from the study of one-carbon metabolism thus far and highlights unexplored opportunities for future research.
