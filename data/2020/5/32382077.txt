CR6-interacting factor 1 (Crif1) is a mitochondrial protein which is required for the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. Our bioinformatics analysis based on Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed an aberrant overexpression of CRIF1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the clinical significance and biological functions of CRIF1 are still unclear in this malignancy. Here, we report that CRIF1 is frequently overexpressed in HCC cells mainly due to the downregulation of miR-497-5p, which is associated with poor prognosis of patients with HCC. CRIF1-promoted HCC growth and metastasis by suppressing cell apoptosis and inducing cell cycle progression and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, increased mitochondrial ROS production and consequently activation of the NFÎºB signaling pathway was found to be involved in the promotion of growth and metastasis by CRIF1 in HCC cells. In summary, CRIF1 plays an oncogenic role in HCC progression through activating ROS/NFKB pathway, implying CRIF1 as a potential prognostic factor and therapeutic target in HCC.
