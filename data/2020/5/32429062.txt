Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the primary liver cancer arising from hepatocytes, is a universal health problem and one of the most common malignant tumors. Surgery followed by chemotherapy as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as sorafenib, are primary treatment procedures for HCC, but recurrence of disease because of therapy resistance results in high mortality. It is necessary to identify novel regulators of HCC for developing effective targeted therapies that can significantly interfere with progression of the disease process. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are an abundant group of versatile RNA transcripts that do not translate into proteins, rather serve as potentially functional RNAs. The role of ncRNAs in regulating diverse aspects of the carcinogenesis process are gradually being elucidated. Recent advances in RNA sequencing technology have identified a plethora of ncRNAs regulating all aspects of hepatocarcinogenesis process and serving as potential prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers. The present review provides a comprehensive description of the biological roles of ncRNAs in disease process and therapy resistance, and potential clinical application of these ncRNAs in HCC.
