Background:A hepatitis C (HCV) cure is associated with changes in lipids and inflammatory biomarkers, but its impact on clinical endpoints among treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfected persons is unclear.Methods:People living with HIV from EuroSIDA with a known HCV status after January 2001 were classified into strata based on time-updated HCV RNA measurements and HCV treatment, as either HCV antibody-negative; spontaneously resolved HCV; chronic, untreated HCV; cured HCV (HCV RNA-negative); or HCV treatment failures (HCV RNA-positive). Poisson regression was used to compare incidence rates between HCV groups for end-stage liver disease (ESLD; including hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]), non-acquired immunodeficiency virus defining malignancy (NADM; excluding HCC), and cardiovascular disease (CVD).Results:There were 16 618 persons included (median follow-up 8.3 years, interquartile range 3.1-13.7). There were 887 CVD, 902 NADM, and 436 ESLD events; crude incidence rates/1000 person-years follow-up were 6.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.0-6.9) for CVD, 6.5 (95% CI 6.1-6.9) for NADM, and 3.1 (95% CI 2.8-3.4) for ESLD. After adjustment, there were no differences in incidence rates of NADM or CVD across the 5 groups. HCV-negative individuals (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0.22, 95% CI 0.14-0.34) and those with spontaneous clearance (aIRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36-1.02) had reduced rates of ESLD compared to cured individuals. Persons with chronic, untreated HCV infections (aIRR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02-2.13) or treatment failure (aIRR 1.80, 95% CI 1.22-2.66) had significantly raised rates of ESLD, compared to those who were cured.Conclusions:Incidences of NADM or CVD were independent of HCV group, whereas those cured had substantially lower incidences of ESLD, underlining the importance of successful HCV treatment for reducing ESLD.
