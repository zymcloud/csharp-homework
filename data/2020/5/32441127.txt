In this study, an optimal method used to extract Annona squamosa pericarp oil (ASPO) was established according to the response surface model. The yield of ASPO was 1.45%. 8 fatty acids were identified from ASPO by GC-MS. Among them, (9Z)-9-Octadecenoic acid was abundant and accounted for 49.65%. The anti-hepatoma activities of ASPO were investigated against SMMC-7721 cell line in vitro and H22 cell line in vivo. Proteins associated with apoptosis in tumour tissue were quantified by western blot assay. The result revealed that ASPO had significant anti-hepatoma activities with IC50 value of 15.96 Î¼g/mL in vitro and tumour inhibition rate of 54.14% at 50 mg/kg dose in vivo. Protein analysis showed that ASPO activated apoptosis by down-regulating Bcl-2, up-regulating Bax, cleaving caspase 9, cleaving caspase 8 and cleaving caspase 3 proteins. The possible mechanisms of apoptosis induced by ASPO were related to Fas/FasL/caspase-8/caspase-3 and Bcl-2/bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 pathways.
