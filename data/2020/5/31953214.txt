Changes in the phenotype that characterizes cancer cells are partly due to altered processing of pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. We have previously reported that aberrant splicing plays an essential role in the impaired response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to sorafenib by reducing the expression of functional organic cation transporter type 1 (OCT1, gene SLC22A1) that constitutes the primary way for HCC cells to take up this and other drugs. The present study includes an in silico analysis of publicly available databases to investigate the relationship between alternative splicing of SLC22A1 pre-mRNA and the expression of genes involved in the exon-recognition machinery in HCC and adjacent non-tumor tissue. Using Taqman Low-Density Arrays, the findings were validated in 25 tumors that were resected without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The results supported previous reports showing that there was a considerable degree of alternative splicing of SLC22A1 in adjacent non-tumor tissue, which was further increased in the tumor in a stage-unrelated manner. Splicing perturbation was associated with changes in the profile of proteins determining exon recognition. The results revealed the importance of using paired samples for splicing analysis in HCC and confirmed that aberrant splicing plays an essential role in the expression of functional OCT1. Changes in the exon recognition machinery may also affect the expression of other proteins in HCC. Moreover, these results pave the way to further investigations on the mechanistic bases of the relationship between the expression of spliceosome-associated genes and its repercussion on the appearance of alternative and aberrant splicing in HCC.
