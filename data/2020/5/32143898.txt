Objective:Analysis the epidemiological trends of hospital admissions, intra-hospital deaths, and costs related to chronic hepatitis C (CHC) taking into account four major clinical stages [compensated cirrhosis (CC), end-stage liver disease (ESLD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver transplantation (LT)] in Spain.Methods:Retrospective study in patients with chronic hepatitis C and a hospital admission in the Spanish Minimum Basic Data Set from 2000 to 2015. Outcome variables were admission, death, length of hospital stay and costs.Results:A total of 868,523 hospital admissions with CHC (25.5% CC, 25.3% ESLD, 8.6% HCC, and 2.5% LT) were identified. Overall rates of admission and mortality increased from 2000-2003 to 2004-2007, but after 2008, these rates stabilized and/or decreased. An upward trend was found for hospitalization percentage in CC (from 22.3% to 30%; p Conclusion:The initial upward trend of the disease burden in CHC has changed from 2000 to 2015 in Spain, improving in many parameters after 2004-2007, particularly in the 2012-2015 calendar period.
