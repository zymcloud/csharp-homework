Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that recycles proteins and organelles in a lysosome-dependent manner and is induced as an alternative source of energy and metabolites in response to diverse stresses. Inhibition of autophagy has emerged as an appealing therapeutic strategy in cancer. However, it remains to be explored whether autophagy inhibition is a viable approach for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we identify that water-soluble yeast β-D-glucan (WSG) is a novel autophagy inhibitor and exerts significant antitumour efficacy on the inhibition of HCC cells proliferation and metabolism as well as the tumour growth in vivo. We further reveal that WSG inhibits autophagic degradation by increasing lysosomal pH and inhibiting lysosome cathepsins (cathepsin B and cathepsin D) activities, which results in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, WSG sensitizes HCC cells to apoptosis via the activation of caspase 8 and the transfer of truncated BID (tBID) into mitochondria under nutrient deprivation condition. Of note, administration of WSG as a single agent achieves a significant antitumour effect in xenograft mouse model and DEN/CCl4 (diethylnitrosamine/carbon tetrachloride)-induced primary HCC model without apparent toxicity. Our studies reveal, for the first time, that WSG is a novel autophagy inhibitor with significant antitumour efficacy as a single agent, which has great potential in clinical application for liver cancer therapy.
