Purpose:To assess the safety and tolerability of transarterial drug-eluting bead chemoembolisation (DEB-TACE) using tightly calibrated 100-μm microspheres in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Method:This multicentre prospective study included 131 patients with a 2-year follow-up. All patients had Child-Pugh scores ≤ B7, a good performance status, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A or B. Beads were loaded with 50 mg of doxorubicin per millilitre. Overall, 223 nodules were treated (mean size: 27.6 mm, average number of nodules per patient: 1.7). Toxicity was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.03 and response according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours. The primary endpoint was safety. Secondary endpoints included technical success, post-embolisation syndrome (PES), local tumour response, and 2-year survival.Results:A total of 214 DEB-TACE procedures were performed (mean per patient: 1.64), with a technical success rate of 97.6 % and a PES rate of 9.3 %. Major complications occurred in 6.8 % of patients and 4.1 % of procedures. There were no treatment-related deaths. Doxorubicin dose was an independent predictor of complications (p = 0.01). Four patients were lost to follow-up and 18 received liver transplants. Objective response rates were 74.6 %, 45.7 %, and 44.1 % at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The cumulative 24-month overall survival rate was 55.96 %. Median survival was 22 months (interquartile range = 13-24). Co-morbidities and tumour response were independent predictors of survival (p = 0.0012 and 0.0052, respectively). Complications did not affect survival (p = 0.24).Conclusions:DEB-TACE with tightly calibrated 100-μm beads is safe and not associated with increases in biliary toxicity or complications. Tumour response and survival are in the expected range for chemoembolisation therapy. (Clinical trials ID: NCT02670122).
