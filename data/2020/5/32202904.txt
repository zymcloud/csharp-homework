Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide due to the lack of effective therapy methods. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapies for HCC. CBL0137 is a small molecule that affects p53 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB). The expression of p53 was measured by using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tumor and adjacent tissues. Western blotting (WB) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were employed to detect the level of p-p53, p53, Bax, and PUMA after CBL0137 administration. CCK-8 and immunofluorescence staining (IF) assays were performed to evaluate the proliferation and viability of HCC cells. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of HCC cells. Xenograft model was established to determine the effect of CBL0137 treatment on HCC tumor growth in vivo. HE staining was used to monitor HCC cell morphology and IHC staining for Ki-67 was performed to determine the tumor cell proliferation following CBL0137 treatment. Results showed that the expression of p-p53, p53, Bax, and PUMA was upregulated after CBL0137 administration. The viability, growth, and colony formation of HCC cells were significantly inhibited by CBL0137 in the CBL group compared with the NC group (p
