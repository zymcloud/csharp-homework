Sorafenib is a small, orally-active multikinase inhibitor that is most frequently used for the management of renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and radioactive iodine-resistant thyroid carcinoma. However, recent reports have associated sorafenib with hepatotoxicity that can limit its clinical application, although the mechanism of hepatotoxicity is still to be elucidated. Thus, our study was designed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying sorafenib-induced hepatotoxicity in an in vivo model. Twenty male adult Wistar rats were randomly placed into two groups; the first group received an oral dose of normal saline (vehicle), and the second received sorafenib (30 mg/kg) once daily for twenty-one consecutive days. After twenty-one days, liver tissues and blood samples were used for gene expression, protein expression, and biochemical analysis. Sorafenib treatment resulted in markedly increased levels of alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, which indicate the presence of liver damage. Additionally, sorafenib administration induced the inflammatory and oxidative stress marker NF-ÎºB-p65, while antioxidant enzymes were attenuated. Moreover, sorafenib caused upregulation of both gene and protein for the apoptotic markers cleaved Caspase-3, Bax, and Bid, and downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. In conclusion, our findings suggest that sorafenib administration is associated with hepatotoxicity, which might be due to the activation of oxidative stress and apoptotic pathways.
