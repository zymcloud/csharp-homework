Plasma DNA fragmentomics is an emerging area of research covering plasma DNA sizes, end points, and nucleosome footprints. In the present study, we found a significant increase in the diversity of plasma DNA end motifs in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared with patients without HCC, patients with HCC showed a preferential pattern of 4-mer end motifs. In particular, the abundance of plasma DNA motif CCCA was much lower in patients with HCC than in subjects without HCC. The aberrant end motifs were also observed in patients with other cancer types, including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We further observed that the profile of plasma DNA end motifs originating from the same organ, such as the liver, placenta, and hematopoietic cells, generally clustered together. The profile of end motifs may therefore serve as a class of biomarkers for liquid biopsy in oncology, noninvasive prenatal testing, and transplantation monitoring. SIGNIFICANCE: Plasma DNA molecules originating from the liver, HCC and other cancers, placenta, and hematopoietic cells each harbor a set of characteristic plasma DNA end motifs. Such markers carry tissue-of-origin information and represent a new class of biomarkers in the nascent field of fragmentomics.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 627.
