Anticancer effects were evaluated on three HPLC fractions obtained from a concentrated cranberry juice and cell wall constituents extracted from a probiotic biomass containing Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2. The samples were tested at increasing concentrations for the antiproliferative assay using HT-29 cells' line and for the quinone reductase (QR) assay using Hepa-1c1c7 murine hepatoma cells. Fraction 1 (F1) which is highly concentrated with phenolic acids inhibited the growth of the HT-29 cells' line with IC50 values of 14.80 Âµg Gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/ml. The fraction 3 (F3) which is highly concentrated in flavonols had potency as QR inducer. Furthermore, the results showed that all cranberry fractions combined with cell wall constituents extracted from the probiotic biomass were more effective in inhibiting the growth of HT-29 as compared to the cranberry fractions tested alone, indicating a possible synergy effect between these bio-functional compounds. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study strongly evidenced that cranberry juice fractions combined with cell wall constituents extracted from the probiotic biomass can be used as a potent preventive functional compound against colorectal cancer. Therefore, this research proposes a natural dietary compound to prevent mutagenesis and carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, the industry can formulae products containing probiotic and phenolic compounds as colon cancer cell growth preventive and anticancer products.
