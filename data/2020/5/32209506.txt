Purpose:To identify the treatment options and prognostic factors for patients with initially unresectable ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Between June 2012 to December 2016, 94 consecutive patients with initially unresectable ruptured HCC were analyzed retrospectively in this study. Patients were followed until December 2017. Predictors of short-term (â‰¤30 days) and long-term (>30 days) survival were identified by using logistic regression model and Cox proportional hazard model, respectively.Results:Of the 94 patients, initial hemostasis treatment was achieved by transarterial embolization (TAE) in 59 patients, surgical hemostasis in 14, and conservative treatment in 21. Twenty-five (26.6%) patients died within 30 d after tumor rupture. In the multivariate analysis, patients treated with aggressive initial treatment strategies (TAE or surgical hemostasis) (P Conclusion:Short-term survival of patients with initially unresectable ruptured HCC could achieve with better Child-Pugh class, absence of shock and aggressive initial treatment strategies. After survived the emergency phase of tumor rupture, long-term survival was significantly increased with early modified LCSGJ stage and staged hepatectomy therapy.
