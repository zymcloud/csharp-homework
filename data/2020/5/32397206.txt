Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant human cancer that has increasing mortality rates worldwide. Because CD133+ cells control tumor maintenance and progression, compounds that target CD133+ cancer cells could be effective in combating HCC. We found that the administration of chromenopyrimidinone (CPO) significantly decreased spheroid formation and the number of CD133+ cells in mixed HCC cell populations. CPO not only significantly inhibited cell proliferation in HCC cells exhibiting different CD133 expression levels, but also effectively induced apoptosis and increased the expression of LC3-II in HCC cells. CPO also exhibits in vivo therapeutic efficiency in HCC. Specifically, CPO suppressed the expression of CD133 by altering the subcellular localization of CD133 from the membrane to lysosomes in CD133+ HCC cells. Moreover, CPO treatment induced point mutations in the ADRB1, APOB, EGR2, and UBE2C genes and inhibited the expression of these proteins in HCC and the expression of UBE2C is particularly controlled by CD133 expression among those four proteins in HCC. Our results suggested that CPO may suppress stemness and malignancies in vivo and in vitro by decreasing CD133 and UBE2C expression in CD133+ HCC. Our study provides evidence that CPO could act as a novel therapeutic agent for the effective treatment of CD133+ HCC.
