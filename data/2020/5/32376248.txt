Chitosan/aroylhydrazine composite were synthesized in hydrogel form in which aroylhyrazines, heteroaroylhydrazines as well as p-tolylsulphonylhydrazine embedded in the cross linked Chitosan/oxalic acid network. Their structures were characterized by (elemental analysis, FT-IR, 1H NMR, and XRD). Antimicrobial behavior and Cytotoxicity screening of the examined compounds against breast, colon and hepatocellular cancer were investigated. The obtained data revealed that the examined compounds have promising cell growth inhibitory effect on the cell lines as compared to standard. Also, some of the newly synthesized derivatives had shown better antibacterial and antifungal activities, comparing with that of the parent chitosan.
