Lifestyle modifications focused on healthy eating and regular exercise are the primary recommendations for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, for multiple societal, psychological, physical, genetic, and epigenetic reasons, the ability of people to adopt and sustain such changes is challenging and typically not successful. To end the epidemic of NASH and prevent its complications, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, pharmacological interventions are now being evaluated in clinical trials. Treatments include drugs targeting energy intake, energy disposal, lipotoxic liver injury, and the resulting inflammation and fibrogenesis that lead to cirrhosis. It is likely that patients develop the phenotype of NASH by multiple mechanisms, and thus the optimal treatments of NASH will likely evolve to personalized therapy once we understand the mechanistic underpinnings of NASH in each patient. Reviewed here is the treatment landscape in this rapidly evolving field with an emphasis on drugs in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials.
