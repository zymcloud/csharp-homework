Objective:Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) was proved to play an important role in numerous neurodevelopmental processes. In our study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the NRG1 gene polymorphism and the cognitive function of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicated with post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) before and after the psychological intervention.Methods:Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) were used for cognitive function assessment. Serum level of NRG1 was detected by ELISA, and the correlation between NRG1 level and cognitive function was analyzed. The difference of cognitive function score of patients with HCC complicated with PTSD before and after psychological intervention was compared, and the relationship between rs35753505 and rs3924999 polymorphism with the score was analyzed.Results:Patients with HCC complicated with PTSD showed decreased serum NRG1 level. NRG1 levels of patients in the HCC + PTSD group were positively correlated with MMSE, MoCA, and LOTCA scores. In rs35753505, the CC genotype was a risk factor for the occurrence of PTSD in patients with HCC, while in rs3924999, the GG genotype was a risk factor for the occurrence of PTSD in patients with HCC. After psychological intervention, the CC genotype at rs35753505 and the GG genotype at rs3924999 were susceptible genotypes.Conclusion:CC genotype at rs35753505 and GG genotype at rs3924999 of NRG1 gene increased the risk of PTSD in patients with HCC. CC and GG genotypes were susceptible after psychological intervention.
