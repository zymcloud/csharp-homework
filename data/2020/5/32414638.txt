Rationale and objectives:To investigate the value of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in diagnosing residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE).Materials and methods:Sixty-two patients (50 men, 12 women; mean age, 56.8 ± 1.4 years) with 74 HCCs who underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and DWI in 1-2-month intervals after DEB-TACE were retrospectively studied. Imaging features derived from Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and DWI were analyzed and compared between residual HCCs and necrotic tumors. The sensitivity and specificity of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and DWI with quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in diagnosing residual HCCs were calculated and compared, based on the reference standard of pathology and/or angiography.Results:Thirty-three residual HCCs and 41 necrotic tumors were diagnosed. Residual HCCs presented characteristics of arterial hypervascularity (90.91%) and DWI hyperintensity (78.78%), which were of importance in differentiating necrotic tumors (p-3 mm2/s vs. 1.55 ± 0.50 × 10-3 mm2/s, p< 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for identifying residual HCCs demonstrated that the threshold ADC value of 1.25 × 10-3 mm2/s had 84.85% sensitivity and 87.80% specificity.Conclusion:Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI is superior to DWI in diagnosing residual HCCs after DEB-TACE, and arterial hypervascularity and DWI hyperintensity are important imaging features in distinguishing residual HCCs from necrotic tumors.
