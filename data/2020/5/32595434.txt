Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of liver cancer. Liver cirrhosis of any etiology is considered the main risk factor for the development of HCC. However, HCC in noncirrhotic livers remains an uncommon finding. The association of HCC with a primary gastric adenocarcinoma was described in the literature as part of a hepatoid adenocarcinoma which is a special type of primary gastric carcinoma characterized by histologic similarities to HCC with excessive production of Î±-fetoprotein. Herein, we report the case of a 50-year-old male patient, with no history of pre-existing liver disease, who was admitted due to epigastric pain and vomiting. He was diagnosed with HCC in noncirrhotic liver associated with primary gastric adenocarcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of synchronous HCC and gastric cancer with no hepatoid adenocarcinoma features in Tunisia.
