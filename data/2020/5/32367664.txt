Background/purpose:Anatomical sectionectomy or larger resection is known to be effective in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with microvascular invasion. A non-smooth tumor margin on hepatobiliary-phase gadoxetic acid disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) can predict microvascular invasion of HCC. We evaluated the usefulness of EOB-MRI for operative planning.Methods:We evaluated 224 patients with single HCC who underwent hepatectomy between 2010 and 2013. The tumor margin was determined preoperatively. The hepatic resection was determined based on tumor location, liver function, 3D CT simulation and functional liver reserve. To control for confounding variable distributions, propensity score match was applied to compare the outcomes. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify independent predictors of 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:Of 113 patients with a non-smooth tumor margin, 40 patients (35%) showed microscopic portal invasion. The 5-year RFS and OS rates were significantly higher after sectionectomy or larger hepatectomy (hemihepatectomy) than after segmentectomy or smaller hepatectomy (non-anatomical resection). Of 111 patients with a smooth tumor margin, eight patients (7%) showed microscopic portal invasion. The 5-year RFS and OS rates did not differ significantly between patients who underwent sectionectomy and those who underwent segmentectomy.Conclusions:Our preliminary results appear to recommend that HCC with a non-smooth margin on HB-phase images is treated with anatomical sectionectomy or larger hepatectomy.
