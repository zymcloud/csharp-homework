Purpose:This study investigated the diagnostic outcome of ultrasound (US)-guided focal hepatic lesion biopsy in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and evaluated the US visualization score as a risk factor for non-diagnostic results.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 208 focal hepatic lesions in 208 patients who underwent US-guided biopsy in 2016. Using the US Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2017, each exam was assigned a US visualization score (A, B, or C). Final diagnoses were made using pathology reports, and biopsy results were categorized as diagnostic or non-diagnostic. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine risk factors for non-diagnostic results, including US visualization score and other clinical covariates.Results:Of the 208 lesions, 85.1% were diagnostic and 14.9% were non-diagnostic. The rates of non-diagnostic results were 8.9%, 25.5%, and 57.1% for scores of A, B, and C, respectively. In the univariable analysis, scores of B or C were associated with a significantly higher rate of nondiagnostic results than scores of A (58.1% vs. 24.9%, PConclusion:US-guided biopsy had a high diagnostic yield for focal hepatic lesions in patients at risk for HCC. US visualization score of B or C, lesion size â‰¤2.0 cm, and high-risk needle pathway usage were independent risk factors for non-diagnostic results.
