Background:Forkhead box C2 (FOXC2) is a crucial factor involving in various cancers. However, its functions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. Here, we explored the role of FOXC2 in the progression of HCC and its potential mechanisms.Methods:FOXC2 expression in HCC tissue and cells were detected by immunohistochemistry or western blot and real-time PCR. CCK8, wound healing and transwell assay were used to measure cell growth and invasion. Tumor formation experiment was carried out to assess the tumorigenicity of HCC cells. Regulation of FOXC2 on Ang-2 was validated by luciferase assay and complementary experiments.Results:Increased FOXC2 expression was found to be associated positively with more aggressive clinicopathologic features. HCC patients with higher FOXC2 expression had significantly shorter overall survival. FOXC2 expression was indentified as an independent risk factor for resectable HCC. Increased FOXC2 expression accelerated the migration and invasion of HCC cells, accompanied by enhanced Ang-2 expression. Likewise, FOXC2 knockdown yielded opposite results. Moreover, FOXC2 stimulated the activation of the Ang-2 promoter. Suppression of Ang-2 expression hindered the FOXC2-mediated EMT processs, cell migration and invasion of HCC.Conclusions:FOXC2 is a novel prognostic predictor for HCC and may facilitate the growth and invasion through Ang-2.
