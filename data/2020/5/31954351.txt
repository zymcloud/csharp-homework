Objectives:This study aims to assess the incidence of incidental activity in the gallbladder and the factors that may contribute to it in a large cohort of patients undergoing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT for cancer evaluation.Methods:8096 PET/CTs were retrospectively reviewed. Data pertaining to patient demographics and PET/CT parameters were collected. Patients' records were reviewed for gallbladder disorders for up to 3 years after the exam. The presence/absence of gallbladder uptake was visually assessed. Findings were classified as focal, diffuse increased and diffuse increased wall uptake, or no uptake. Volumetric measurements of the gallbladder and SUVmax of the gallbladder, liver and blood pool were measured. Chi-square and Student's t-test were used for statistical analysis.Results:54 cases (0.67%) of incidental gallbladder uptake were detected (uptake group). 162 exams without uptake were selected as control (no uptake group). The injection-to-scan interval, SUVmax of the liver and blood pool, and the gallbladder volume did not differ significantly between both groups. Higher blood glucose levels were observed in the uptake (109.9 ± 32.5) vs. no uptake group (97.4 ± 18) (p = 0.01), with levels >150 mg/dL more common in the uptake group (p = 0.004). The incidence of gallbladder disease within 3 years after imaging was higher for the uptake group (12/36) compared to the no uptake group (15/115) (p = 0.02). Diffuse increased wall uptake was more likely in the group who later developed a pathology (4/12) (p = 0.03).Conclusion:Incidental gallbladder uptake in patients is independent of the injected FDG dose, injection-to-scan interval or gallbladder volume, but may be related to blood glucose level. There's a higher incidence of gallbladder pathology three years after the exam particularly in cases of diffuse increased wall uptake.
