Background:Host genome integration of HBV sequence is considered to be significant in HBV antigen expression and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Method:We developed a probe-based capture strategy to enrich integrated HBV DNA for deep-sequencing analysis of integration sites in paired patient samples derived from tumor, liver tissue adjacent to tumor, saliva and plasma, as a platform for exploring the correlation, significance and utility of detecting integrations in these sample types.Results:Most significantly, alpha fetoprotein levels significantly correlated to the amounts of integrations detected in tumor. Viral-host chimeric DNA fragments were successfully detected at high sequencing coverage in plasma rather than saliva samples from HCC patients, and each fragment of this type was only seen once in plasma from chronic hepatitis B patients. Almost all plasma chimeric fragments were derived from integrations in tumor rather than in adjacent liver tissues. Over 50% of them may produce viral-host chimeric transcripts according to deep RNA sequencing in paired tissue samples. Particularly, in patients with low HBV DNA level (Conclusion:We achieve the efficient enrichment of plasma cell-free chimeric DNA from integration site, and demonstrate that chimeric DNA profiling in plasma is a promising noninvasive approach to monitor HBV integration in liver cancer development and to determine the ability of integrated sequences to express viral proteins that can be targeted, e.g. by immunotherapies.
