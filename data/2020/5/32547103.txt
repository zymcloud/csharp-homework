Background:In this study, we aimed to study the effect of FTY720 treatment in reducing circulating Tregs level and then suppressing liver tumor metastasis after hepatectomy and I/R injury in animal models. Furthermore, we also investigated the synergistic anti-tumor effect of FTY720 combined with rapamycin on hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The effect of FTY720 on suppressing Tregs mobilization and tumor metastasis after hepatectomy was investigated in an orthotopic liver tumor rat model with hepatectomy and hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The synergistic anti-tumor effect of FTY720 combined with rapamycin was further explored both in in vitro functional study and in orthotopic liver tumor mouse model.Results:In rat model, hepatic I/R promoted tumor metastasis and increased circulating Tregs after hepatectomy. The treatment of FTY720 reduced liver tumor metastasis and the number of circulating Tregs. Furthermore, FTY720 enhanced the anti-tumor capacity of rapamycin by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and migration in vitro and reducing tumor growth in vivo through suppressing hepatic stellate cell activation and tumor angiogenesis.Conclusion:FTY720 suppressed liver tumor growth and metastasis by reducing the population of circulating Tregs and enhancing the anti-tumor effect of rapamycin. It was suggested that FTY720 single or combined with rapamycin might provide novel insight for suppressing tumor growth and metastasis for HCC patients.
