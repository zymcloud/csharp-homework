Background:Liver fibrosis and cancer are serious hepatic complications for patients with congenital heart diseases. We present a rare case of combined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) (cHCC-CCA) after the repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).Case presentation:A 54-year-old Japanese woman had undergone biventricular repair for TOF at 7 years old. She presented with abdominal distension. Abdominal CT revealed ascites and a 90-mm tumor involving the liver's left lobe. Tumor marker values were: alpha-fetoprotein, 16,208 ng/mL and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin, 33,920 mAU/mL. The preoperative diagnosis was malignant tumor of the liver (e.g., HCC or intrahepatic CCA). We performed a left lobectomy of the liver. Histopathologically, the tumor was composed of two components growing in trabecular and irregular tubular patterns accompanied by a transitional area; the tumor was diagnosed as cHCC-CCA. The non-cancerous area showed fibrous change mainly surrounding a central vein and sinusoid, expanding toward the portal area without inflammation.Conclusions:We provide the details of our patient's cHCC-CCA that developed from fibrous congestive liver associated with right-sided heart failure after TOF repair, diagnosed based on histopathological features. We discuss liver fibrosis as a hepatic complication and a careful follow-up maneuver for improving the outcomes of patients with chronic hepatic congestion.
