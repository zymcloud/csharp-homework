The hypomethylation of the Cyclin D1 (CCND1) promoter induced by excess oxidative stress likely promotes the development of hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC). We aimed to evaluate methylation status of the CCND1 promoter as a new plasma marker for the detection of HBV-HCC.We consecutively recruited 191 participants, including 105 patients with HBV-HCC, 54 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 32 healthy controls (HCs). Using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, we identified the methylation status of the CCND1 promoter in plasma samples. We analyzed the expression levels of the CCND1 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by using quantitative real-time PCR. We assessed the plasma levels of superoxide dismutase, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and malondialdehyde by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.Patients with HBV-HCC (23.81%) presented a reduced methylation frequency compared with patients with CHB (64.81%) or HCs (78.13%) (P
