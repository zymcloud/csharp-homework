Objective:The function of IL-37 in cancer remains largely unclear. The present research was to probe the protein expression of IL-37 and Oct4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), para-cancerous tissues (PT) and cancer cell lines, and discuss their relationship.Methods:Forty-nine HCC specimens and forty-nine PT samples were collected for immunohistochemical staining of IL-37 and Oct4 protein. Then, the correlations among IL-37, Oct4 and the clinical indicators were analyzed. In further in vitro studies, IL-37 was over expressed in HepG2 and MHCC97H cancer cell lines by gene transfection using a lipo3000 kit. Finally, the protein expression of IL-37 and Oct4 was detected by immunofluorescence and western blot to verify the in vivo correlation between IL and 37 and Oct4.Results:In HCC, IL-37 protein expression was weakly positive with a positive rate of 12.2% while Oct4 expression was strongly positive with a positive rate of 91.8%. In PT, strong positive IL-37 (83.7%) and weakly positive Oct4 (91.8%) were shown. The increased IL-37 and decreased Oct4 induced by IL-37 gene transfection were observed through IF in cells. In terms of clinical significance, the difference of IL-37 expression between HCC and PT was statistically significant (χ2 = 51.815, P = 3.2796 × 10-11). IL-37 in tumor tissues was associated with serum AFP (χ2 = 5.515, P = 0.048) and cirrhosis (χ2 = 7.451, P = 0.014). IL-37 expression of PT was link to gender (χ2 = 10.376, P = 0.013) and tumor size (χ2 = 8.118, P = 0.04). The expression of Oct4 in HCC was related to the patient's gender and cirrhosis. Importantly, there was a negative correlation between IL and 37 and Oct4 in tumor tissues (r = -0.299, P = 0.047) but not in PT (P > 0.05). Oct4 protein expression was down-regulated by IL-37 by 63.35% in HepG2 cells (P < 0.05) and 95.20% in MHCC97H cells (P < 0.05).Conclusion:IL-37 expression in tumor tissues and PT was related to serum AFP and liver cirrhosis, tumor size, respectively. IL-37 protein expression was correlated with Oct4 in cancer cell lines and tumor tissues but not PT. The present study indicated that IL-37 might play a role in the development of HCC.
