Background:Combination therapy using hepatic resection (HR) and intra-operative thermal ablation is a treatment approach for patients with technically unresectable liver malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate safety, survival and local recurrence rates for patients with technically unresectable liver tumors undergoing HR and separate percutaneous MR-guided thermoablation procedure as an alternative approach.Methods:Data from all patients with primary or secondary hepatic malignancies treated at a single institution between 2004 and 2018 with combined HR and MR-guided percutaneous thermoablation was collected and retrospectively analyzed. Complications, procedure related information and patient characteristics were collected from institutional records. Overall survival and disease-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:A total of 31 patients (age: 62.8 ± 9.1 years; 10 female) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 7) or hepatic metastases (n = 24) were treated for 98 hepatic tumors. Fifty-six tumors (mean diameter 28.7 ± 23.0 mm) were resected. Forty-two tumors (15.1 ± 7.6 mm) were treated with MR-guided percutaneous ablation with a technical success rate of 100%. Local recurrence at the ablation site occurred in 7 cases (22.6%); none of these was an isolated local recurrence. Six of 17 patients (35.3%) treated for colorectal liver metastases developed local recurrence. Five patients developed recurrence at the resection site (16.1%). Non-local hepatic recurrence was observed in 18 cases (58.1%) and extrahepatic recurrence in 11 cases (35.5%) during follow-up (43.1 ± 26.4 months). Ten patients (32.3%) developed complications after HR requiring pharmacological or interventional treatment. No complication requiring therapy was observed after ablation. Median survival time was 44.0 ± 7.5 months with 1-,3-, 5-year overall survival rates of 93.5, 68.7 and 31.9%, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 38.7, 19.4 and 9.7%, respectively.Conclusion:The combination of HR and MR-guided thermoablation is a safe and effective approach in the treatment of technically unresectable hepatic tumors and can achieve long-term survival.
