Hepatocarcinogenesis is a complicated process that is affected by a variety of microenvironmental factors, such as secretory chemokines and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM). Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-α has been shown to attenuate tumor invasiveness by inducing suppressive cell microenvironment, and its low expression was associated with a worse prognosis in HCC patients. In the present study, we attempted to investigate the role and mechanism of the dominant transcript of ROR-α, ROR-α-1, in HCC development and progression. Among the four transcripts (ROR-α-1/-2/-3/-4), overexpression of ROR-α-1 dramatically suppressed the capacity of MHCC97H cells to proliferate, migrate and invade. We analyzed the differentially expressed genes in ROR-α-1-overexpressed and non-overexpressed MHCC97H cells, performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on these differentially-expressed genes, and found out that factors involved in the tumor microenvironment and ECM are related to the anti-tumor effects of ROR-α-1. Among these factors, chemokine CXCL5 was significantly downregulated by ROR-α-1 overexpression. Overexpression of ROR-α-1 remarkably inhibited the capacity of HCC cells to proliferate, migrate, invade, and downregulated the protein levels of β-catenin, c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and N-cadherin, suggesting the tumor-suppressive role of ROR-α-1 in MHCC97H cells. Moreover, overexpression of CXCL5 dramatically attenuated the suppressive effects of cell proliferation, migration and invasion induced by ROR-α-1 overexpression in MHCC97H, suggesting that ROR-α-1 exerts its anti-tumor effects via downregulating CXCL5. In conclusion, we demonstrate the tumor-suppressive role of ROR-α-1 in MHCC97H cells and that ROR-α-1 might play a tumor-suppressive role via regulation of chemokine CXCL5.
