Objective: To study the effect of sorafenib and prophylactic transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for prevention of postoperative relapse in patients with liver cancer combined with microvascular invasion (MVI) after using radical hepatectomy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 137 cases that underwent radical hepatectomy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from August 2015 to January 2018. Clinical data of liver cancer patients with MVI were diagnosed by postoperative pathology. General data of the three groups were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier was used to calculate the tumor-free survival rate. COX proportional hazards-model was used to analyze the independent risk factors for postoperative recurrence of liver cancer with MVI recurrence. Counting data was compared by x(2) test between groups, and log-rank test was used to compare the tumor-free survival rates. Results: A, B, and C groups had 49, 36, and 52 cases, respectively. General clinicopathological data of the three groups were not statistically significant. The postoperative tumor-free survival rates at 1-, 2-, and 3-years were 71.4%, 51.0%, 38.8%, 86.1%, 75.0%, 66.7%, and 82.7%, 75.0%, and 59.6% respectively in A, B, and C groups. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model showed that patients' age (HR = 0.622, P = 0.046), maximum tumor diameter (HR = 1.661, P = 0.033), prophylactic TACE (HR = 0.544, P = 0.019), and postoperative use of sorafenib (HR = 0.419, 0.222, 0.791, P = 0.007) were independent risk factors for postoperative recurrence of liver cancer with MVI. Conclusion: Sorafenib or prophylactic TACE use can significantly reduce the recurrence rate within 3 years after radical surgery in patients with liver cancer who were confirmed to have MVI by postoperative pathology.
