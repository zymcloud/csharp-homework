Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary hepatic malignancy, which usually arises in cirrhotic liver. When the typical enhancement pattern, consisting of late arterial hyperenhancement followed by washout, is present in nodules larger than 1 cm, HCC can be confidently diagnosed without the need for tissue biopsy. Nevertheless, HCC can display an atypical enhancement pattern, either as iso or hypovascular lesion, or hypervascular lesion without washout. Not only the enhancement pattern of HCC could be atypical, but also a variety of histological types of HCC, such as steatotic, scirrhous, fibrolamellar, or combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma could raise diagnostic dilemmas. In addition, distinct morphological types of HCC or different growth pattern can occur. Awareness of these atypical and rare HCC presentations on magnetic resonance imaging is important for accurate differentiation from other focal liver lesions and timely diagnosis, which allows optimal treatment of patients.
