Background:Since it is currently not possible to eradicate hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with existing treatments, research continues to uncover new therapeutic strategies. HBV core protein, encoded by the HBV core gene (HBC), intervenes in both structural and functional processes, and is a key protein in the HBV life cycle. For this reason, both the protein and the gene could be valuable targets for new therapeutic and diagnostic strategies. Moreover, alterations in the protein sequence could serve as potential markers of disease progression.Aim:To detect, by next-generation sequencing, HBC hyper-conserved regions that could potentially be prognostic factors and targets for new therapies.Methods:Thirty-eight of 45 patients with chronic HBV initially selected were included and grouped according to liver disease stage [chronic hepatitis B infection without liver damage (CHB, n = 16), liver cirrhosis (LC, n = 5), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 17)]. HBV DNA was extracted from patients' plasma. A region between nucleotide (nt) 1863 and 2483, which includes HBC, was amplified and analyzed by next-generation sequencing (Illumina MiSeq platform). Sequences were genotyped by distance-based discriminant analysis. General and intergroup nt and amino acid (aa) conservation was determined by sliding window analysis. The presence of nt insertion and deletions and/or aa substitutions in the different groups was determined by aligning the sequences with genotype-specific consensus sequences.Results:Three nt (nt 1900-1929, 2249-2284, 2364-2398) and 2 aa (aa 117-120, 159-167) hyper-conserved regions were shared by all the clinical groups. All groups showed a similar pattern of conservation, except for five nt regions (nt 1946-1992, 2060-2095, 2145-2175, 2230-2250, 2270-2293) and one aa region (aa 140-160), where CHB and LC, respectively, were less conserved (P < 0.05). Some group-specific conserved regions were also observed at both nt (2306-2334 in CHB and 1935-1976 and 2402-2435 in LC) and aa (between aa 98-103 in CHB and 28-30 and 51-54 in LC) levels. No differences in insertion and deletions frequencies were observed. An aa substitution (P79Q) was observed in the HCC group with a median (interquartile range) frequency of 15.82 (0-78.88) vs 0 (0-0) in the other groups (P < 0.05 vs CHB group).Conclusion:The differentially conserved HBC and HBV core protein regions and the P79Q substitution could be involved in disease progression. The hyper-conserved regions detected could be targets for future therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.
