We attempted to establish an ultrasound (US) imaging-diagnostic system for histopathological grades of differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We conducted a retrospective study of histopathologically confirmed 200 HCCs, classified as early (45 lesions), well- (31 lesions), moderately (68 lesions) or poorly differentiated (diff.) (56 lesions) HCCs. We performed grayscale US to estimate the presence/absence of halo and mosaic signs, Sonazoid contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) to determine vascularity (hypo/iso/hyper) of lesion in arterial and portal phase (PP), and echogenicity of lesion in post-vascular phase (PVP). All findings were of significance for the diagnosis of some (but not all) histological grades (p < 0.001-0.05). Combined findings with a relatively high diagnostic efficacy for early, poorly and moderately diff. HCC were a combination of absence of halo sign and isoechogenicity in PVP of CEUS (accuracy: 93.0%, AUC: 0.908), hypovascularity in PP (accuracy: 78.0%, area under the curve (AUC): 0.750), and a combination of isovascularity in PP and hypoechogenicity in PVP (accuracy: 75.0%, AUC: 0.739), respectively. On the other hand, neither any individual finding nor any combination of findings yielded an AUC of over 0.657 for the diagnosis of well-diff. HCC. Our study provides encouraging data on Sonazoid CEUS in the histological differential diagnosis of HCC, especially in early HCC, and the effectiveness of this imaging method should be further proved by prospective, large sample, multicenter studies.
