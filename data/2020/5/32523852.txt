Cardiac tumors are relatively rare. Secondary cardiac tumors are by far more common than primary cardiac tumors. Cardiac involvement may occur secondary to hematogenous metastases, direct invasion, or tumor growth into the venous system and extension into the right atrium. Patients can present with a spectrum of conditions, including embolization, obstruction of ventricular outflow tracts, direct invasion of myocardium causing impaired myocardial function, invasion of surrounding tissue, interference with valvular function causing valvular regurgitation, or constitutional non-specific signs and symptoms. Imaging modalities are essential for diagnosis. Management is mostly surgical, but can include other medical strategies as well. We present a case of a 65-year-old male with hepatocellular carcinoma with direct invasion to the heart through the venous system.
