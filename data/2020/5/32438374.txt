Background:Regular surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection and hepatitis C (HCV) cirrhosis improves survival by earlier detection of the cancer at an earlier stage when curative intervention may still be possible. We compared patient characteristics, surveillance history and outcomes in patients presenting with advanced HCC secondary to HBV and HCV.Method:In this retrospective study, clinical databases and notes were reviewed in all cases of advanced HCC related to HBV or HCV referred to the tertiary HCC service in Auckland, New Zealand between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2017.Results:Over the 15-year period, 368 patients were referred with advanced HCC secondary to HBV (HBV-HCC) and 278 secondary to HCV (HCV-HCC), representing over 50% of all cases of HCC cases secondary to viral hepatitis. Of these 646 patients with advanced HCC, 75% of patients were not receiving guideline-recommended surveillance. More patients with advanced HBV-HCC were diagnosed with HCC prior to the diagnosis of HBV, compared to patients with advanced HCV-HCC (40% vs 28%, pConclusion:Survival in New Zealanders with hepatocellular carcinoma remains poor because the cancer is incurable in most patients at the time of detection. Because most cases are secondary to chronic hepatitis B and C infections, improved screening and linkage to antiviral therapy and HCC surveillance should improve outcomes.
