Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading form of chronic liver disease, with few biomarkers and treatment options currently available. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a progressive disease of NAFLD, may lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Epigenetic modification can contribute to the progression of NAFLD causing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which the exact role of epigenetics remains poorly understood. To identify potential therapeutics for NASH, we tested small-molecule inhibitors of the epigenetic target histone methyltransferase EZH2, Tazemetostat (EPZ-6438), and UNC1999 in STAM NASH mice. The results demonstrate that treatment with EZH2 inhibitors decreased serum TNF-alpha in NASH. In this study, we investigated that inhibition of EZH2 reduced mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis markers in NASH mice. In conclusion, these results suggest that EZH2 may present a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of NASH.
