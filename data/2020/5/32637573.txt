Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor. LukS-PV is the S component of Panton-Valetine leukocidin (PVL), which is secreted by Staphylococcus aureus. This study investigated the effects of LukS-PV on the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell-cycle progression of HCC cells and the mechanisms of its activity. The HCC cells were treated with different LukS-PV concentrations in vitro. Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were used to study cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to measure apoptosis and cell-cycle progression. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and western blot assays were used to determine mRNA and protein expression levels. Xenograft experiments were performed to determine the in vivo antitumor effect of LukS-PV. Immunostaining was performed to analyze Ki-67 and HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2) expression. Our results showed that LukS-PV inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in HCC cell lines. LukS-PV also can induce cell-cycle arrest. Moreover, we discovered that LukS-PV attenuated HDAC2 expression and upregulated PTEN; phosphorylated AKT was also reduced. Further studies demonstrated that LukS-PV treatment significantly reduced tumor growth in nude mice and suppressed Ki-67 and HDAC2 levels. Our data revealed a vital role of LukS-PV in suppressing HCC progression by downregulating HDAC2 and upregulating PTEN.
