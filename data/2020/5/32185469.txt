Background:This study assesses survival improvement across a decade (2004-2013) among patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers in a real-world setting.Methods:Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was accessed and patients with metastatic gastrointestinal carcinomas who have received any form of systemic therapy were included. Patients were grouped into three cohorts based on the year of diagnosis (cohort-1: 2004-2006; cohort-2: 2008-2010; cohort-3: 2012-2013). Overall survival was compared among the three cohorts for each disease site using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates.Results:A total of 54,992 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers were included in the current analysis. Using Kaplan-Meier survival comparison for the three temporal cohorts, the following survival observations were noted: for patients with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma: median survival for cohort-1: 8 months, cohort-2: 9 months, cohort-3: 9 months; P Conclusion:Limited (if any) survival improvement has been observed among patients with metastatic gastrointestinal carcinomas treated with systemic therapy in the decade from 2004 to 2013.
