Background:Several studies have reported that solid organ transplant recipients have a high risk for malignant tumors because the suppressed immune system fails in preventing malignant transformations. De novo malignancy after transplantation is the most common cause of death in the late period after liver transplant (LT). This study investigated the clinical significance of de novo malignancy after LT, and it is the largest study based in Korea to report long-term follow-up results associated with de novo malignancy after LT.Methods:Data of 1793 adults who underwent LT in Seoul National University Hospital were retrospectively collected, and medical charts and data from the Ministry of Public Administration and Security were reviewed to examine the causes of death and de novo malignancy status. The Fisher exact test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to analyze the data.Results:Of the 1793 recipients, 27 died of de novo malignancies. Of 875 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, 12 died, and of 918 non-HCC patients, 15 died. De novo malignancy was the main cause of death at 5 years after LT but was not in the initial 5 years. In Korea the most common cancers that developed after LT were gastric cancer (21.4%) and lymphoma (14.3%). De novo HCC in non-HCC cases was found in 2 patients.Conclusion:De novo malignancy is a key factor affecting long-term survival after LT. Therefore, regular screening and education are important for improving long-term survival and quality of life in these patients after LT.
