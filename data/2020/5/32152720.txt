Purpose:The objective was to evaluate the local treatment efficacy of transarterial ethanol ablation (TEA) as compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This was a retrospective study between January 2005 and April 2017, in which the treatment outcomes of all patients who received either percutaneous TEA or RFA for HCC tumors of size â‰¤ 3 cm, of Child-Pugh grade A or B, received no prior treatment other than surgical resection, were compared. For TEA, a mixture of absolute ethanol and ethiodized oil at a proportion of 1:2 by volume was administered superselectively into the tumor via a microcatheter placed at the feeding arteries. The TEA group and the RFA group consisted of 68 consecutive patients (88 treated target tumors) and 129 consecutive patients (129 tumors), respectively.Results:Technical success was achieved in all the target tumors in both groups. Grade 3 complication (CIRSE Classification) of prolonged fever occurred in 3 cases with multi-focal and large tumors in the TEA group. There was no statistically significant difference in complete response rate between the TEA group (84/88 or 95.5%) and the RFA group (188/195 or 96.4%) (p = 0.7). Time to progression in the TEA group [median 11.9 months, interquartile range (IQR) 5.6-18 months] was not statistically different from that in the RFA group (median 9.5 months, IQR 3.5-18.7 months) (p = 0.773).Conclusion:TEA could be an effective alternative of RFA for the local treatment of small HCC; it is especially valuable for tumors of unfavorable location.
