Objective:To evaluate the preliminary clinical effective of open decompression, microwave ablation combined with open vertebroplasty and pedicle screw rod system in the treatment of spine metastases.Methods:The clinical data of 12 patients with spine metastases were retrospectively analyzed, they were treated with open decompression, microwave ablation combined with open vertebroplasty and pedicle screw rod system between January 2014 and January 2016. Six males and 6 females were included, aged from 30 to 75 years old with an average of 55.6 years. There were 5 cases with spine metastases from lung cancer, 2 from breast cancer, 2 from thyroid cancer, 2 from renal cancer and 1 from liver cancer. Sevencases were thoracic metastases and 5 cases were lumbar metastases. Tomita score were mainly arranging from 3 to 6 points. According to ASIA neurologic grading system, 3 patients were grade C, 1 was grade D, 8 were grade E. Preoperative VAS score was 8.3±0.4. VAS was used to evaluate the clinical effect at 1, 3, 6 months after operation and final follow-up.Results:All operations were successful and the amount of blood loss during surgery was 500 to 2 050 ml (average of 850 ml), operation time was 3.5 to 5.5 h (average of 4.5 h). There was no nerve root injury during surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred in 3 cases after surgery, which were healed after conservative treatment. Superficial infection of the incision occurred in 2 cases, which were healed after dressing change. There was one case of pulmonary infection. No deep infection, lower limb thrombosis or other complications were found. All 12 patients were followed up for 9 -40 months with an average of 28.6 months. The clinical symptoms of all patients were significantly improved, and the motor function of the lower limbs was recovered to varying degrees. According to ASIA grade, 2 cases of grade C were improved to grade B;1 case of grade C did not recover significantly;1 case of grade D was improved to grade E. One patient died of primary liver cancer 10 months after surgery. Local tumor recurrence occurred in 1 patient during follow up period. The VAS scores were 2.7±0.6, 2.5±0.4, 2.6±0.5, and 2.5±0.5 at 1, 3, 6 months after surgery and at final follow-up, which were significantly improved compared with the score before surgery(P<0.05).Conclusion:Open decompression, microwave ablation combined with open vertebroplasty and pedicle screw rod system in the treatment of spine metastases show some effects, with less intraoperative blood loss, shorter operation time, significant postoperative pain relief, and low tumor recurrence rate.
