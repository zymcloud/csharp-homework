Recent advancement in the immunological understanding of genesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has implicated a decline in anti-tumour immunity on the background of chronic inflammatory state of liver parenchyma. The development of HCC involves a network of immunological activity in the tumour microenvironment involving continuous interaction between tumour and stromal cells. The reduction in anti-tumour immunity is secondary to changes in various immune cells and cytokines, and the tumour microenvironment plays a critical role in modulating the process of liver fibrosis, hepatocarcinogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor invasion and metastasis. Thus, it is considered as one of primary factor behind the despicable tumour behavior and observed poor survival; along with increased risk of recurrence following treatment in HCC. The primary intent of the present review is to facilitate the understanding of the complex network of immunological interactions of various immune cells, cytokines and tumour cells associated with the development and progression of HCC.
