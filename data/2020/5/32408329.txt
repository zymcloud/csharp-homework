A 50s man was diagnosed with esophagogastric junction cancer. Simultaneously, PET-CT demonstrated mediastinal lymph node metastases. Two months later, 4 courses of systemic chemotherapy(SOX)were provided as preoperative therapy. However, the outcome was PD; therefore, radical gastrectomy could not be performed. Two more months later, esophageal dysphagia developed. Mediastinal lymph nodes that compressed the esophagus and the primary lesion of the cardia were considered to be the causes of dysphagia, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization targeting those 2 lesions was performed. Cisplatin 20 mg, docetaxel 20 mg, and 5-FU 250mg were the drugs administered. These drugs were injected from the right bronchial artery, left gastric artery, and left phrenic artery, followed by mild embolization with HepaSphereTM. The mediastinal lymph nodes shrunk significantly, and dysphagia improved with 2 sessions. The primary lesion was found to have reduced in size with 6 sessions. Currently, no regrowth of the mediastinal lymph nodes has been observed 16 months(9 sessions) after the first session, and control of the primary lesion has been obtained.
