Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver diseases such as steatosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV particles have been found to associate with apolipoproteins, and apolipoproteins not only participate in the HCV life cycle, but also help HCV escape recognition by the host immune system, which pose challenges for the development of both HCV treatments and vaccines. However, no study has reported on the comprehensive identification of apolipoprotein associations with HCV particles. In the present study, we performed proteome analysis by affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to comprehensively identify the apolipoprotein associations with HCV particles, and ApoM was first identified by AP-MS besides the previously reported ApoE, ApoB, ApoA-I and ApoC-I. Additionally, three assays further confirmed that ApoM was a novel virus particle associated protein. We also showed that ApoM was required for HCV production, especially for the assembly/release step of HCV life cycle. Furthermore, ApoM interacted with the HCV E2 protein. Finally, HCV infection reduced ApoM expression both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our study demonstrates that ApoM, identified as a novel HCV particle associated protein, contributes to HCV assembly/release and interacts with HCV E2 protein. It provides new insights on how HCV and the host apolipoproteins are reciprocally influenced and lays a basis for research in developing innovative antiviral strategies.
