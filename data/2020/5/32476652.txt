Background:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a serum tumor marker used in the past for surveillance and screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis. Its prognostic value is still debated in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of the AFP rate at diagnosis on the overall survival of patients with a small HCC (Patients and methods:Among the 122 patients diagnosed with HCC during the study period, 49 patients had a small HCC at diagnosis, including 40,8% (N 20) patients with a negative AFP (group I) and 59,18% (N 29) with an AFP >10 ng / ml (group II). Both groups of patients were comparable for age and WHO status (World Health Organization). Patient survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The survival at 5 years was 35.7% in group 1 vs 12.3% in group 2. The AFP level was identified as an independent prognostic factor of survival.Conclusion:Alpha-fetoprotein serum positivity seems to have prognostic value in patients with single small HCC.
