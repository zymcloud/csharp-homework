Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) is one of the most common malignancies in clinical practice. According to the "Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Liver Cancer in China," PHC, at an early stage, can be treated by surgical resection and ablation. Surgical resection basically consists of two ways; one is open hepatectomy (OH), and the other is laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH), which is a newly developed technique associated with advantages of open surgery. Ablation, also known as percutaneous thermal ablation using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA), is a minimally invasive curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. This preliminary report was aimed at evaluating the postoperative outcome of the patients undergoing these three therapeutic methods, respectively. The study analyzed the data of 95 patients who underwent LH, OH, or ablation between June 2018 and June 2019 at First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. There were 20 patients in the ablation group, 35 patients in the OH group, and 40 patients in the LH group. Among the three groups, the postoperative short-term outcome was the best in the ablation group, suggesting that it was a safe and cheap way to treat PHC at an early stage.
