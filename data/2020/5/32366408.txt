Background/aim:There is rapid progression and widespread use of patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) in translational pancreatic cancer research. This study aimed to establish a liver transplant PDX model using cryopreserved primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Patients and methods:Primary PDAC from 10 patients were cryopreserved and transplanted into immunodeficient mice using the liver pocket method. H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining, such as Ki-67, p53, Smad4, and MUC1 were used to evaluate engraftment and histological similarities.Results:Patient-derived xenograft placement was successful in six cases (60%), and 10 mice (33.3%). The Ki-67 index of primary PDAC and the cryopreservation duration were significantly related to successful engraftment (p=0.003 and p=0.007, respectively).Conclusion:In this study, we succeeded in establishing a liver transplant PDX mouse model as a preclinical platform. The successful engraftment was affected by the cryopreservation duration and could be detected by the Ki-67 index.
