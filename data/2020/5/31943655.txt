Background:Liver resection is a well-recognized modality for hepatocellular carcinoma. Cirrhotic patients are more prone to adverse consequences after liver resection. This work assesses the prognostic significance of sarcopenic hepatocellular carcinoma cases for whom surgical resection was performed.Methods:The present prospective work included 52 cirrhotic cases. Computed tomography scans were used to determine the skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the plane of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). L3 SMI was used for the definition of sarcopenia. The primary outcome measure was the predictive value of sarcopenia for 1-year post-hepatectomy mortality.Results:Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 27 patients (51.9%). All patients had a Child-Turcotte-Pugh score A. At a 1-year follow-up, 20 cases died; that is the 1-year mortality rate was 38.5%. Sarcopenia was more commonly associated with older age and non-viral causes of cirrhosis. The risk of 1-year mortality is 7.6 times higher in sarcopenic patients with a risk ratio of 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.4-9.6).Conclusion:Sarcopenia diagnosed using L3 SMI is an independent prognostic factor for 1-year deaths in cases with hepatic malignancy with Child-Turcotte-Pugh score A undergoing surgical resection.
