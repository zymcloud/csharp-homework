Rearrangements involving the mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) are found in the majority of leukemias that develop within the first year of age, known as infant leukemias, and likely originate during prenatal life. MLL rearrangements are also present in about 10% of other pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). These translocations and others occurring in early life are associated with a dismal prognosis compared with adult leukemias carrying the same translocations. This observation suggests that infant and adult leukemias are biologically distinct but the underlying molecular mechanisms for these differences are not understood. In this work, we induced the same MLL chromosomal translocation in the embryo at the time of fetal liver hematopoiesis and in the adult hematopoietic tissues to develop disease models in mice that recapitulate human infant and adult leukemias, respectively. We successfully obtained myeloid leukemia in adult mice after MLL-ENL recombination induction using the interferon inducible Mx1-Cre line. Using this same Cre line, we generated embryonic MLL-ENL leukemias, which were more aggressive than the corresponding adult leukemias. In conclusion, we have developed a novel MLL-ENL embryonic leukemia model in mice that can be used to study some aspects of infant leukemia ontogeny.
