Background:In Western countries, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis B (HBV) patients without cirrhosis was poorly studied. The aim was to describe the characteristics and outcome of HBV-related HCC according to fibrosis stage.Method:All patients with chronic HBV infection and HCC discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board between 2007 and 2017 were retrospectively included.Results:A total of 152 out of 2,038 HCC patients had underlying HBV infection. HBV viral load>2000IU/ml, positive HBeAg and Hepatitis D coinfection were observed in 41%, 13% and 13% of cases, respectively. HCC was uninodular in 53%, associated with portal thrombosis in 16% and/or metastasis in 9% of cases. 130 patients (86%) had cirrhosis. No difference regarding HCC risk factors and viral characteristics was observed according to fibrosis stage. 5-year survival was 48%(47% on cirrhosis versus 57% without cirrhosis, P=0.26). At HCC diagnosis, 47% and 32% of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients received an antiviral treatment (AVT), which was associated with less aggressive tumor and better survival (P=0.005). In cirrhosis, screening was associated with a lower tumor burden and patients were more amenable to curative treatment with better outcome (PConclusion:HBV represents 8% of HCC etiologies without differences of viral characteristics according to fibrosis stage. AVT and surveillance were associated with less aggressive tumors, better access to curative treatment and outcome.
