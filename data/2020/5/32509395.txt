Treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still confronts great challenges due to high rate of therapeutic resistance. The emergence of systemic treatment with molecular targeted and immune checkpoint therapies has brought novel approaches towards patients with advanced HCC. However, sorafenib, as the first approved systemic treatment in 2007, only increased overall survival by three months in advanced HCC patients. Afterwards, little progress has been made for molecular targeted agents. Only four molecular drugs are empirically used in clinical practice. Lenvatinib acts as a first-line drug, whereas regorafenib, ramucirumab, and cabozantinib are defined as second-line drugs. Nevertheless, clinical findings reveal that overall survival remains unchanged. Albeit immunotherapy-based approaches are currently considered promising therapeutic strategies for advanced HCC, a minority of patients could benefit from them. These beneficiaries are to be accordingly identified. Combined immunotherapies with matched molecular targeted treatments would be a novel breakthrough. Herein, we summarize the current statuses of immunotherapies and molecular targeted drug therapies, and mainly identify clinically feasible chemoimmunotherapeutic strategies.
