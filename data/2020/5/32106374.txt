Ganoderma lucidum has salutary effects on tumor treatment, including pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Ganoderma lucidum therapy is obscure. In this study, the Hepa1-6-bearing C57 BL/6 mouse model was utilized to explore the therapeutic efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum extract (GLE), documenting that it could effectively inhibit tumor growth. The microRNA (miRNA) profiles of GLE-treated and untreated mice were detected, and 25 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were determined, including 24 up-expressed and one down-expressed miRNAs. Using the ClusterOne algorithm, 8 hub miRNAs were isolated from the established miRNA-target network. The qRT-PCR assay demonstrated that these 8 miRNAs were up-expressed in the GLE treated tumor mice. Furthermore, the mRNA profiles showed that there are 76 DE mRNAs between GLE treated and model groups. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network shows that Cntn1, Irs1, Nfkbia, Rybp and Ywhaz playing important roles, and qRT-PCR further revealed they were down-expressed in GLE treated Hepa1-6-bearing C57 BL/6 mice. The rebuilt miRNA-target network was shown that these 5 mRNAs were regulated by mmu-mir-23a-5p, -3102-3p, -337-3p, and -467a-3p, respectively. This study suggested that these 4 interesting miRNAs were potential biomarkers for evaluation of GLE efficacy, which may down-regulate the expression of Cntn1, Irs1, Nfkbia, Rybp and Ywhaz, and mediate many signaling pathways occurring in tumor treatment.
