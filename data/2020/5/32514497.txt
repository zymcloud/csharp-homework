While metabolic syndrome and alcohol consumption are the two main causes of chronic liver disease, one of the two conditions is often predominant, with the other acting as a cofactor of morbimortality. It has been shown that obesity and alcohol act synergistically to increase the risk of fibrosis progression, hepatic carcinogenesis and mortality, while genetic polymorphisms can strongly influence disease progression. Based on common pathogenic pathways, there are several potential targets that could be used to treat both diseases; based on the prevalence and incidence of these diseases, new therapies and clinical trials are needed urgently.
