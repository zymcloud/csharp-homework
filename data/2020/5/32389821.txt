Background:Liver fibrosis is a major medical problem with high mortality and morbidity rates where the formation of regenerative nodules and cirrhosis leads to loss of liver function and may result in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Bone marrow Mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have drawn attention as a novel approach for treatment of liver fibrosis. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of BM-MSCs on the liver structure in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced liver fibrosis in male rats relative to resveratrol and Silybum marianum as standard drugs derived from herbal plants.Methods:Fifty adult male albino rats (Sprague Dawley strain; 180-220 g mean body weight) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Unit in the Nile Center of Experimental Research, Mansoura, Egypt. Liver function were detrmined, isolation and preparation of BM- MSCs and detection of cell-surface markers by flow cytometry.Results:Animals exposed to CCl4 developed liver injury characterized by significant increase of liver enzymes, malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and CYP450, inhibition of antioxidant enzymes, and decreased albumin. Treatment with stem cells enhanced liver state more effectively than resveratrol and Silybum marianum. It significantly decreased AST, ALT, ALP, MDA, TNF-α, and CYP450 and increased albumin, SOD, GSH, GST, and CAT. Histopathological study and atomic force microscope results confirmed the therapeutic effects of MSCs.Conclusions:BM-MSCs could restore liver structure and function in CCL4 induced liver fibrosis rat model, ameliorating the toxicity of CCl4 and improving liver function tests.
