Background and aims:Radioembolization (yttrium-90 [Y90]) is used in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a bridging as well as downstaging liver-directed therapy to curative liver transplantation (LT). In this study, we report long-term outcomes of LT for patients with HCC who were bridged/downstaged by Y90.Approach and results:Patients undergoing LT following Y90 between 2004 and 2018 were included, with staging by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) tumor-node-metastasis criteria at baseline pre-Y90 and pre-LT. Post-Y90 toxicities were recorded. Histopathological data of HCC at explant were recorded. Long-term outcomes, including overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-specific mortality (DSM), and time-to-recurrence, were reported. Time-to-endpoint analyses were estimated using Kaplan-Meier. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a log-rank test and Cox proportional-hazards model, respectively. During the 15-year period, 207 patients underwent LT after Y90. OS from LT was 12.5 years, with a median time to LT of 7.5 months [interquartile range, 4.4-10.3]. A total of 169 patients were bridged, whereas 38 were downstaged to LT. Respectively, 94 (45%), 60 (29%), and 53 (26%) patients showed complete, extensive, and partial tumor necrosis on histopathology. Three-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS rates were 84%, 77%, and 60%, respectively. Twenty-four patients developed recurrence, with a median RFS of 120 (95% confidence interval, 69-150) months. DSM at 3, 5, and 10 years was 6%, 11%, and 16%, respectively. There were no differences in OS/RFS for patients who were bridged or downstaged. RFS was higher in patients with complete/extensive versus partial tumor necrosis (P Conclusions:Y90 is an effective treatment for HCC in the setting of bridging/downstaging to LT. Patients who achieved extensive or complete necrosis had better RFS, supporting the practice of neoadjuvant treatment before LT.
