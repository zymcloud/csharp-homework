Tumor cells primarily utilize aerobic glycolysis for energy production, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect, but the involvement of Warburg effect in liver cancer cell metastasis is not well understood. In present study, our results indicate a positive correlation between glucose metabolism level and metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We also observed that a long noncoding RNA-SOX2OT (lncRNA-SOX2OT) can not only increase the metastatic potential of HCC but also promote a pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)-mediated activation of glucose metabolism. Inhibition of PKM2 in HCC cells greatly compromises lncRNA-SOX2OT in promoting Warburg effect and metastasis. Furthermore, miR-122-5p was found being a direct target of lncRNA-SOX2OT in regulating PKM2 expression. Thus, our findings reveal that lncRNA-SOX2OT, a regulator of PKM2, could predispose HCC patients to metastases and may serve as a candidate for metastatic prediction and therapies in HCC patients.
