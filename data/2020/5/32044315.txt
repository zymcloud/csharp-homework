Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, affecting 20%-25% of the adult population. In 25% of patients, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which increases the risk for the development of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In patients with NASH, liver fibrosis is the main determinant of mortality. Here, we review how interactions between different liver cells culminate in fibrosis development in NASH, focusing on triggers and consequences of hepatocyte-macrophage-hepatic stellate cell (HSC) crosstalk. We discuss pathways through which stressed and dead hepatocytes instigate the profibrogenic crosstalk with HSC and macrophages, including the reactivation of developmental pathways such as TAZ, Notch, and hedgehog; how clearance of dead cells in NASH via efferocytosis may affect inflammation and fibrogenesis; and insights into HSC and macrophage heterogeneity revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing. Finally, we summarize options to therapeutically interrupt this profibrogenic hepatocyte-macrophage-HSC network in NASH.
