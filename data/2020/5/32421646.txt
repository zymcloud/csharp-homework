In this paper, the effects of the input power of a microwave antenna (MWAN) on liver cancer tissue when injected with Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs) are studied. First, for basic simulation, we validated our results by comparison with other literature data. After that, we used a 1.8-cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor, which was treated experimentally for 3-min ablation using MWAN operating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz with a power of 90 W. At the next step of the simulation, the obtained results were compared with experimental results. As a last step, the effects of various MWAN input powers on the tumor after injection of MNPs were studied. Our results show that MNPs can be used as excellent heat sources and reduce input power significantly to produce a similar hyperthermia. When maghemite Î³-Fe2O3 MNPs are used, the input power decreases from 90 W to 35 W. In addition, it has been shown that using a higher external magnetic field can treat a larger tumor. The optimized simulated values of the external magnetic field and the input microwave power are 15 mT and 35 W, respectively.
