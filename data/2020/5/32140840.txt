Objective:To evaluate yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolization outcomes across Child-Pugh scores in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:From April 2005 to December 2018, 106 consecutive patients with BCLC Stage C HCC who underwent Y90 radioembolization were retrospectively analyzed. Exclusion criteria included additional malignancy (n = 7), death unrelated to liver disease (n = 2), metastases (n = 2), or lack of follow-up data (n = 4). Ninety-one patients were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups with the log-rank test. Cox regression modeling was used to evaluate the prognostic factors for survival.Results:Mean age was 63 years and 85.7% were male. HCV infection was the most common etiology of liver disease (58.2%). Sixty-four (70.3%) patients were Child-Pugh A, 19 (20.9%) patients were B7, and eight (8.8%) patients were B8-9. Median OS after radioembolization was 20.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.0-27.4], 6.0 (95% CI 4.4-7.6), and 5.5 (95% CI 2.5-8.5) months for Child-Pugh A, B7, and B8/9 groups, respectively (P Conclusions:Outcomes from Y90 for BCLC C HCC for Child-Pugh B7 patients were equivalent to B8/9 patients and significantly worse compared to Child-Pugh A patients. Although further research is warranted, these results suggest continued cautious patient selection for radioembolization in advanced HCC.
