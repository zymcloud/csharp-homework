Objective: This study aimed at investigating the specific roles of laminarin from seaweed (Laminaria japonica) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its potential mechanisms related to senescence marker protein-30 (SMP-30). Materials and Methods: Human HCC cell lines, including Bel-7404 and HepG2, were incubated with different concentrations of laminarin (0, 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 mg/mL). The cell viability and apoptosis rates were detected by WST-8 cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Hepa 1-6 tumor-bearing mice were injected with different concentrations of laminarin (400, 800, and 1200 mg/kgÂ·d), and tumor volume and weight were measured. The expression of SMP-30 was detected in laminarin-treated Bel-7404 and HepG2 HCC cells and LO2 normal liver cells by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Results: The treatment with laminarin (48 h) significantly decreased the viability and increased the apoptosis rates of Bel-7404 and HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The injection of laminarin also significantly decreased the tumor volumes (beginning on the 10th day) and tumor weights (30 d post-injection) of mice in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the treatment with laminarin (35 mg/mL for 48 h) significantly upregulated SMP-30 in Bel-7404 and HepG2 cells but not in LO2 cells. Conclusion: Laminarin inhibited the proliferation of Bel-7404 and HepG2 cells and inhibited the growth of tumors in Hepa 1-6 tumor-bearing mice by upregulating SMP-30.
