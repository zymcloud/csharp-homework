Objective:To evaluate the diagnostic value of abnormal prothrombin (DCP) in Alpha-fetoproteins (AFP)-negative (AFP≤20 ng/mL) hepatocellular carcinoma and the relationship between DCP level and Child-Pugh grade, tumor size, TNM stage as well as differentiation.Methods:The inpatients diagnosed with hepatitis B-related liver disease were collected from June 2016 to December 2017, The diagnostic efficacy of DCP for AFP-negative HCC was analyzed by ROC. Area under the curve ( AUC), the best cut point, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated. The relationship between DCP levels and the clinical characteristic of HCC was analyzed.Results:A total of 459 hepatitis B markers positive patients were included, including 136 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 173 cases of hepatitis B cirrhosis and 150 cases of chronic hepatitis B. DCP in AFP-negative hepatocellular carcinoma group was significantly higher than that in non-HCC group (CHB and LC) ( P<0.05). The AUC of DCP was 0.858, P<0.05. The optimal cut-off point for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was 61 mAU/mL. The corresponding sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 72.8%, 88.2%, 61.1% and 89.7%, respectively. In different size of hepatocellular carcinoma, DCP level of those with diameter>3 cm was significantly higher than those with diameter≤3 cm ( P<0.05). In different TNM stages, DCP level in stage Ⅱ and Ⅲ was significantly higher than that in stage Ⅰ ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference of DCP level among different Child-Pugh grades and differentiation ( P>0.05).Conclusion:DCP has diagnostic value for AFP-negative hepatocellular carcinoma, its level may reflects the degree of tumor progression.
