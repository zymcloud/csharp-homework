Objective:The risk difference between multiphase multidetector contrast-enhanced CT and MRI for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been previously evaluated in patients with cirrhosis undergoing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance. We aimed to compare the rate of AKI after CT and MRI for evaluation of these lesions.Design:A retrospective chart review of all patients with cirrhosis who underwent either multiphase multidetector liver protocol CT or MRI for lesions detected on HCC screening was conducted at West Virginia University. The rate of AKI after imaging was compared between the two groups.Results:A total of 416 patients were included. Hepatitis C was the most common aetiology (34.6%) of cirrhosis. Thirty-six patients had chronic kidney disease at the time of imaging. CT imaging was conducted for 173 (41.5%) patients, while 58.5% underwent MRI. Nineteen (4.6%) patients developed AKI after imaging. The incidence of AKI was 2.89% for CT and 5.76% for MRI (p value = 0.25). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that inpatient status (p value = 0.015) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (p value = 0.02) were independently linked to the development of AKI following imaging, while the type of imaging modality was not.Conclusions:There is no difference in the risk of AKI after CT or MRI for evaluation of lesions identified on HCC surveillance. The rates of AKI after these imaging studies are low and are attributable to other aetiologies in most cases. We propose that the choice of imaging should be made based on availability, cost, and other patient-related and facility-related factors.
