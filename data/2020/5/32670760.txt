The spatial heterogeneity of immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive. Here, a single-cell study involving 17 432 600 immune cells of 39 matched HCC (T), nontumor (N), and leading-edge (L) specimens by mass cytometry is conducted. The tumor-associated CD4/CD8 double-positive T (DPT) cells are found enriched in L regions with synergetic expression of PD-1/HLA-DR/ICOS/CD45RO and exhibit a higher level of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and PD-1 upon stimulation. The enrichment of DPT and PD-1+DPT in L regions indicates favorable prognosis. These tumor-associated DPT cells with similar phenotype are also verified in other tumors and HCC animal models. Single-cell RNA-seq further characterizes the molecular features of DPT cells and uncovers 11 clusters with different cytotoxicity, exhaustion, and activation scores. TCR-based trajectory analysis reveals that tumor-associated DPT clusters share separated ancestries with local CD4+ or CD8+SPT cells rather than CD3+PBMC cells. TCR clones with frequency above 10 are mainly found coexisting in DPT and CD8+SPT cells. Specifically, PD-1highDPT cluster (TDPT_10) shares the same ancestry with exhausted CD8+SPT cluster (TCD8T_2) and shows higher expression similarity and closer pathological location to PD-1+CD8+ than PD-1+CD4+T cells. Together, this study systematically characterizes the unique distribution of PD-1+DPTs in HCC and puts forward new insights for the function and origin of tumor-associated DPT cells.
