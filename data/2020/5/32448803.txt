Background:It is now recognized that many anticancer treatments positively modulate the antitumor immune response. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that inhibitors of the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) reduce tumor progression and are associated with better outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer. RAS components are expressed by most immune cells and adult hematopoietic cells, thus are potential targets for modulating tumor-infiltrating immune cells and can provide a mechanism of tumor control by the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi).Aim:To investigate the effects of the RASi captopril on tumor T lymphocyte distribution in a mouse model of colorectal liver metastases.Methods:Liver metastases were established in a mouse model using an autologous colorectal cancer cell line. RASi (captopril 750 mg/kg) or carrier (saline) was administered to the mice daily via intraperitoneal injection, from day 1 post-tumor induction to endpoint (day 15 or 21 post-tumor induction). At the endpoint, tumor growth was determined, and lymphocyte infiltration and composition in the tumor and liver tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC).Results:Captopril significantly decreased tumor viability and impaired metastatic growth. Analysis of infiltrating T cells into liver parenchyma and tumor tissues by IHC and flow cytometry showed that captopril significantly increased the infiltration of CD3+ T cells into both tissues at day 15 following tumor induction. Phenotypical analysis of CD45+ CD3+ T cells indicated that the major contributing phenotype to this influx is a CD4 and CD8 double-negative T cell (DNT) subtype, while CD4+ T cells decreased and CD8+ T cells remained unchanged. Captopril treatment also increased the expression of checkpoint receptor PD-1 on CD8+and DNT subsets .Conclusion:Captopril treatment modulates the immune response by increasing the infiltration and altering the phenotypical composition of T lymphocytes and may be a contributing mechanism for tumor control.
