Background:RNA methylation modifying plays an important role in the occurrence and progression of a range of human cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is characterized by a mass of genetic and epigenetic alterations. However, the treatment targeting these alterations is limited.Methods:We used comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to analyze the correlation between cancer-associated RNA methylation regulators and HCC malignant features in network datasets.Results:We identified two HCC subgroups (cluster 1 and 2), which have clearly distinct clinicopathological, biofunctional and prognostic characteristics, by consensus clustering. The cluster 2 subgroup correlated with malignancy of the primary tumor, higher tumor stage, higher histopathological grade and higher frequency of TP53 mutation, as well as with a shorter survival when compared with cluster 1. Gene enrichment indicated that the cluster 2 correlated to the tumor malignancy signaling and biological processes. Based on these findings, an 11-gene risk signature was built, which not only is an independent prognostic marker but also has an excellent power to predict the tumor features.Conclusions:Our study indicated that RNA methylation regulators are vital for HCC malignant progression and provide an important evidence for RNA methylation, methylation regulators are actionable targets for anticancer drug discovery.
