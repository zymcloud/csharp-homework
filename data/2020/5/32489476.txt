Background and aim: Refractoriness to transarterial chemoembolization is common during the therapeutic process of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is an intractable issue and may compromise the prognosis. We aim to establish a pre-treatment model to identify patients with high risks of refractoriness. Methods: From 2010 to 2016, 824 treatment-naive patients who had initially underwent at least two sessions of transarterial chemoembolization in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were retrospectively enrolled. These patients were randomly allocated into a training cohort and a validation cohort. The pre-treatment scoring model was established based on the clinical and radiological variables using logistic regression and nomogram. The discrimination and calibration of the model were also evaluated. Results: Logistic regression identified vascularization pattern, ALBI grade, serum alpha-fetoprotein level, serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase level and major tumor size as the key parameters related to refractoriness. The p-TACE model was established using these variables (risk score range: 0-19.5). Patients were divided into six risk subgroups based on their scores (<4, ≥4, ≥7, ≥10, ≥13, ≥16). The discriminative ability, as determined by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.784 (95% confidence interval: 0.741-0.827) in the training cohort and 0.743 (95% confidence interval: 0.696-0.789) in the validation cohort. Moreover, satisfactory calibration was confirmed by Hosmer-Lemeshow test with P values of 0.767 and 0.913 in the training cohort and validation cohort. Conclusions: This study presents a pre-treatment model to identify patients with high risks of refractoriness after transarterial chemoembolization and shed light on clinical decision making.
