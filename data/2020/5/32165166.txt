Tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs) are involved in the tumorigenesis, progression, drug resistance and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanism for the propagation of liver T-ICs remains unclear. Herein, we find that miR-454 is upregulated in liver T-ICs and has an important function in liver T-ICs. Functional studies have revealed that knockdown of miR-454 inhibits liver T-IC self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Conversely, forced miR-454 expression promotes liver T-IC self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, we found that miR-454 downregulates SOCS6 expression in liver T-ICs. The correlation between miR-454 and SOCS6 is validated in human HCC tissues. Furthermore, HCC cells that overexpress miR-454 are resistant to sorafenib treatment. Analysis of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) further demonstrates that miR-454 may predict sorafenib benefits in HCC patients. In conclusion, our findings reveal the crucial role of miR-454 in liver T-IC expansion and sorafenib response.
