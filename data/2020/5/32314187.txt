Cisplatin (CDDP) is a potent chemotherapeutic drug, but its severe side-effects often prohibit its use. Combined treatment with CDDP plus Farnesol (FAR) and their co-encapsulated nano form were investigated in in vitro to examine if synergistic cytotoxicity of this combination could reduce unwanted side-effects of CDDP chemotherapy and potentiate CDDP anticancer activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. After finding combination therapy of CDDP and FAR successfully combat HCC we formulated co-encapsulation of CDDP and FAR within poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) copolymer (NCDDPFAR) by following the standardized solvent displacement method. NCDDPFAR treatment caused faster drug mobility, sustained particle release, site-specific action and higher percentage of apoptotic death compared with single drug treatment even at relatively low concentrations. Co-encapsulation of two drugs exhibited additive effects against HCC; FAR reduced CDDP-induced glutathione level by increasing expression of CYP2E1 while CDDP directly interacted with DNA; FAR up-regulated the expression of TopII, thereby promoting DNA breaks and escaping DNA repair machinery. Expression pattern of apoptotic genes like p53, Bax, cytochrome c and caspase-3 suggested that NCDDPFAR induced HCC cell death through mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. Administration of NCDDPFAR had better ability of drug carriage and enhanced anticancer potentials against HCC cells.
