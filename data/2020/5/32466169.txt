Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer worldwide. Regorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor and the second-line treatment for HCC. Since the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is dysregulated in HCC, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of regorafenib combined with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 in the human HCC cell lines (n = 3). The combined treatment with BEZ235 and regorafenib enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation and increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in HCC cells. Moreover, the combined treatment suppressed HCC cell migration and invasion in the transwell assay. Further, the Western blot analyses confirmed the involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes such as slug, vimentin, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9/-2. Additionally, the proteinase activity of MMP-9/-2 was analyzed using gelatin zymography. Furthermore, the inhibition of phosphorylation of the Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1 after combined treatment was validated using Western blot analysis. Therefore, these results suggest that the combined treatment with BEZ235 and regorafenib benefits patients with HCC.
