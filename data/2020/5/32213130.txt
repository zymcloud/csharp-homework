Objective: To summarize and analyze the technique and experience of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) in children. Methods: From Dec 2015 to Dec 2018, surgical outcomes were evaluated in 30 pediatric patients with liver tumors. LLR was performed in 21 patients, including 15 males and 6 females with a mean age of 7.6 ± 3.8 years (range, 2-13 years) and a mean liver tumor diameter of 7.2 ± 2.0 cm (range, 4-10 cm). During the same period, 9 cases of traditional open liver resection were selected as controls, including 6 males and 3 females with a mean age of 7.0 ± 3.7 years (range, 2-13 years) and a mean liver tumor diameter of 7.5 ± 2.2 cm (range, 4.4-10.0 cm). Results: The mean operation time and mean hepatic inflow occlusion time were longer in the laparoscopic group, with values of 182.3 ± 66.1 minutes and 83.2 ± 38.2 minutes, respectively, than in the open group, with values of 120.0 ± 54.3 minutes and 49.6 ± 26.5 minutes, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups in blood loss (164.4 ± 107.4 mL versus 133.8 ± 87.1 mL), blood transfusion volume (102.2 ± 100.2 mL versus 69.2 ± 81.8 mL), and alanine aminotransferase levels 24 hours after surgery (212.0 ± 101.4 IU/L versus 173.3 ± 97.2 IU/L) and 72 hours after surgery (74.0 ± 32.5 IU/L versus 81.7 ± 57.3 IU/L). The average hospital stay in the laparoscopic group (6.2 ± 1.6 days) was significantly shorter than that in the open group (8.2 ± 2.0 days). The children in both groups recovered well after surgery without serious complications. Conclusion: LLR contributes to improved recovery of patients after surgery without increasing the incidence of complication, therefore, LLR is a safe option for liver tumors in children.
