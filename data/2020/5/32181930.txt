Background:Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor commonly used for prophylaxis of rejection in renal and liver transplantation. There are limited but favourable data regarding its possible use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Aims:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in patients with IBD in clinical practice.Methods:We performed a retrospective, multicentre study in 22 centres in Spain. All adult patients who received oral tacrolimus for luminal or perianal IBD were included. Clinical response was assessed by Harvey-Bradshaw index and partial Mayo score after 3 months. Perianal disease was evaluated by fistula drainage assessment.Results:One hundred and forty-three patients were included (mean age 38 years; 51% male; median disease duration 110 months). In ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 58), the partial Mayo score decreased after 3 months from median 6 to 3 (P = 0.0001), whereas in Crohn's disease (CD) (n = 85), the Harvey-Bradshaw index decreased after 3 months from median 9 to 7 (P = 0.011). In CD patients, blood tacrolimus concentrations during induction (>10 ng/mL vs <10 ng/mL; odds ratio 0.23, 95% CI 0.05-0.87) and the concomitant use of thiopurines (odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.81) were associated with lower clinical disease activity at 3 months. Of 62 patients with perianal disease, complete closure was observed in 8% (n = 5) of patients with perianal fistulas, with 34% (n = 21) showing partial response. Treatment was maintained for a median of 6 months (IQR, 2-16). After a median clinical follow-up of 24 months (IQR, 15-57), the rate of treatment-related adverse events was 34%, correlating with blood drug concentrations (P = 0.021). Finally, 120 patients (84%) discontinued tacrolimus, usually due to absence or loss of response. Three patients (2%) were subsequently diagnosed with cancer. The overall rate of surgery was 39%, with a 33% colectomy rate in UC.Conclusions:Tacrolimus shows a clinical benefit in both CD and UC after 3 months of treatment, but its long-term effectiveness and frequent adverse events remain relevant issues in clinical practice.
