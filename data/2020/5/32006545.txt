Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading etiology for chronic liver disease with an immense public health impact and affects >25% of the US and global population. Up to 1 in 4 NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent data confirm that HCC represents the fifth most common cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and NAFLD has been identified as a rapidly emerging risk factor for this malignancy. NAFLD-associated liver complications are projected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the next decade. Despite evidence that NAFLD-associated HCC may arise in the absence of cirrhosis, is often diagnosed at advanced stages, and is associated with lower receipt of curative therapy and with poorer survival, current society guidelines provide limited guidance/recommendations addressing HCC surveillance in patients with NAFLD outside the context of established cirrhosis. Limited data are presently available to guide clinicians with respect to which patients with NAFLD should undergo HCC surveillance, optimal screening tools, frequency of monitoring, and the influence of coexisting host- and disease-related risk factors. Herein we present an evidence-based review addressing HCC risk in patients with NAFLD and provide Best Practice Advice statements to address key issues in clinical management.
