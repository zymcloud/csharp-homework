Elbasvir/grazoprevir with or without ribavirin has excellent efficacy and safety for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and 4 patients. The real-world experience has been reported but the detailed analysis of liver and renal adverse effects is lacking. This study evaluated the real-world experience relating to the effectiveness and liver/renal safety of elbasvir/grazoprevir in HCV genotype 1 patients with compensated liver disease. In the four medical centres of Chang Gung Medical System, 350 HCV genotype 1 patients with compensated liver disease who were treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir were enrolled. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected. The effectiveness (sustained virologic response 12 weeks after end of treatment, SVR12) and safety were assessed. A consecutive series of 350 patients with a mean age of 68.8 ± 10.0 years old were enrolled. The majority were treatment-naïve (72.3%), genotype 1b (97.7%) and advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis (94.3%). Seventy-nine (22.6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma and 23 (6.6%) had coinfection with hepatitis B. The effectiveness of SVR12 was 94.6% (95% CI: 92.2%-97.0%) in the full analysis set and 99.1% (95% CI: 98.1%-100.1%) in the per-protocol set. There were two relapses and one nonresponder. Seven (2.0%) patients had adverse events resulting in premature discontinuation of treatment. Five of them were considered drug-related. One was due to autoimmune hepatitis. Contrary to previous reports, around 49% of ALT elevation was observed after 8 weeks, and in two patients was due to hepatitis B flares. As to the renal function during the course of therapy, a minor deterioration of eGFR was observed in patients with baseline eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 , but not in those with baseline eGFR <60, <60-30 or <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 . In this real-world data, elbasvir/grazoprevir was effective with few liver/renal adverse effects. One patient developed autoimmune hepatitis.
