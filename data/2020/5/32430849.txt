Background:The Fontan procedure has been widely accepted for children with single ventricle physiology and guarantees survival rates of approximately 80% at age 20 years. However, there have been cases of Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) caused due to congestion, along with recent reports of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in younger patients with FALD. The literature consists of only five previous case reports of patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC due to poorer cardiac function and liver cirrhosis caused due to congestion.Case presentation:The patient was a 37-year-old woman who presented with epigastralgia. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a liver tumor, 8 cm in diameter, in the caudate lobe. Liver damage was A, with an indocyanine green retention rate of 6% at 15 min. The levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K antagonists-II (PIVKA-II) were elevated to 81,663 ng/ml (normal Conclusions:First left hepatectomy with caudate lobectomy during reverse Trendelenburg position which reduced the CVP was performed in a patient with HCC and FALD.
Central venous pressure; Fontan-associated congestive liver cirrhosis; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Reverse Trendelenburg position; Surgical resection.
