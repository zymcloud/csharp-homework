Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5) could regulate cancer cell proliferation; however, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the function of ACP5 in HCC and examined the underlying molecular mechanisms. The expression of ACP5 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in a series of HCC tissues. The effects of ACP5 silencing on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of HCC were assessed in vitro by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, clonogenic assays, flow cytometry, and transwell assays. The results find that ACP5 is overexpressed in HCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Knockdown of ACP5 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cell lines. Furthermore, silencing of ACP5 induces cell cycle G2/M phase arrest and increases apoptosis of HCC cell lines. ACP5 provides potential novel targets for the treatment of HCC.
