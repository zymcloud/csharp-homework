Background:The influence of perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) on postsurgical survival of patients with different stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well clarified. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of PBT on survival outcomes of different stage of HCC patients.Methods:Consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for HCC between January 2009 and November 2015 were identified from an HCC prospective database in authors' center. The survival outcomes were compared between patients receiving PBT and those without PBT before and after propensity score matching (PSM) in different stage subsets. Cox regression analysis was performed to verify the impact of PBT on outcomes of HCC.Results:Among 1255 patients included, 804 (64.1%) were Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0-A, and 347 (27.6%) received PBT. Before PSM, patients with PBT had worse disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with those without PBT in both BCLC 0-A subset and BCLC B-C subset (all P Conclusions:PBT negatively influenced oncologic outcomes of patient with BCLC stage 0-A HCC, but not those with stage B-C after curative resection.
