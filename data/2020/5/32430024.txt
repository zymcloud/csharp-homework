Background:ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 8 (ABCA8) belongs to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. ABCA8 is a transmembrane transporter responsible for the transport of organics, such as cholesterol, and drug efflux. Some members of the ABC subfamily, such as ABCA1, may inhibit cancer development. However, the mechanism of ABCA8 in the process of cancer activation is still ambiguous.Methods:The expression of ABCA8 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines was examined using qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemical staining. The effects of ABCA8 on the proliferation and metastasis of HCC were examined using in vitro and in vivo functional tests. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to explore the binding between microRNA-374b-5p (miR-374b-5p) and the ABCA8 3'-untranslated region (UTR).Results:ABCA8 was frequently down-regulated in HCC and this down-regulation was negatively correlated with prognosis. The overexpression of ABCA8 inhibited growth and metastasis in HCC, whereas the knockdown of ABCA8 exerted the antithetical effects both in vivo and in vitro. ABCA8 was down-regulated by miR-374b-5p; this down-regulation can induce epithelial transformation to mesenchyme via the ERK/ZEB1 signaling pathway and promote HCC progression.Conclusion:We exposed the prognostic value of ABCA8 in HCC, and illuminated a novel pathway in ABCA8-regulated inhibition of HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis. These findings may lead to a new targeted therapy for HCC through the regulation of ABCA8, and miR-374b-5p.
