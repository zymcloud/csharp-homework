Aim: This study examined nanoparticle entry into tumor-associated vascular endothelial cells during transport to hepatocellular carcinoma cells and tumors. Materials & methods: siVEGF was loaded into CS-SS-9R/BSA-cRGD nanoparticles (CBc NPs). The intracellular uptake, gene silencing efficiency, antiproliferation and antiangiogenic effect of the NPs were performed on EA.hy926 cells. In vivo antitumor and antiangiogenic effects were investigated in Bel-7402 tumor-bearing nude mice. Results: siVEGF-loaded CBc NPs entered EA.hy926 cells and suppressed their proliferation and capillary formation. The NPs also inhibited tumor proliferation and angiogenesis in tumor-bearing mice, which attributed to the downregulation of VEGF mRNA expression in tumor tissue. Conclusion: The uptake of siVEGF-loaded CBc NPs by tumor-associated vascular endothelial cells made important contributions in controlling the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.
