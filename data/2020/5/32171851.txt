Alcoholism synergizes the development of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients infected with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV). Tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TICs) are refractory to therapy and have expression of stemness transcription factors. Leaky-gut-derived endotoxin stimulates TLR4-NANOG pathway that skews asymmetric cell division and that metabolically reprograms hepatocytes/liver progenitor cells, leading to self-renewal. TICs isolated from mouse HCC models or human HCCs are tumorigenic and have p53 degradation via phosphorylation of the protective protein NUMB and its dissociation from p53 by the oncofetal protein TBC1D15. Furthermore, dysregulation of lncRNA promotes genesis of TICs, leading to HCC development. This review describes roles of cell fate decision, metabolic reprogramming and lncRNA for TIC genesis and liver oncogenesis.
