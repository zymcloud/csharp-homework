Purpose of review:This review will describe the natural history of alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD) in light of recent data that have synthesized existing knowledge on this topic and described new research cohorts to improve our understanding of progression and outcomes in ArLD.Recent findings:ArLD occurs after a threshold of alcohol consumption, but this threshold is lowered by the presence of comorbid factors of which obesity is the most common. The most common stage of ArLD is alcohol-related steatosis: this is associated with a low rate of progression to cirrhosis (3%/year) and nonliver-related morbidity is more likely (4 versus 1%/year). In contrast, alcohol-related steatohepatitis or cirrhosis is more dangerous with higher rates of both nonliver and liver-related mortality. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs at approximately 3%/year amongst people with ArLD cirrhosis.Summary:These data allow an understanding of ArLD to accurately counsel patients and also to guide public health policies. Awareness of the shortcomings of the available data, highlighted in a recent systematic review, will inform the design of further research in particular to describe the multiple interacting factors that may cause ArLD to regress or progress.
