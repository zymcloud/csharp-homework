Background:Postoperative oral antiviral treatment with nucleoside or nucleotide analogues can suppress viral replication and reduce tumour recurrence for patients with hepatitis b virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-related HCC) after curative resection. However, the superior antiviral treatment is still unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the different effects of nucleotide and nucleoside analogues on the prognosis of HBV-related HCC after curative resection.Methods:From February 2007 to February 2016, 487 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed HCC according to the Milan criteria who underwent R0 resection were enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. According to their postoperative antiviral treatment, they were divided into the nucleotide group (NtA, n = 111) and the nucleoside group (NsA, n = 376).Results:The baseline characteristics, serologic parameters, tumour characteristics, and operative data of the 2 groups were comparable. Nucleotide analogue use significantly decreased HCC recurrence (P = 0.028) and HCC-related death (P = 0.004), with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.685 (95% CI, 0.484 to 0.971, P = 0.033) and 0.507 (95% CI, 0.310 to 0.830, P = 0.004), respectively, in multivariate Cox analyses. After the study patients were stratified according to three variables, we found that nucleotide analogue use was significantly associated with increased disease-free and overall survival among patients with cirrhosis, HBeAg-negative patients, and patients with positive HBV-DNA.Conclusions:In patients with HBV-related HCC, nucleotide analogues but not nucleoside analogues significantly reduced HCC recurrence and improved overall survival after R0 hepatic resection.
