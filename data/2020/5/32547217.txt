Background:Prophylactic transarterial chemoembolization (p-TACE) is strongly recommended for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with microvascular invasion (MVI), but the potential beneficiaries remain controversial.Methods:Data of HCC patients with MVI who underwent R0 resection between December 2013 and December 2015 were identified through the primary liver cancer big data. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients who received p-TACE or not using Kaplanï»¿-Meier survival curves before and after propensity scoring match (PSM).Results:A total of 695 patients were eligible for this study, including 199 patients (28.6%) receiving p-TACE and 496 patients (71.4%) receiving resection alone. In the crude cohort, median DFS and OS were longer in the p-TACE group than those in the non-TACE group without significant differences (25.0 months vs 24.2 months, P=0.100; 48.0 months vs 46.5 months, P=0.150; respectively), but significant differences were observed both in DFS and OS (both PConclusion:With the current data, we concluded that not all HCC patients with MVI would be benefited from p-TACE, and p-TACE could benefit patients with "middle risk" according to the current staging systems.
