Background:End-of-life intensive care may be futile and can be a cause of distress to both patients and their families. This study aimed to understand the utilization of intensive care and its associated factors in patients with End-stage liver disease (ESLD) during terminal hospitalization.Methods:Population-based retrospective cohort study using the National Health Institute Research Database of Taiwan. All adult patients with ESLD who died during their hospitalization in 2010-2013 were included.Findings:Of the 14,247 patients with ESLD, the majority (60·8%) was comorbid with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with ESLD only were younger, more deprived, more alcohol-related, and less likely to receive palliative care prior to terminal hospitalization (6·0% vs 29·2% with HCC). Compared to patients with comorbid HCC, relatively more patients without HCC were admitted to ICU (59·6% vs 22·3%), receiving CPR (11·1% vs 4·3%) and mechanical ventilation (36·3% vs 12·5%) during terminal hospitalization. Etiology of alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, septicemia, pneumonia and respiratory failure, and renal failure were associated with a higher probability of ICU admission (adjusted rate ratio (aRR) range: 1·09-2·09). Prior palliative care was associated with lower probability of ICU admission (aRR range: 0·24-0·38).Interpretation:The intensive care utilization by patients with ESLD in their terminal hospitalization was substantial in Taiwan. Those who are not comorbid with HCC need more attention, especially in terms of their palliative care needs, choices regarding intensive care, and their healthcare utilization.Funding:National Institute of Health Research Health Applied Research Collaboration (ARC) South London.
