Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive and widespread cancer. Patients with liver cirrhosis of different aetiologies are at a risk to develop HCC. It is important to know that in approximately 20% of cases primary liver tumors arise in a non-cirrhotic liver. Lipid metabolism is variable in patients with chronic liver diseases, and lipid metabolites involved therein do play a role in the development of HCC. Of note, lipid composition of carcinogenic tissues differs from non-affected liver tissues. High cholesterol and low ceramide levels in the tumors protect the cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis, and do also promote cell proliferation. So far, detailed characterization of the mechanisms by which lipids enable the development of HCC has received little attention. Evaluation of the complex roles of lipids in HCC is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of HCC, the later being of paramount importance for the development of urgently needed therapeutic interventions. Disturbed hepatic lipid homeostasis has systemic consequences and lipid species may emerge as promising biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The challenge is to distinguish lipids specifically related to HCC from changes simply related to the underlying liver disease. This review article discusses aberrant lipid metabolism in patients with HCC.
