Background and aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate whether presence of varices on computed tomography (CT) could predict treatment outcome for hepatocellular carcinoma patients.Methods:We enrolled 241 patients with single hepatocellular carcinoma â‰¤ 5 cm treated by surgery. With the use of preoperative CT/endoscopy, patients were classified into the following: presence of standard clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) surrogate, defined as varices on esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or thrombocytopenia with splenomegaly (group 1, n = 47); varices on CT without standard CSPH surrogate (group 2, n = 45); and none of both (group 3, n = 149). Development of posthepatectomy liver failure and overall survival (OS) were evaluated for each patient group, and patients were re-classified into two groups according to presence of CT-enhanced CSPH surrogate, defined as standard surrogate and/or varices on CT. Predictive power of each survival model was compared using Harrell's C-index.Results:Posthepatectomy liver failure rate in group 2 was similar to that in group 1 (53.3% [24/45] vs. 55.3% [26/47]; P = 1.000) but significantly higher than that in group 3 (53.3% [24/45] vs. 28.2% [42/149], P = 0.002). Seven-year OS rates in group 2 were similar to those in group 1 (55.6% vs. 60.8%, P = 0.988) but significantly lower than those in group 3 (55.6% vs. 83.3%, P = 0.001). Presence of standard CSPH surrogate (hazard ratio = 1.89 [1.08-3.30], P = 0.025) and CT-enhanced CSPH surrogate (hazard ratio = 2.60 [1.56-4.39], P Conclusion:The presence of CT-enhanced CSPH surrogate including varices on CT was the significant predictive of poor OS, providing better predictive power than standard surrogate.
