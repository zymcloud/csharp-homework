Splicing factor SRSF2 is frequently mutated or up-regulated in human cancers. Here, we observe that hepatocyte-specific deletion of Srsf2 trigger development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mice, which also involves inflammation and fibrosis. Importantly, we find that, when compensatory hepatocyte proliferation is impaired, activation of hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) play an important role in liver regeneration and tumor formation. Moreover, the cells of HCC- bearing livers display both HPC and hepatocyte markers, with gene expression profiling suggesting HPC origin and embryonic origin. Mechanically, we demonstrate that levels of oncofetal genes insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) and H19 are significantly increased in the tumors, likely due to decreased DNA methylation of the Igf2/H19 locus. Consequently, signaling via the Igf2 pathway is highly activated in the tumors. Thus, our data demonstrate that loss of Srsf2 triggers HPC-mediated regeneration and activation of oncofetal genes, which altogether promote HCC development and progression in mice.
