: Introduction: Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been correlated to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development and progression. We investigated, in a clinical model, the effects of the administration of 303 mg of silybin phospholipids complex, 10 g of vitamin D, and 15 mg of vitamin E (RealSIL, 100D, IBI-Lorenzini, Aprilia, Italy) in male NAFLD patients exposed to BPA on metabolic, hormonal, and oxidative stress-related parameters.Methods:We enrolled 32 male patients with histologic diagnosis of NAFLD and treated them with Realsil 100D twice a day for six months. We performed at baseline clinical, biochemical, and food consumption assessments as well as the evaluation of physical exercise, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), plasmatic and urinary BPA and estrogen levels. The results obtained were compared with those of healthy control subjects and, in the NAFLD group, between baseline and the end of treatment.Results:A direct proportionality between TBARS levels and BPA exposure was shown (p < 0.0001). The therapy determined a reduction of TBARS levels (p = 0.011), an improvement of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, insulinemia, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance, C reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha (p < 0.05), an increase of conjugated BPA urine amount, and a reduction of its free form (p < 0.0001; p = 0.0002). Moreover, the therapy caused an increase of plasmatic levels of the native form of estrogens (p = 0.03).Conclusions:We highlighted the potential role of BPA in estrogen oxidation and oxidative stress in NAFLD patients. The use of Realsil 100D could contribute to fast BPA detoxification and to improve cellular antioxidant power, defending the integrity of biological estrogen-dependent pathways.
