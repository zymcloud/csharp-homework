Background & aims:PAGE-B and modified PAGE-B (mPAGE-B) scores were developed to predict the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients on nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy. However, how and when to use these risk scores in clinical practice is uncertain.Methods:Consecutive adult patients with chronic hepatitis B who had received entecavir or tenofovir for at least 6 months between January 2005 and June 2018 were identified from a territory-wide database in Hong Kong. The performance of PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores for HCC prediction at 5 years was assessed by area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and different cut-off values of these 2 scores were evaluated by survival analysis.Results:Of 32,150 identified patients with chronic hepatitis B, 20,868 (64.9%) were male. Their mean age was 53.0 Â± 13.2 years. At a median (IQR) follow-up of 3.9 (1.8-5.0) years, 1,532 (4.8%) patients developed HCC. The AUROCs (95% CI) for the prediction of HCC at 5 years were 0.77 (0.76-0.78) and 0.80 (0.79-0.81), with PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores, respectively (p Conclusions:PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores can be applied to identify patients on antiviral therapy who are at low risk of developing HCC. These patients could be exempted from HCC surveillance due to their very low HCC risk.Lay summary:Risk scores have been developed to predict the likelihood of patients with chronic hepatitis B developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the role of 2 such scores, PAGE-B and modified PAGE-B, in predicting the risk of HCC in 32,150 nucleos(t)ide analogue-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B. These scores identified a group of patients at very low risk of developing HCC who could therefore be exempted from HCC surveillance.
