The recently approved direct-acting antivirals (DAA) agents are effective in terms of sustained virologic response (SVR) rates and are well tolerated in most hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. This study aimed to analyze the association between serum zinc levels in patients who developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following HCV eradication after DAA treatment. The retrospective study included 769 HCV-infected patients who achieved SVR after DAA treatment. We calculated the annual incidence rate of HCC and identified risk factors associated with HCC development. We also assessed serum zinc and clinical factors at both baseline and end of treatment (EOT). During follow-up (median duration 35 months), HCC occurred in 18/769 (2.3%) patients. From the multivariate analysis, serum zinc
