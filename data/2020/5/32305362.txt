Ascites constitutes the most frequent decompensating event in patients with advanced liver cancer and is associated with poor quality of life and high mortality. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy appears to be a reliable treatment strategy for advanced liver cancer ascites. However, the rapid metabolism of drugs and ascites dilution limits the efficacy of chemotherapeutics. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a novel thermosensitive hydrogel drug system for targeted therapy of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ascites through intraperitoneal administration. The system was prepared by blending resveratrol (RES) microspheres and cisplatin (DDP) into thermosensitive Pluronic F127 hydrogel. The in vitro anti-tumor activity against H22 cells indicated that the prepared drug system could initiate apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The mice model of ascites with advanced HCC was established to validate the therapeutic potential of the F127 hydrogel drug system in vivo. The results revealed that intraperitoneal administration of F127 hydrogel drug could significantly inhibit the number of ascites, the proliferation of tumor cells, micro-angiogenesis, and prolong the survival of mice, thus, augmenting the efficacy of intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining revealed that the F127 hydrogel drug system was safe and presented low toxicity to major vital organs. Collectively, this study highlights the clinical application potential of the F127 hydrogel drug delivery system.
