Background:Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is conventionally considered a rare benign liver tumor, but advanced studies have revealed that HCA is heterogeneous, and may include a type that is prone to malignant transformations. Differentiation between well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia is necessary to diagnose hepatocellular adenoma through imaging; however, the tumor marker of hepatocellular carcinoma, protein induced by vitamin K absence, or antagonist II (PIVKA-II), is rarely positive in hepatocellular adenoma.Case presentation:A 44-year-old woman presented to our hospital with complaints of loss of appetite and weight loss. Multidetector row computed tomography revealed a liver tumor (diameter, 80 mm) that was enhanced in the arterial phase. Her serum PIVKA-II level was very high (3327 mAU/mL). Based on the enlargement of the mass and the results of the diagnostic imaging, hepatocellular adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma was suspected, and we considered the possibility of a malignant transformation due to the high level of serum PIVKA-II; thus, we performed hepatectomy. Histological examination showed brown pigment deposition in the hepatocytes, which was determined to be lipofuscin granules. Based on immunohistochemical findings, the diagnosis was unclassified hepatocellular adenoma. Immunohistochemical examinations revealed that the adenoma cells in the tumor were positive for PIVKA-II. Her serum PIVKA-II level returned to normal after the resection.Conclusions:We present a case of unclassified hepatocellular adenoma with brown pigment deposition and elevation of serum PIVKA-II level. For the differentiation of liver tumors with high levels of PIVKA-II and hypervascular mass, hepatocellular adenoma should be considered.
