Background and aim:This study aimed to assess the potential relationship between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and the recurrence risk of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) after curative resection and tried to develop a reliable TMB based nomogram.Methods:This retrospective study was conducted in 128 patients (40 patients suffered from a recurrence of HCC) who had received radical hepatectomy by the same surgical team. A nomogram model was constructed using the R and EmpowerStats software.Results:TMB was not associated with maximum tumor size and the presence of microvascular invasion (MVI). In the whole population or subgroups, the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was significantly lower in the TMB high group. In multivariate analysis, TMB (hazard ratio [HR], 10.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.03-20.31; P Conclusion:This study demonstrated for the first time that higher TMB was associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC who had received curative resection, and a TMB based nomogram model had a well predictive performance for RFS in this population.
