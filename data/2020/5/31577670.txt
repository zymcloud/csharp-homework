Background:The effect of height and sex on liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.Methods:Using United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data, 14 844 HCC patients listed for LT from 2005 to 2015 were identified. Cumulative incidence of waitlist events (LT and dropout for death or too sick) were calculated and modeled using Fine and Gray competing risk regression.Results:Short (SWR), mid (MWR), and long (LWR) UNOS wait regions comprised 25%, 42%, and 33% of the cohort. Three-year cumulative incidence of LT was lower in shorter height patients (â‰¤150, 151-165, and >185 cm; 70.8%, 76.7%, and 83.5%; P 185 cm) was associated with lower probability of LT (0.81 and 0.89; P = 0.02) and greater dropout (HR 1.99 and 1.43; P Conclusions:Despite uniform HCC Model for End-Stage Liver Disease exception across height and sex, shorter patients and females in MWR have lower probability of LT. Consideration should be given to awarding additional Model for End-Stage Liver Disease exception points to these patients.
