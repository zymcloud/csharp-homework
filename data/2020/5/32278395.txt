Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic disorder progressing from an initial benign accumulation of fat (NAFL) towards steatohepatitis (NASH), a degenerative form that can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. The development of non-invasive, rapid and accurate method to diagnose NASH is of high clinical relevance. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of plasma was tested as a method to distinguish NAFL from NASH. SERS spectra from plasma of female patients diagnosed with NAFL (n = 32) and NASH (n = 35) were obtained in few seconds, using a portable Raman spectrometer. The sample consisted of 5 Î¼L of biofluid deposited on paper coated with Ag nanoparticles. The spectra show consistent differences between the NAFL and NASH patients, with the uric acid/hypoxanthine band area ratio statistically different (p-value <0.001) between the two groups. The average figures of merit for a diagnostic test based on these ratios, as derived from a repeated 4-fold cross-validation of a logistic regression model, are all between 0.73 and 0.79, with an average area under the curve of 0.81. We conclude that SERS may be a reliable and rapid method to discriminate NAFLD from NASH.
