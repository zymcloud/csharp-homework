Background:Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) remains the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with countries in Asia being affected the most. The mainstay of curative therapy for early HCC is radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or surgery; either surgical resection (SR) or liver transplantation. Latest evidence however suggests that combination of TACE+ RFA may provide outcomes comparable to SR.Aim:To compare oncologic outcomes and safety profile of TACE + RFA to SR alone in HCC.Materials and methods:A systematic review was conducted through Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for literature published before April 2019. Outcomes measured were disease-free survival(DFS), overall survival(OS) and major complications. DFS was further divided into local tumour progression(LTP), intrahepatic distant recurrence(IDR) and distant metastasis(DM).Results:Eight retrospective studies and one randomized controlled trial, involving 1892 patients met eligibility criteria and were included. Unadjusted pooled analysis demonstrated no significant difference in 1-year, 3-year and 5-year OS and 1-year DFS between TACE+RFA and SR. SR had superior 3-year DFS (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98, p = 0.03) and 5-year DFS (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.95, p = 0.02) compared to TACE+RFA. When analysing only the propensity matched data, the difference in 3-year DFS and 5-year DFS was not significant. TACE+RFA had a higher LTP rate (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.05-5.86, p = 0.04) compared to SR but IDR and DM rates were not significant.Discussion and conclusion:TACE+RFA offer comparable oncologic outcomes in patients with HCC as compared with SR and with added benefit of lower morbidity.
