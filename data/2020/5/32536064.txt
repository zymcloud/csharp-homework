The structure and performance of nuclear cytoplasmic autophagosomes was explored. Seventeen cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cells with other diseases from liver tissues were selected. The nuclear cytoplasm were isolated and degraded by the nuclear membrane. Damaged cytoplasm had damaged its own membrane and the surrounding nuclear tissues other than the nuclear membrane, leading to specific nucleolysis and cell death of liver cancer cells and liver cells.
Carcinoma, hepatocellular; Cell death; Hepatocytes; Specific nucleolysis.
