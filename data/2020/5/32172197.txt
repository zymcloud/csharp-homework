Purpose:We investigated the activities of an ImmunoTOX board, an academic, multidisciplinary group of oncologists and organ specialists that adopts a real-life, case-by-case approach in the management of patients with immune-related adverse events (irAEs).Experimental design:The ImmunoTOX assessment board was set up in 2016 at Gustave Roussy in France. It meets every 2 weeks to discuss the case-by-case management of patients presenting with irAEs. Here, we describe the ImmunoTOX board's activities between 2016 and 2019.Results:Over study period, 398 requests (concerning 356 patients) were submitted to the ImmunoTOX board. Most of the requests concerned the putative causal link between immunotherapy and the irAE (n = 148, 37%), followed by possible retreatment after temporary withdrawal because of an adverse event (n = 109, 27%), the clinical management of complex situations (n = 100, 25%) and the initiation of immunotherapy in patients with pre-existing comorbidities (n = 41, 10%). The ImmunoTOX board discerned 273 irAEs. The five organ systems most frequently involved by irAEs were lung (n = 58, 21%), gastrointestinal tract (n = 36, 13%), liver or biliary tract (n = 33, 12%), musculoskeletal system (n = 27, 10%), and nervous system (n = 23, 8%). The time to occurrence was shorter for severe irAEs (grade III and VI) than for mild irAEs (grades I and II), with medians of 47 and 91 days, respectively (p = 0.0216).Conclusion:The main medical needs in the management of irAEs involved the lung organ. Severe irAEs were expected to occur earlier than mild irAEs. This real-life study can help to better estimate medical needs and therefore help to assess the management of irAEs.
