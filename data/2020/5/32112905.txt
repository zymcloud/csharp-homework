Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, despite improvements in the clinical trial and diagnosis, HCC still remains high mortality due to the 70% recurrence and lung metastasis after surgical resection. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles, which are shuttled from donor cells to recipient cells, contributing to the recruitment and reprogramming of constituents via an autocrine or paracrine fashion. HCC derived exosomes could redirect metastasis of tumor cells which lack the capacity to metastasize to a specific organ via generating pre-metastatic niche. These findings emphasize a practical and potentially feasible role of exosomes in the treatment of patients with HCC, both as a target and a vehicle for drug design. We herein summarize recent findings that implicate oncogenes and non-canonical signaling of HCC exosomes, as well as the impact of exosomal bioactive molecules in high recurrence induced by organ-specific metastasis. The aim of review is to illustrate the underlying mechanism of exosomes in tumor metastasis, immune evasion, and the potential application of prognostic biomarker in HCC process.
