Introduction:Paragangliomas are rare endocrine tumors that arise from the extra-adrenal autonomic paraganglia and sympathetic paragangliomas usually secret catecholamines and are located in the sympathetic paravertebral ganglia of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. In contrast, most parasympathetic paragangliomas are nonfunctional and located along the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves in the neck and at the base of the skull. Such neoplasms, although rare, are clinically important because they may recur after surgical resection and 10% of them give rise to metastases causing death with the lymphatic nodes, bones, liver, and lungs being the most common locations.Case presentation:We present a case of a 26-year-old male patient that was diagnosed with paraganglioma of the right-frontal lobe infiltrating the falx and frontal bone which was diagnosed after suffering from a headache and abnormal vision. On initial work-up he was found to have right pulmonary nodules that increased in size after follow up and other nodules appeared in the contralateral lung. He underwent subtotal resection of the brain tumor and complete resection of the bilateral pulmonary nodules.Conclusion:To our knowledge, paraganglioma is considered to be a rare entity in the central nervous system with very few cases being reported in the supratentorial region and no cases were reported of metastatic such paraganglioma to the lung.
