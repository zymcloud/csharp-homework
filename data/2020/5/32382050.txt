The present study aimed to explore the value of intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). This study included 65 patients with malignant hepatic nodules (55 with HCC, 10 with ICC), and 17 control patients with normal livers. All patients underwent IVIM-DWI scans on a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The standard apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), pure diffusion coefficient (Dslow), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (Dfast), and perfusion fraction (f) were obtained. Differences in the parameters among the groups were analysed using one-way ANOVA, with p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to compare the efficacy of each parameter in differentiating HCC from ICC. ADC, Dslow, Dfast, f significantly differed among the three groups. ADC and Dslow were significantly lower in the HCC group than in the ICC group, while Dfast was significantly higher in the HCC group than in the ICC group; f did not significantly differ between the HCC and ICC groups. When the cut-off values of ADC, Dslow, and Dfast were 1.27 × 10-3 mm2/s, 0.81 × 10-3 mm2/s, and 26.04 × 10-3 mm2/s, respectively, their diagnostic sensitivities for differentiating HCC from ICC were 98.18%, 58.18%, and 94.55%, their diagnostic specificities were 50.00%, 80.00%, and 80.00%, and their areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were 0.687, 0.721, and 0.896, respectively. Dfast displayed the largest AUC value. IVIM-DWI can be used to differentiate HCC from ICC.
