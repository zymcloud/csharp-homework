Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. It most often develops in cirrhosis, the etiology varying based on regional risk factors. Multidisciplinary treatment is the cornerstone of the management of HCC, with surgical or local treatments available for early-stage disease. In advanced disease, there was no progress for many years, with sorafenib in the first-line, and, more recently, regorafenib in selected second-line patients. In the last 2 years, multiple treatment options have surfaced, making the therapeutic decisions both more promising and complex.
