Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are man-made chemicals that are used for the fabrication of many products with water- and dirt-repellent properties. The toxicological potential of both substances is currently under debate. In a recent Scientific Opinion, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has identified increased serum total cholesterol levels in humans as one major critical effect being associated with exposure to PFOA or PFOS. In animal studies, both substances induced a decrease of serum cholesterol levels, and the underlying molecular mechanism(s) for these opposed effects are unclear so far. In the present study, we examined the impact of PFOA and PFOS on cholesterol homoeostasis in the human HepaRG cell line as a model for human hepatocytes. Cholesterol levels in HepaRG cells were not affected by PFOA or PFOS, but both substances strongly decreased synthesis of a number of bile acids. The expression of numerous genes whose products are involved in synthesis, metabolism and transport of cholesterol and bile acids was strongly affected by PFOA and PFOS at concentrations above 10 ÂµM. Notably, both substances led to a strong decrease of CYP7A1, the key enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, both at the protein level and at the level of gene expression. Moreover, both substances led to a dilatation of bile canaliculi that are formed by differentiated HepaRG cells in vitro. Similar morphological changes are known to be induced by cholestatic agents in vivo. Thus, the strong impact of PFOA and PFOS on bile acid synthesis and bile canalicular morphology in our in vitro experiments may allow the notion that both substances have a cholestatic potential that is connected to the observed increased serum cholesterol levels in humans in epidemiological studies.
