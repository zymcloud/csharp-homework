Background:Single port laparoscopic hepatectomy has been applied in some surgeries. We aimed to describe our experience with single port laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (SPLS) and to compare the safety and feasibility of this technique with those of conventional multi-port laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (MPLS) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 72 consecutive patients who underwent SPLS (n = 33) and MPLS (n = 39) for HCC were enrolled. The peri-operative parameters of safety and feasibility, as well as the short-term oncological outcomes were compared.Results:The length of postoperative hospital stay (LOS) was significantly shorter in the SPLS group than in the MPLS group (4.12 vs. 4.59 days, P = 0.043). No significant difference between the two groups was found in the operation time (104.58 vs. 95.69 min in the SPLS group and MPLS group respectively, P = 0.353) or the amount of blood loss (62.73 vs. 68.46 ml, P = 0.595). The 1-year recurrence-free survival rate was 77.9% in the SPLS group and 70.7% in the MPLS group (P = 0.82). Subgroup analysis showed that for patients without cirrhosis, the LOS was shorter in the SPLS group than in the MPLS group (P = 0.033), while for patients with cirrhosis, the LOS was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.201), although it was shorter in the SPLS group.Conclusions:SPLS was a feasible and safe surgical approach for the treatment of HCC on left lateral section.
