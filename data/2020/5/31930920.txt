Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by liver steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular damage. NASH is a serious condition that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The association of NASH with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia has led to an emerging picture of NASH as the liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Although diet and exercise can dramatically improve NASH outcomes, significant lifestyle changes can be challenging to sustain. Pharmaceutical therapies could be an important addition to care, but currently none are approved for NASH. Here, we review the most promising targets for NASH treatment, along with the most advanced therapeutics in development. These include targets involved in metabolism (e.g., sugar, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism), inflammation, and fibrosis. Ultimately, combination therapies addressing multiple aspects of NASH pathogenesis are expected to provide benefit for patients.
