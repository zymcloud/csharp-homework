The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) on perioperative outcomes, with an emphasis on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and functional recovery.We compared the clinical outcomes in a cohort of 275 patients undergoing liver resection before and after the implementation of ERAS. The PROs were preoperatively and postoperatively compared until 14 days after surgery using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory.The patients in the ERAS group experienced fewer symptoms and a shorter functional recovery time than the patients in the non-ERAS group. The group Ã— time interactions were different between the groups for pain (F = 4.70, P = .001) and walking (F = 2.75, P = .03). On the 3rd, 4, and 5th days after surgery, the ERAS group experienced less pain and more walking than the non-ERAS group. The ERAS group experienced less fatigue (0.407 [95% confidence interval, CI: -0.795, -0.020], P = .035), less sleep interference (0.615 [95% CI: -1.215, -0.014], P = .045), a lower rate of reduced appetite (0.281 [95% CI: -0.442, -0.120], P = .001), and less abdominal distension (0.262 [95% CI: -0.504, -0.020], P = .034) than the non-ERAS group. Those in the ERAS group had a significantly shorter median time from surgery to mild fatigue (5.41 vs 6.87 days, P = .003), mild pain (4.45 vs 6.09 days, P = .001), mild interference when walking (3.85 vs 5.54 days, P
