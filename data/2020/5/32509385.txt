Cumulative evidence has indicated that mitochondrial respiration dysfunction plays important roles in tumorigenesis. However, the role of COX7RP, a critical regulator in the formation of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplex that has been suggested to be over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by our bioinformatic analysis of TCGA data, in tumor progression remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that COX7RP is frequently over-expressed in HCC mainly due to the down-regulation of miR-130a-3p and predicts poor prognosis of HCC patients. Functional experiments revealed that COX7RP promoted both growth and metastasis of HCC through induction of cell cycle progression and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and suppression of cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequently activated nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling was found to contribute to the promotion of HCC cell growth and metastasis by COX7RP. Collectively, COX7RP plays a critical oncogenic role in hepatocellular carcinogenesis, supporting COX7RP as a novel prognostic factor and therapeutic target in HCC.
