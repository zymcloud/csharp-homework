Purpose:H2A.Z is an oncogenic histone variant that is overexpressed in cancers. Two isoforms of H2A.Z, H2AFZ and H2AFV, are identical except for a three-amino acid difference. However, their isoform-specific functions remain unclear in cancer development. Thereby, this study aimed to investigate whether the two isoforms play distinct functions in hepatocarcinogenesis.Materials and methods:Expressions of H2A.Z isoforms in 116 paired hepatocellular cancerous and para-cancerous tissues were detected by employing qPCR. GEO and TCGA databases were used to probe expressions and prognostic value of the two H2A.Z isoforms. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted. Furthermore, co-expressed analysis of H2AFZ and H2AFV ﻿was performed by using cBioPortal database. H2A.Z binding genes from Chip-seq were intersected with H2A.Z isoforms co-expressed genes to perform functional annotations. Cell proliferation experiments from H2AFZ knockout HepG2 and BEL-7402 cells were implemented. Finally, RNA-seq was applied to analyse alternative splicing in H2AFZ knockout and wild-type cells.Results:H2AFZ and H2AFV were both significantly upregulated (P Conclusion:Both H2A.Z isoforms play vital and distinct roles in the occurrence and progression of liver cancer, which may pave a way for novel therapeutic applications for cancers in the future.
