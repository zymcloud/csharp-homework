Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary hepatic malignancy worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as effective markers for the detection of multiple cancers. This study aimed to illuminate the mechanism of ﻿prostate ﻿androgen ﻿regulated ﻿transcript 1 (PART1) in HCC.Materials and methods:The levels of PART1, miR-149-5p and ﻿mitogen-activated ﻿protein ﻿kinase 1 (MAP2K1) mRNA were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Cell proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was carried out to examine the relationship among PART1, miR-149-5p and MAP2K1. Western blot assay was conducted to measure the protein expression of MAP2K1.Results:PART1 and MAP2K1 expression were greatly increased and miR-149-5p level was decreased in HCC tissues. Functional analysis revealed that the si-PART1 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. PART1 directly bound to miR-149-5p and miR-149-5p level was down-regulated by PART1. Moreover, restoration experiment demonstrated that the effect of PART1 knockdown on HCC cell progression could be partially rescued by miR-149-5p depletion. MiR-149-5p was predicted to target MAP2K1 and MAP2K1 expression was negatively modulated by miR-149-5p. Also, MAP2K1 rescued the inhibitory effects of miR-149-5p overexpression on proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC cells. Besides, the inhibition of miR-149-5p weakened the impact on MAP2K1 expression mediated by PART1 repression.Conclusion:PART1 promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells by regulating miR-149-5p/MAP2K1 axis.
