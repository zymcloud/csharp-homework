Background:Identification of factors to detect and improve chemotherapy-response in cancer is a main concern. microRNA-372-3p (miR-372-3p) has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in cellular proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis of various cancers including Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). However, its contribution towards Doxorubicin (Dox) chemosensitivity in HCC has never been studied.Objective:This study aims to investigate the potential role of miR-372-3p in enhancing Dox effects on HCC cell line (HepG2). Their correlation has been additionally analyzed for HCC patients who received Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) with Dox treatment.Methods:Different cell processes were elucidated by cell viability, colony formation, apoptosis and wound healing assays after miR372-3p transfection in HepG2 cells Furthermore, miR-372-3p level has been estimated in blood of primary HCC patients treated with TACE/Dox by quantitative real-time PCR assay. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis for serum miR-372-3p was constructed for its prognostic significance. Finally, protein level of Mcl-1, the anti-apoptotic player, has been evaluated using western blot.Results:We found a significant higher level of miR-372-3p in blood of responder group of HCC patients received TACE with Dox than of non-responders. Ectopic expression of miR-372-3p reduced cell proliferation, migration and significantly induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells which was coupled with decreased of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1.Conclusion:Our study demonstrated that miR-372-3p acts as tumor suppressor in HCC and can act as a predictor biomarker for drug response. Furthermore, the data referred for the first time its potential role in drug sensitivity that might be a therapeutic target for HCC.
