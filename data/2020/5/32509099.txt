Although a previous study suggested that erythropoietin-producing hepatoma (EPH) receptors play important roles in tumor progression and the overexpression of EPHs in cancer patients is related to poor prognoses, high-throughput gene expression profiling of EPH family members in different types and subtypes of cancers has so far not been conducted. We herein carried out a series of bioinformatic analyses on expressive profiles of every EPH member across 21 different types of clinical cancers versus matched normal tissues gathered from the Oncomine platform. We validated these results by protein expression study of all EPHs family members by The Human Protein Atlas repository. Our results uncovered the overexpression of most EPH subunits in numerous cancer types, especially the dramatic overexpression of six EPHs members, namely EPHA1, EPHA2, EPHA3, EPHA4 and EPHB1, EPHB2, EPHB3, EPHB4 in bladder, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, EPHB2 was specifically highly expressed in cervical cancer, EPHA3 in liver cancer, and EPHB1 in uterine cancer. Collectively, expressive profiles of these EPHs were confirmed and correlated with different cancer subtypes as potential biomarkers. This study provides useful information for further studies on cancer development and clinical treatments.
