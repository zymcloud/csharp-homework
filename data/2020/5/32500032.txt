Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which act as initiators and promoters of various diseases, were thought to be mostly noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in eukaryotes, until recent studies confirmed that some circRNAs have the function of encoding proteins. Accumulating research findings have proved that dysregulation of circRNAs is associated with the developmental process of multiple cancers. circHIPK3, an example of circRNA, is frequently expressed in many diseases, such as diabetes, age-related cataract, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, preeclampsia, osteoblasts, and retinal vascular dysfunction, leading to disease development and progression. In addition, circHIPK3 may also serve as a potential biomarker, to help us know more about the rules of occurrence and development of cancers. In recent studies, many circHIPK3-related cancers have been identified, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, osteosarcoma, glioma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and chronic myeloid leukemia. This review summarizes recent studies on the biological mechanisms of circHIPK3 and expounds the molecular mechanisms of circHIPK3 in these malignant tumors.
