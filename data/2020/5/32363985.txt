A 60-year-old male patient presented with a serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) level of 2940.5 ng/mL accompanied by a significant increase in serum globulin. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was 2.85 × 103 (normal value <1.0 × 103). B-mode ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging showed characteristic manifestations and he was clinically diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in January 2015. He received radiofrequency ablation and tenofovir disoproxil anti-HBV therapy and his serum AFP and globulin levels were significantly reduced. In March 2018, he presented at our Hematology Department with fatigue and a pale complexion. At that time, his serum AFP level was normal, with hemoglobin 61 g/L and globulin 64.7 g/L. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) by bone marrow examination, and immunofixation electrophoresis. The patient received PCD chemotherapy (bortezomib 2.0 g/dL on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 plus cyclophosphamide 0.3 g/dL on days 1-4 plus dexamethasone 20 mg/dL on days 1-2, 4-5, 8-9, and 11-12). The patient finally died of MM complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation.
