Background/aims:The purpose of this study is to explore the expression characteristics of lncRNA NEAT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the molecular mechanism of its regulation on sorafenib resistance.Materials and methods:This experimental study was performed from June 2013 to June 2019. The level of NEAT1 was determined using RT-PCR in HCC and matched adjacent tissues from 79 HCC patients in Linyi central hospital. The patients were divided into two groups to compare their prognosis based on the median NEAT1 expressions as a cutoff value. HCC cell line HepG2 negative control (HepG2-NC), sorafenib-resistant HepG2 cells (HepG2-SR) were transfected with or without NEAT1 siRNA, followed by subsequent molecular analysis, to determine the function of NEAT1 on sorafenib resistance in HCC cells. The cell transcripts were determined by RNA-sequencing analysis. The binding site of the NEAT1 and microRNA-149-5p (miR-149-5p) was verified by luciferase assay.Results:We found that NEAT1 was significantly increased in HCC tissues. Furthermore, NEAT1 expressions were significantly associated with HCC prognosis and chemoresistance patterns against sorafenib. Subsequently, the sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines, together with the controls, were used to determine the regulatory effect of NEAT1 on HCC cells' progression and sorafenib resistance. NEAT1 targets the miR-149-5p, and therefore, decrease the activity of sorafenib against HCC cells. NEAT1 functions were demonstrated to be triggered by the regulation of miR-149-5p/AKT1 axis.Conclusions:NEAT1/miR-149-5p/AKT1 pathway-based therapy might be a potential clinical application for HCC patients.
