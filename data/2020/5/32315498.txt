Objective:Systemic therapy, such as sorafenib, has been used clinically to treat patients with advanced stage or Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system (BCLC) stage C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of combined sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in this group of patients.Methods:Data on patients with HCC at BCLC stage C from August 2012 to September 2017 were collected. Patients who were given sorafenib alone were classified as the monotherapy group and those taking sorafenib and TACE were classed as the combined therapy group.Results:A total of 118 patients were enrolled. There were 65 and 53 patients in the monotherapy and the combined therapy group, respectively. The groups' general characteristics were similar. Compared with the monotherapy group the combined therapy group experienced prolonged time-to-progression (TTP) (mean 6.42 mo vs 3.63 mo, P = 0.003) and overall survival (OS) (mean 11.21 mo vs 5.98 mo, P = 0.001). A subgroup analysis found that patients with macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI) also had prolonged TTP and OS in the combined therapy group than the monotherapy group (mean TTP, 7.93 mo vs 3.43 mo, P = 0.007; mean OS, 13.41 mo vs 5.50 mo, P = 0.001), however, these significant differences did not exist for those with extrahepatic spread (EHS).Conclusion:Combined sorafenib and TACE therapy has significant better outcomes than sorafenib alone in patients with stage C HCC, particularly those with MVI.
