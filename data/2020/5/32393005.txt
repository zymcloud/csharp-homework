Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of three-dimensional(3D) visualization technology in the precision diagnosis and treatment for primary liver cancer. Methods: A total of 1 665 patients with primary liver cancer who admitted to seven medical centers in China between January 2009 to January 2019, diagnosed and treated by 3D visualization protocol were analyzed, and their clinical data were retrospectively reviewed. There were 1 255 males(75.4%) and 410 females(24.6%), with age of (52.9±11.9) years (range: 18 to 86 years). The acquisition of high-quality CT images with submillimeter spatial resolution were conducted using a quality control system. By means of homogenization methods, 3D reconstruction and 3D visualization analysis were performed. Postoperative observation: pathology reports, microvascular invasion, perioperative complications and follow-up. SPSS 25.0 statistical software was used for statistical description and analysis of clinical data. Kaplan-Meier curve was used to calculate overall survival and disease-free survival rate. Results: (1)In the sample of 1 265 patients, 3D reconstructed models clearly displayed as follows. tumor size: ≤2 cm in 155 cases (9.31%), >2 cm to 5 cm in 551 cases (33.09%), >5 cm to 10 cm in 636 cases (38.20%), >10 cm in 323 cases (19.40%). (2) Classification of hepatic blood vessels. Hepatic artery: type Ⅰ(normal type) in 1 494 cases(89.73%),variant hepatic artery in 171 cases (10.27%), including type Ⅱ in 35 cases, type Ⅲ in 38 cases, and other types in 98 cases. Hepatic vein: type Ⅰ (normal) in 1 195 cases (71.77%),variant hepatic veins in 470 cases(28.23%), including type Ⅱ in 376 cases and type Ⅲ in 94 cases. Portal vein:normal type in 1 315 cases (78.98%), variant portal veins in 350 cases (21.02%), including type Ⅰ in 189 cases, type Ⅱin 103 cases, type Ⅲ in 50 cases, type Ⅳ in 8 cases. Hepatic artery variation coexisting with portal vein variation in 24 cases (1.44%). Hepatic vein variation coexisting with portal vein variation in 113 cases (6.79%). Three types of vascular variation in 4 cases (0.24%), including coexistence of type Ⅱ hepatic artery variation or type Ⅰ portal vein variation with type Ⅲ hepatic vein variation in 2 cases,coexistence of type Ⅲ hepatic artery variation or type Ⅲ portal vein variation with type Ⅱ hepatic vein variation in 2 cases. (3) Preoperative liver volume calculation:1 499.3 (514.4)ml (range:641.7 to 6 637.0 ml) of total liver volume, including 479.1 (460.1) ml (range:10.5 to 2 086.8 ml) for liver resection and 959.9 (460.4)ml (range:306.1 to 5 638.0 ml) for residual function. (4)Operative methods: anatomical hepatectomy in 1 458 cases (87.57%); non-anatomic hepatectomy in 207 cases (12.43%). (5)the median operation time was 285(165)minutes (range: 40 to720 minutes). (6)The median intraoperative blood loss was 200(250)ml (range:10 to 4 200 ml) and 346 cases (20.78%) had intraoperative transfusion. (7)Pathology reports: hepatocellular carcinoma in 1 371 cases (82.34%), cholangiocarcinoma in 260 cases (15.62%) and mixed hepatocellular carcinoma in 34 cases (2.04%). Microvascular invasion: M0 in 199 cases, M1 in 64 cases, and M2 in 27 cases. (8)Postoperative complications in 207 cases (12.43%), including Clavien-Dindo grade Ⅰ or Ⅱ in 57 cases, grade Ⅲ or Ⅳ in 147 cases and grade Ⅴ in 3 cases.There were 13 cases (0.78%) of liver failure and 3 cases (0.18%) of perioperative death. (9) The follow-up time was 3.0 to 96.0 months, with a median time of 21.0(17.8) years. The overall 3-year survival and disease-free survival rates were 80.0% and 56.5%, respectively. The overall 5-year survival and disease-free survival rates were 59.7% and 30.0%, respectively. Conclusion: 3D visualization technology plays an important role in realizing accurate diagnosis of anatomical location and morphology of primary liver cancer, improving the success rate of surgery and reducing the incidence of complications.
