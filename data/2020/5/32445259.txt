Background and aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant disease worldwide. It is implicated in high cancer-related mortality rates in humans. Î²-Arrestin1 (ARRB1) has been demonstrated to be related to the development of several cancers, while the relationship between ARRB1 and metastasis in HCC is unknown.Methods:A tissue microarray of 68 tissues from HCC patients with or without metastasis was collected. Wild-type and ARRB1 knockout mice were used to examine the role of ARRB1 in metastasis in vivo. The level of ARRB1 in HCC tissues, mouse liver tissues, and cell lines was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Migration, invasion, and motility capacities of HCC cells were determined by transwell assay and wound healing assay. Vein injection of nude mice model was used to reveal the metastatic abilities of HCC cell lines. For the mechanism study, we investigated the effects of ARRB1 on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in HCC.Results:We reveal that ARRB1 accelerates metastasis in HCC and that ARRB1 deficiency inhibits hepatocarcinogenesis and reverses EMT in mice. ARRB1 regulates HCC cell migration and invasion and suppresses HCC metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, we show that ARRB1 promotes EMT through the phosphorylation of ERK1/2.Conclusions:Our data suggest that ARRB1 promotes HCC invasion and metastasis through p-ERK1/2-mediated EMT and that suppression of ARRB1 or p-ERK1/2 may offer potential therapeutic targets for HCC therapy.
