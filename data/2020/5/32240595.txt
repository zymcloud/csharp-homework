Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor type which results in poor prognosis. ALBI and Child-Pugh score have been widely applied for predicting prognosis in patients with liver diseases. We conducted a systematic review to compare the prognostic ability of ALBI versus Child-Pugh in HCC patients.Areas covered:PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were explored. The data were extracted from every study. Studies investigating HCC patients and comparing the predicting ability between ALBI and Child-Pugh were analyzed.Expert opinion:This systematic review revealed that ALBI showed better discriminative ability than Child-Pugh for predicting the prognosis in HCC patients. However, the predictive abilities of two scores should be improved. Except for the most common used serum biomarker AFP for diagnosis and surveillance of HCC, recent studies have also explored all aspects of HCC through genome-wide sequencing, exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and genome-wide methylation analysis which provide essential clues for genotyping of HCC. Further studies should explore biomarkers by advanced techniques to validate new prognostic tools for early diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. Moreover, multicenter prospective studies should be carried out to compare the prognostic values of predictive indicators in HCC population in the future.
