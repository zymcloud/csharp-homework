The post-translational modifications of histones, including histone methylation and demethylation, control the expression switch of multiple genes. SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase 7 (SET7) is the only methyltransferase, which can specifically monomethylate lysine-4 of histone H3 (H3K4me1) and play critical roles in various diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis C virus (HCV), atherosclerotic vascular disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and obesity. However, several known SET7 inhibitors exhibit weak activity or poor selectivity. Therefore, the development of novel SET7 inhibitors is highly desirable and of great clinical value. In this study, we identified 2-79 as a new hit compound by structure-based virtual screening and further AlphaLISA-based biochemical evaluation. Via chemical optimization, the synthesized compound DC21 was confirmed as a potent SET7 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 15.93 μM. The interaction between DC21 and SET7 was also validated through SPR experiment. Especially, DC21 retarded proliferation of MCF7 cells with an IC50 value of 25.84 μM in cellular level. In addition, DC21 has good selectivity for several other epigenetic targets, such as SUV39H1, G9a, NSD1, DOT1L and MOF. DC21 can serve as a lead compound to develop more potential SET7 inhibitors and as a chemical probe for SET7 biological function studies.
