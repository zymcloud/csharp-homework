Unresectable nodular and diffuse hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. Systemic traditional chemotherapy has been only rarely reported, with unsatisfactory results. The aim of this prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded, single center clinical trial was to investigate safety profile, objective response rate, time to progression and overall survival of sorafenib in comparison with metronomic chemotherapy (MC) consisting of thalidomide, piroxicam and cyclophosphamide in dogs with advanced, unresectable HCC. Between December 2011 and June 2017, 13 dogs were enrolled: seven received sorafenib, and six were treated with MC. Median time to progression was 363 days (95% CI, 191-535) in dogs treated with sorafenib versus 27 days (95% CI, 0-68) in dogs treated with MC (p = 0.044). Median overall survival was 361 days (95% CI, 0-909) in dogs receiving sorafenib, while 32 days (95% CI, 0-235) in those receiving MC (p = 0.079). Sorafenib seems to be a good candidate for the treatment of dogs with advanced HCC, due to a benefit in disease control and an acceptable safety profile, offering a good basis on which new randomized prospective clinical trials should be undertaken to compare the efficacy and drawback of sorafenib versus MC or traditional chemotherapy.
