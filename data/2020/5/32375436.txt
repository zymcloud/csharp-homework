Objective: To investigate the predictive value of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl- diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) enhanced MRI imaging features combined with quantitative parameters for the pathologic grading of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Eighty patients (65 males, 15 females; range 30-74 years,average age (59±11) years old) with HCC who underwent curative resection or biopsy from June 2016 to June 2019 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University after Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI were evaluated retrospectively.According to the pathological results of the postoperative pathology, eighty patients were divided into poorly differentiated group (26 cases, 22 males, 4 females) and moderately-well differentiated group (54 cases, 43 males, 11 females). In Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, qualitative parameters were assessed. Quantitative parameters including tumor size, tumor-to-liver signal intensity ratio(SIR) of arterial phase (AP), portal vein phase (PP), equilibrium phase (EP) and hepatobiliary phase (HBP), contrast enhancement ration AP (CER-AP)were measured and calculated. Clinical data and qualitative parameters between poorly differentiated group and moderately-well differentiated group were analyzed by using χ(2) test.Quantitative parameters were analyzed by using independent sample t test. Statistically significant qualitative parameters, quantitative parameters, qualitative combined with quantitative parameters and AFP combined with qualitative and quantitative parameters were included in binary logistic regression model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the four prediction model for the pathologic grading of HCC. Results: There was a statistical difference between poorly differentiated group and moderately-well differentiated group in AFP, arterial peritumoral enhancement, arterial rim enhancement, peritumoral hypointensity on HBP and tumor signal (all P<0.05). In two groups, tumor size, SIR-AP and SIR-PP were (7.0±3.7) vs (3.9±2.4)cm,1.11±0.29 vs 1.31±0.32 and 0.89±0.21 vs 1.03±0.27 (all P<0.05). AUC of qualitative parameters, quantitative parameters, qualitative combined with quantitative parameters and AFP combined with qualitative and quantitative parameters were 0.805, 0.804, 0.855, 0.892.There was a statistical difference between qualitative parameters and qualitative combined with quantitative parameters in sensitivity(80.8% vs 92.3%, P<0.05). Conclusion: Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI imaging features combined with quantitative parameters can be used to predict the pathologic grading of HCC preoperatively, which has a great applicative value.
