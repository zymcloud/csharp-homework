Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common global malignancies with increasing morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression levels and prognostic value of microRNA-3607 (miR-3607) in patients with HCC.Methods:The expression of miR-3607 was estimated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of miR-3607. The functional role of miR-3607 in HCC progression was further assessed using gain- and loss-of-function experiments. Bioinformatics analysis and a dual-luciferase reporter assay were used to explore the direct targets of miR-3607.Results:miR-3607 expression was found to be significantly decreased in HCC tissues and cells compared with the matched tissues and cells (P Conclusion:The data of this study indicated that the decreased expression of miR-3607 in HCC predicts poor prognosis and the overexpression of miR-3607 in HCC cells can suppress the tumor progression by targeting TGFBR1. This study provides a novel insight into the prognosis and treatment of HCC, and miR-3607 serves as a candidate prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of HCC.
