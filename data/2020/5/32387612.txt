Synthesis of new hydrazinocurcumin derivative 4-((E)-2-(1-(4-Methoxy benzyl)-6-p-tolylpyridazin-3-yl)-3-((E)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)vinyl)-2-methoxyphenol (HCUR) through the reaction of curcumin (CUR) with 1- (4-(2-Methoxybenzyl)-6-p-tolylpyridazin-3-yl)hydrazine(VII). Nanoparticles formulations of (HCUR) loaded chitosan (CS), ZnO, Au, CS-ZnO and CS-Au NPs, via self-assembling process were developed to give CS-HCUR NPs, ZnO-HCUR NPs, Au-HCUR NPs, CS-ZnO-HCUR NPs and CS-Au-HCUR NPs. Chemical structures of (HCUR) and (HCUR) loaded nanoparticles formulations were characterized by UV-Vis, FTIR, Mass Spectrum, Elemental Analysis, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, TGA, DSC, SEM and TEM. The particle size of the nanoformulations ranged from 16.8 to 59.6 nm. NPs formulations were used as delivery system to sustain controlled drug delivery. Drug release profiles and cytotoxicity of NPs formulations against HCT-116 (colon carcinoma) and HepG-2 (hepatocellular cancer) cell lines were investigated. Drug release studies showed that by decreasing the pH value of release medium from 7.4 to 5.4 increased the release rate of (HCUR) from the NPs formulations. Cell viability study proved that NPs formulations revealed higher activity against HCT- 116 cell than (CUR) especially CS-HCUR NPs which displayed the most active with cell viability 1.80%. Moreover, ZnO-HCUR NPs expressed as the highest cytotoxic effect against HepG-2 cell with cell viability 0.98%.
