Objectives:The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of patients receiving microwave ablation (MWA), either after downstaging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), or without downstaging when meeting initially the Milan criteria.Methods:From January 2012 to January 2018, 66 patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who were downstaged by TACE previous to MWA comprised the study group. The control group comprised 190 patients who underwent MWA as first-line treatment as they met initially the Milan criteria. Cumulative overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were compared. The propensity score analysis was performed to reduce potential bias.Results:Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups after 1:1 propensity score matching. The OS rates were 100%, 79%, and 73% at 1, 3, and 5 years in the downstaging group and 95%, 83%, and 72%, respectively, in the Milan group. The corresponding RFS rate were 77%, 40%, and 31% in the downstaging group and 76%, 45%, and 34% in the Milan group. There were no significant differences in the OS and RFS rates between the two groups (p = 0.981 and p = 0.586).Conclusions:The long-term therapeutic outcomes of MWA for downstaged HCC with TACE were similar to HCC that initially met the Milan criteria.Key points:• Patients treated with MWA of HCC after downstaging with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) were similar to those with HCC that initially met Milan criteria. • Microwave ablation (MWA) can be an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is downstaged to the Milan criteria.
