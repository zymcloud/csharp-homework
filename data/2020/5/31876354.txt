Background and aims:Chronic hepatitis C is the main co-morbidity in adult patients with haemophilia (PwH). It causes progressive liver damage leading to end-stage liver disease and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Eradication of HCV was possible with interferon (IFN)-based regimens in the past and direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) more recently. PwH have been considered "difficult-to-treat" because of several bad predictors of response. The advent of DAAs has provided high rates of sustained virological response (SVR) despite bad prognostic factors. Here, we present the results of antiviral treatment with DAAs in PwH treated in 2 large Italian Hemophilia Treatment Centers.Methods:PwH and chronic hepatitis C sustained by any HCV genotype were eligible for therapy with DAAs, including those with compensated cirrhosis, HIV infection and/or previous failure to IFN-based antiviral therapy. Patients received DAAs for 8-24 weeks according to existing guidelines. SVR was defined as persistent negative serum HCV-RNA at 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR12).Results:Between January 2015 and November 2018, 200 patients aged 21-84 years (median: 50.5) received DAAs. HCV genotype 1 was the most prevalent (158, 79%). Forty patients (20%) were HIV positive, 56 (28%) had cirrhosis and 91 (46%) previously failed interferon-based treatment. Ribavirin was used in 70 (35%). HCV-RNA was undetectable at week 4 in 124/192 (65%) and SVR12 was achieved in 193/195 (99%). No patient had serious side effects related to DAAs.Conclusions:DAAs were safe and highly effective in PwH irrespective of HIV status, stage of liver disease severity and/or previous failure to IFN-based therapy.
