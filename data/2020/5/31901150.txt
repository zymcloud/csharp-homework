Background:Nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1 (NUSAP1) has been identified to be strongly implicated in the carcinogenesis of cervical carcinoma, breast cancer, and liver cancer, and shows a high expression level in bladder cancer, indicating that NUSAP1 might be a potent target for cancer treatment. Using bioinformatics methods, we found that NUSAP1 was a putative target of miR-769-5p. Here, we aimed to explore whether miR-769-5p is involved in bladder cancer progression via targeting NUSAP1.Methods:MiR-769-5p expression patterns in bladder cancer tissues and cells were detected by RT-PCR. Kaplan-Meier was used to determine the clinical effects of miR-769-5p expression levels on the overall survival of bladder cancer patients. Bioinformatics methods were used to predict the binding sites between miR-769-5p and NUSAP1, which was verified by the luciferase gene reporter assay. CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing and transwell chamber experiments were performed to test cell growth, apoptosis, migration and invasion capacities.Results:miR-769-5p was lowly expressed in bladder cancer tissues and cells, which was closely associated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of miR-769-5p induced significant repressions in cell growth, migration, and invasion and caused an obvious increase in cell apoptosis, whereas these tendencies were reversed when NUSAP1 was upregulated.Conclusion:This study demonstrates that miR-769-5p functions as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer via targeting NUSAP1.
