Purpose:We assessed the association of tumor size with patient survival following diagnosis of solitary hepatocellular carcinoma without vascular invasion.Methods:The overall population comprised 638 patients who initially underwent hepatic resection with curative intent for a solitary hepatocellular carcinoma without macroscopic vascular invasion (487 had no microscopic vascular invasion). We set 5 cm as the tumor cutoff size for a solitary tumor based on the Milan criteria, and we used a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and propensity score matching to evaluate the impact of tumor size on survival.Results:Tumor size was significantly associated with a proportional increase in cancer-specific survival in the overall population (P = 0.001) and the subgroup with no microscopic vascular invasion (P = 0.029); however, multivariate analysis revealed no significant risk associated with recurrence-free survival (P = 0.055 and 0.59, respectively). After propensity score matching, the cancer-specific survival of patients with tumors > 5 cm was significantly worse than for those with tumors ≤ 5 cm in the overall population (P = 0.0077); the corresponding 2-year cumulative recurrence rates were 45.8% and 23.5%, respectively (P = 0.0027). Finally, the proportions of extrahepatic to total recurrences were 8% for those with tumors ≤ 5 cm and 29.1% for those with tumors > 5 cm in the unmatched overall population (P Conclusion:Tumor size was associated with recurrence within 2 years of surgery and with poor cancer-specific survival in patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma, even in the absence of microscopic vascular invasion.
