In this study, we reported a 99mTc-labeled integrin α6-targeted peptide as the molecular imaging probe for tumor imaging by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We found that replacing Cys-Cys cyclized RWY peptide (sequence: cCRWYDENAC) with lactam-bridged cyclic cKiE peptide (sequence: cKRWYDENAisoE) did not sacrifice the integrin α6-binding affinity and specificity of cKiE radiotracer. To further improve the radiotracer's tumor targeting capability, the dimerized cKiE peptide (termed cKiE2) was designed, and the corresponding radiotracer 99mTc-cKiE2 was evaluated for tumor uptake and in vivo pharmacokinetics properties in tumor models. We found that cKiE2 showed higher binding affinity to integrin α6 than did monomeric RWY or cKiE peptide. The biodistribution results showed that the tumor uptake of 99mTc-cKiE2 was twice higher than that of 99mTc-RWY (3.20 ± 0.12 vs 1.26 ± 0.06 %ID/g, P < 0.001) at 0.5 h postinjection. The tumor to nontargeting tissue ratios were also enhanced in most normal organs. Specificity of 99mTc-cKiE2 for integrin α6 was demonstrated by competitive blocking of tumor uptake with excess cold peptide (3.20 ± 0.24 to 1.38 ± 0.23 %ID/g, P < 0.001). The integrin α6-positive tumors were clearly visualized by 99mTc-cKiE2/SPECT with low background except with a relatively high kidney uptake. The tumor uptake of 99mTc-cKiE2 correlates well with the tumor integrin α6 expression levels in a linear fashion (R2 = 0.9623). We also compared 99mTc-cKiE2 with an integrin αvβ3-targeted radiotracer 99mTc-3PRGD2 in the orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma tumor models. We found that the orthotopic tumor was clearly visualized with 99mTc-cKiE2. 99mTc-3PRGD2 imaging did not show tumor contours in situ as clearly as 99mTc-cKiE2. The tumor-to-liver ratios of 99mTc-cKiE2 and 99mTc-3PRGD2 were 2.20 ± 0.17 and 0.85 ± 0.20. In conclusion, 99mTc-cKiE2 is an improved SPECT radiotracer for imaging integrin α6-positive tumors and has great potential for further clinical application.
