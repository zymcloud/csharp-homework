Long non-coding RNA gastric cancer associated transcript 3 (GACAT3), is a newly identified non-coding RNA, which has been found to be involved in the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer. However, the biological function of GACAT3 in liver cancer remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine the expression level and function of GACAT3 in liver cancer. The authors cultured liver cancer cells in vitro and GACAT3 was silenced in the cells. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration were determined by MTT assay, flow cytometric analysis and transwell assay, respectively. It was demonstrated that GACAT3 was upregulated in liver cancer tissues. The inhibition of GACAT3 decreased the ability of hepatoma cells to proliferate and migrate, and increased apoptosis of the cells. These findings provide the first evidence, to the best of our knowledge, of the exact role of GACAT3 in liver cancer, suggesting GACAT3 as a potential target for liver cancer therapy in the future.
