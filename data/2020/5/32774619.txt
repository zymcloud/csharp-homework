Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a cancer of global public health concern because of its high incidence and mortality. The impact is greatest in areas with high prevalence of its major risk factors including chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is endemic in Ghana but a comprehensive data on HCC is lacking. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of HCC at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana.Methods:The medical records of 194 HCC cases attended to at the Gastrointestinal Clinic of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital between January 2015 and December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data.Results:The male: female ratio was 2:1 and mean age was 45.2 years. Weight loss and abdominal pain were the major presenting symptoms. No patients were identified through surveillance. HBsAg was positive in 109/145 (75.2%) of cases tested. Sixty-five (59.6%) of 109 HBsAg positives were aware of their HBsAg status but only 3 were receiving medical follow ups prior to the diagnosis of HCC. Raised alpha-fetoprotein level >165.2 IU/ML was found in 53.9%. One hundred and forty-four patients were eligible for only analgesia.Conclusion:HBV infection is the leading aetiologial risk factor associated with HCC. Majority of HBV carriers are aware of their status but do not receive care prior to HCC diagnosis. Majority present late and are eligible for only palliative treatment. Improvement in the health seeking behavior of HBV carriers can aid early detection of HCC.
