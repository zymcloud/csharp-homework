Background:Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), an autophagic gene, has been reported as a vital marker for many diseases and cancers. However, the role of LC3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was not still investigated. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the association of LC3 with its clinicopathological and prognostic in HCC.Methods:We consulted the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang databases for published studies on LC3 in HCC. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to screen the quality of the literature. The statistical analysis was calculated by STATA 14.2.Results:Of the 1329 titles identified, 10 articles involving 949 patients in HCC were included in this meta-analysis. The results of our study show that increased LC3 expression is related to size of tumor, but not to gender, age, number of tumor, liver cirrhosis, HBsAg, TNM stage, alpha fetoprotein, vascular invasion and histological grade. Positive LC3 expression was associated with overall survival by pooled hazard ratio.Conclusions:This meta-analysis indicated that positive LC3 expression was related to size of tumor, and could predict prognosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
