Purpose:We aimed to validate the prognostic predictive power of ADV score (α-FP-des-γ-carboxyprothrombin [DCP]-tumor volume [TV] score, calculated as α-FP [ng/mL] × DCP [mAU/mL] × TV [mL] and expressed in log10) for predicting patient survival after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This study included 1,390 patients with HCC registered in the Korea Liver Cancer Registry. Patients underwent hepatic resection between 2008 and 2012 and were followed up until December 2016. They were divided into 4 groups according to the number of tumors and preoperative treatment.Results:There was no significant correlation among α-FP, DCP, and TV values (r2 ≤ 0.04, P < 0.001). In group 1 with single treatment-naive tumor (n = 1,154), patient stratification with postoperative ADV 1log-interval and cutoffs of 5log, 7log, and 10log showed great prognostic contrast (P < 0.001). In group 2 with multiple treatment-naive tumors (n = 170), patient stratification with postoperative ADV 1log-interval and above-mentioned 3 cutoffs also showed great prognostic contrast (P < 0.001). In group 3 (n = 50) and group 4 (n = 16) with preoperative-treated tumors, patient stratification with postoperative ADV 1log-interval and above-mentioned 3 cutoffs showed noticeable prognostic contrast (P ≤ 0.031). Preoperative ADV score based on preoperative findings also showed great prognostic contrast in 1,106 patients preoperatively diagnosed as having single treatment-naive tumor (P < 0.001). Confining patients to tumor-node-metastasis stages I and II (n = 1,072) as well as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 and A (n = 862), postoperative ADV cutoffs showed further prognostic stratification.Conclusion:This validation study strongly suggests that ADV score is an integrated surrogate marker for postresection prognosis in patients with HCC.
