Objective: To investigate the clinical efficacy radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with (125)I radioactive seed implantation in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC with the tumor diameter 3-5 cm. Methods: One hundred patients with HCC diagnosed clinically or pathologically with Barcelona staging of B or C in Lishui Central Hospital from February 2012 to September 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Of the included 100 cases, 89 were males and 11 were females with the mean age of 18-80 (57±11) years old.According to the treatment modality, the subjects were divided into control group (RFA, n=67) and combined group (RFA+(125)I, n=33). Patients in control group were only received RFA and cases in combined group received RFA plus sequenced with (125)I implantation therapy. The prognosis of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between the two groups were compared through the Kaplan-Meier curve and Log-rank test. Results: The median follow-up time period was 6-55 months in the last follow-up time point of Dec 30, 2017. The median PFS were 4-55 (23.0±4.7) and 1-53 (12.0±1.6) months for combined and control groups respectively with significant statistical difference (P=0.015). The median OS were 6-55 (42.0±7.9) and 2-55 (38.0±2.8) months for combined and control groups with the trend of improvement in combined group, but without statistical difference (P=0.444). Subgroup analysis further indicated that the PFS was significant improved in patients with residual tumor lesions who received the combined treatment (PFS: 18 vs 9 months, P=0.025). However, there was no statistical difference for PFS between the control and combined treatment groups for cases without residual tumor lesions after RAF treatment(P=0.685). Conclusions: PFS was obviously increased in HCC patients(tumor diameter 3-5 cm) who received(125)I implantation after radiofrequency ablation, especially for cases with residual tumor lesions.
