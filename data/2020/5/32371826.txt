Background and aim:Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and entecavir are effective antiviral medications that are recommended as first-line monotherapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection, including decompensated liver cirrhosis with ascites. Acute kidney injury (AKI) commonly occurs in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The aim of this study was to compare the development of AKI during TDF and entecavir treatment of CHB patients with cirrhotic refractory ascites.Methods:From January 2011 to April 2017, we identified patients who were diagnosed with cirrhosis with refractory ascites and received TDF or entecavir treatments at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of more than 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5-fold from baseline. All episodes of AKI were recorded and compared between those who received TDF and entecavir.Results:A total of 111 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study, of which 22 patients were treated with TDF and 89 were treated with entecavir. Patients with AKI episodes had a higher proportion of TDF treatment (P = 0.01), male (P = 0.023), hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.007), admission (P = 0.045), and mortality (P = 0.018). Logistic regression analysis illustrated that TDF treatment of patients with comorbidity was an independent risk factor for the development of AKI [odds ratio (OR), 3.756; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.293-10.912; P = 0.015] and hepatorenal syndrome (OR, 7.651; 95% CI, 1.697-34.508; P = 0.008).Conclusions:TDF treatment is a risk factor for AKI and HRS development in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites in comparison with entecavir treatment, especially in patients with comorbidity.
