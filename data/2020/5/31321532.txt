Background:Repeat liver resection is an effective treatment approach for patients with recurrent hepatocellular cell carcinoma (HCC). However, the surgical feasibility and oncological significance of repeat laparoscopic liver resection (r-LLR) remain unproven. This study evaluates and compares the clinical outcomes of non-anatomic r-LLR applied towards recurrent HCC, with those of primary LLR (p-LLR) for primary HCC.Methods:This retrospective study reports 104 patients with HCC, treated with LLR between 2014 and 2018. Twenty eight of these patients underwent r-LLR for recurrent HCC. The clinical and surgical variables were reviewed for all cases.Results:The analysis was limited to non-anatomic resection across both groups (r-LLR: 89% (25/28) vs. p-LLR: 80% (61/76)). There were no statistically significant differences about patient background between the two groups, with the exception of Child-Pugh classification. r-LLR surgical techniques included single-site laparoscopic adhesiolysis (32%, 8/25), Pringle maneuver (8%, 2/25), and crush-clamp method using BiClamp for hepatic parenchymal transection (72%, 18/25). No severe postoperative complications were observed in the r-LLR group. Postoperative hospital stays and procedure-related postoperative survival were similar for both groups.Conclusions:Non-anatomical r-LLR renders comparable surgical and oncological outcomes. Our data suggest that non-anatomical r-LLR is a safe and feasible therapeutic approach to recurrent HCC.
