Background:The high mobility group box 1 (hmgb1) is one of the frequently over-expressed genes whose aberrant expression is reported in a number of human cancers. Various strategies are underway to inhibit hmgb1 expression in cancer cells having considerable therapeutic value.Objective:The present work involves selective transcriptional inhibition of the hmgb1 gene using selective DNA triplex structure-based gene technology. Here, the promoter region of the hmgb1 gene at position (-183 to -165) from the transcription start site as a target was selected using bioinformatic tools.Methods:The DNA triplex formation by the DNA of the target gene and TFO was confirmed using UV absorption spectroscopy, Circular Dichroism, and Isothermal Calorimetry.Results:Treatment of HepG2 cell with specific Triplex-forming Oligonucleotide significantly downregulated HMGB1 expression level at mRNA and protein levels by 50%, while the classical anticancer drugs, actinomycin/ adriamycin as positive controls showed 65% and the combination of TFO and drug decreased by 70%. The anti-proliferative effects of TFO correlated well with the fact of accumulation of cells in the Go phase and apoptotic cell death. Further, the binding of anti-cancer drugs to hmgb1 is stronger in DNA triplex state as compared to hmgb1 alone, suggesting the combination therapy as a better option.Conclusion:Therefore, the ability of hmgb1 targeted triplex-forming oligonucleotide in combination with triplex selective anticancer drug holds promise in the treatment of malignancies associated with hmgb1 overexpression. The result obtained may open up new vistas to provide a basis for the rational drug design and searching for high-affinity ligands with a high triplex selectivity.
