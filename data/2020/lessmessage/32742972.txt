Fontan procedure, in which systemic circulation is redirected into pulmonary circulation by a baffle, is a palliative surgical strategy for patients born with single ventricle congenital heart disease. Hemodynamic changes secondary to Fontan procedure, also termed as Fontan physiology, result in end-organ damage, especially of the liver. Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) represents a spectrum of pathologies ranging from mild liver fibrosis to advanced liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatic nodules, some of which have been documented as HCC in several case series and reports, are a recognized complicated feature of FALD. Herein, we report a case with benign hepatic nodules mimicking HCC by imaging characteristics, emphasizing the fact that arterially enhancing lesions with delayed washout appearance may reflect benign regenerative or focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules in patients with Fontan physiology.How to cite this article:Ã‡olaklar A, Lehnert SJ, Tirkes T.
