Background/aim:Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is a treatment option for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with extensive liver metastasis (LM); however, the appropriate regimen and the treatment effects have not been discussed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HAIC with the 5-FU, epirubicin, and mitomycin-C (FEM) regimen.Patients and methods:We reviewed MBC patients with critical LM who were resistant to standard systemic chemotherapies and had received HAIC with an FEM regimen.Results:We identified 57 patients who received HAIC between 2003 and 2017. The patient characteristics were as follows: i) median age=56 (30-80), and ii) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, 0/1/2=43/11/3. The median number of LMs was 8 (range 1 to â‰¥20), the median diameter of LM was 5.2 cm (range=1.6 to 20.1). The median overall survival from the initiation of HAIC was 11.3 months (95% confidence interval=8.5-15.6). The objective response rate of LM was 63%.Conclusion:HAIC with an FEM regimen is an effective salvage treatment for MBC patients with advanced LM.
