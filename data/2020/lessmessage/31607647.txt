Introduction and objectives:The Baveno VI criteria to rule out varices needing treatment (VNT) was introduced in 2015. Soon after, the expanded Baveno VI and stepwise platelet-MELD criteria were proposed to be equal/more accurate in ruling out VNT; however, neither has been widely validated. We aimed to validate all 3 criteria in compensated cirrhosis from assorted causes.Materials and methods:We conducted a cross-sectional study including all adult compensated cirrhotic patients who underwent endoscopic surveillance at our center from 2014 to 2018 and had transient elastography (TE), and laboratory data for criteria calculation within 6 months of endoscopies. Exclusion criteria were previous decompensation, unreliable/invalid TE results, and liver cancer. The diagnostic performances of all criteria were evaluated.Results:A total of 128 patients were included. The major cirrhosis etiologies were hepatitis C and B (37.5% and 32.8%, respectively). VNT was observed in 7.8%. All criteria yielded high negative predictive values (NPVs)>95%, missed VNT was observed in 2%, 2.7%, and 2.8% in the original, expanded Baveno VI, and platelet-MELD criteria, respectively. The expanded Baveno VI and the platelet-MELD criteria yielded significantly better specificities and could spare more endoscopies than the original Baveno VI criteria.Conclusions:All 3 criteria showed satisfactorily high NPVs in ruling out VNT in compensated cirrhosis from various causes. The expanded Baveno VI and the platelet-MELD criteria could spare more endoscopies than the original Baveno VI criteria. From a public health standpoint, the platelet-MELD criteria might be useful in a resource-limited setting where TE is not widely available.
