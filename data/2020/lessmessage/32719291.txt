Distant metastases in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck are uncommon, and the incidence rises with neck node metastasis. The lung, liver, and bones are the common possible sites for distant metastasis. Cutaneous and cardiac metastases are extremely rare situations with aggressive behaviors and present in the late course of the disease. Here, we report a case of anterior tongue cancer with cutaneous, bone, cardiac, lung, and soft tissue of right suprascapular area metastases after a gap of 2 years of follow-up of completion of treatment with radical surgery and adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation therapy. The present case developed such type of aggressive distant metastases without any locoregional recurrence and died within 6 months of diagnosis of distant metastases.
