Hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma are the most common cancers of the liver. In this study, our first aim is to evaluate the relationship between prognosis and clinicopathological parameters. The second aim involves investigating the need for immunohistochemical staining and patterns of tumours to differentiate between them. Sixty-one cases were included in this study. For IHC, we used Hep par-1, CK7, CK19, CD56 and p53 staining, and the patterns of tumours were evaluated in haematoyxylin-eosin sections. No significant differences were found in Kaplan-Meier life analysis between the tumour types and OS and DFS values, but these values were greater in HCC than in ICC. There were no relationships between clinicopathologic parameters and OS and DFS. Although the multifocality, stage and grade of tumour were higher in HCC than in ICC, the perineural invasion and lymph node metastasis were more common in ICC than in HCC. The diagnosis was changed in 4 cases, from HCC to ICC in one case and to combined type in 3 cases after IHC. Pathologist should be alert to mixed patterns in terms of diagnosis and IHC, because it helps differential diagnosis in these cases.
