Background/aim:Translation plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of various human tumors. Paip1 and eIF4A1 are translation-associated proteins that mediate the function of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F complex. This study aimed to analyse the relationship between the expression status of Paip1 and eIF4A1 and clinicopathologic features in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate the expression status of Paip1 and eIF4A1. Two pathologists independently interpreted the immunostained slides. The prognostic value of Paip1 and eIF4A1 was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier plotter.Results:Among 173 HCC patients, 28 (16.1%) and 46 (26.6%) belonged in the Paip1 and eIF4A1 high-expression groups. High expression of Paip1 and eIF4A1 was associated with advanced TNM stage and more frequent vascular tumor invasion. Univariate analysis indicated that high Paip1 expression was associated with worse five-year overall survival (OS). Public dataset analysis by Kaplan-Meier plotter revealed that high mRNA expression of Paip1, and not of eIF4A1, was significantly associated with worse five-year OS and disease-free survival.Conclusion:Paip1 expression has a potential prognostic value in human HCC.
