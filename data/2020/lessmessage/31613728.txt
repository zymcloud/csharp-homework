Objective:The reaction of bis(4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol) with hydrazonoyl halides and α-halo-ketones gave a new series of bis-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b]thiadiazine derivatives.Methods:The structure of the new products was established on the basis of their elemental and spectral data (mass, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and IR) and an alternate method.Results:Several of the synthesized products were subjected to in vitro anticancer screening against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2) and the results showed that compounds 16, 14 and 12 have promising activities (IC50 value of 24.8±9.1, 28.3±0.5, and 31±2.9μM, respectively) compared with Harmine reference drug (IC50 value of 22.4±1.11 μM).Conclusion:Moreover, molecular docking studies were performed to analyze the binding modes of the discovered hits into the active site of DYRK1A using iGEMDOCK.
