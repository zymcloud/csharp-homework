Background:Chronic infection with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered as a major cause for developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A new era in HCV treatment is ongoing using Direct Acting Antiviral activity (DAA). The first approved DAA drug was Sofosbuvir which has a high tolerability and preferable pharmacokinetic profile. Another recently developed drug is Daclatasvir a first-in-class HCV NS5A replication complex inhibitor. Both drugs are administered orally once daily and have potent antiviral activity with wide genotypic coverage.Methods:In the outpatient clinic, one hundred and fifty naïve difficult to treat chronic HCV patients were recruited from Tropical Medicine Department at Fayoum public hospital. A combination of Daclatasvir (60 mg) and Sofosbuvir (400 mg) (DCV/SOF) has been administered for those patients once daily with Ribavirin (1200 mg or 1000 mg based on patients' weight on two divided doses) over a period of 12 weeks. All patients have been followed up for clinical, laboratory assessment and HCV PCR to detect the efficacy and safety of the therapy.Results:Sustained Virologic Response rate (SVR12) was achieved in the vast majority of patients (90.67%). Cirrhotic patients showed lower SVR compared to non-cirrhotic patients (88.89% vs 90.91%, respectively). Around half of the patients (49.33%) developed adverse events (AEs) during treatment. The most common AEs were headache, fatigue and abdominal pain.Conclusion:The available evidence seems to suggest that combination therapy of (DCV/SOF with RBV) in the treatment of chronic HCV genotype IV naïve difficult to treat patients either cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic is safe and effective. Monitoring for clinical and laboratory hepatic parameters was the basis for these findings.
