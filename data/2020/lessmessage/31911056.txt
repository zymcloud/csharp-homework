Background:Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment in selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Morphologic criteria alone are not sufficient to predict survival. In this study, we investigated the clinical, biochemical, and pathologic factors affecting survival in patients who underwent LT due to HCC.Methods:Between October 2011 and January 2018, 165 of 749 LT for HCC cases performed at the Memorial Atasehir Hospital were evaluated retrospectively. Survival, demographic characteristics and etiology, preoperative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, prognostic staging, and morphologic and histologic properties were evaluated.Results:One hundred and thirty-nine cases of 165 were living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). The mean age was 57.7 ± 7.3 years, the mean follow-up period was 27.8 ± 20 months, and 41 patients (24%) died before follow-up. Recurrence of HCC was detected in 23 (14%) cases. Overall survival was 85%, 71%, and 64% for 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. In terms of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival within vs beyond Milan criteria was 90%, 80%, and 76% vs 75%, 66%, and 44%, respectively. In the University of California San Francisco criteria, it was 86%, 76%, and 70% vs 76%, 60%, and 30% compared with 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival. While histopathological poor differentiation and AFP elevation affected the course negatively. Good differentiation did not have a significant effect on survival. It was determined that poor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, and an increased number of nodules significantly affected survival in both within and beyond cases.Conclusion:A transplant decision is controversial in patients with HCC with other than previously defined morphologic criteria. In these cases, AFP level and histologic differentiation determine survival. The results were not satisfactory in both high and/or poorly differentiated cases.
