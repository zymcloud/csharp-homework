Background/aim:A recent planning study suggested that 99mTc-labelled diethylene triamine pentaacetate-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image-guided inverse planning (IGIP) shows dosimetric superiority to conventional planning in sparing liver function. Here, we report the first clinical translation of 99mTc-GSA SPECT IGIP for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Case report:A 60-year-old male developed obstructive jaundice caused by recurrent HCC in segment 1 after hepatic resection. He underwent repeated radiotherapy (RT) consisting of 45 Gy in 15 fractions 8 years ago and 30 Gy in 5 fractions 2 years ago. We performed SBRT consisting of 40 Gy in 8 fractions using 99mTc-GSA SPECT-IGIP. We confirmed the dosimetric superiority of functional IGIP to conventional planning. He achieved complete response as assessed using the target volume. The patient has remained alive without recurrence for 18 months. He did not experience radiation-induced liver disease.Conclusion:Recurrent HCC was successfully and safely salvaged via re-irradiation with SBRT using 99mTc-GSA SPECT-IGIP.
