Background: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous microwave ablation with artificial ascites for problematic hepatocellular tumors.Methods: Forty-eight patients with 61 problematic hepatocellular carcinomas who underwent CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation with artificial ascites were reviewed retrospectively. Lesions less than 5 mm away from the gastrointestinal system, diaphragm, pericardium or kidney were defined as problematic tumors with the potential risk of thermal damage. Microwave ablation was performed after artificial ascites was established between tumors and the adjacent high-risk organs. The technical effectiveness of microwave ablation, local tumor progression and complications was assessed.Results: Microwave ablation with artificial ascites was successfully performed in all 61 tumors. The technical effectiveness rate was 100% with contrast-enhanced CT performed immediately after the ablation procedure. Local tumor progression occurred in three (6%) of the 48 patients during the follow-up period (mean, 15 months; range, 6-24 months). No major complications related to the procedure occurred.Conclusion: CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation with artificial ascites is a feasible, safe and effective choice for treating problematic hepatocellular tumors, avoiding potential thermal damage to the adjacent high-risk organs.
