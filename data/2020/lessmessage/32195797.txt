Objective:The aim of this study was to determine if texture analysis can classify liver observations likely to be hepatocellular carcinoma based on the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) using single portal venous phase computed tomography.Methods:This research ethics board-approved retrospective cohort study included 64 consecutive LI-RADS observations. Individual observation texture analysis features were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and 2 sample t tests. Logistic regression was used for prediction of LI-RADS group. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and Youden method.Results:Multiple texture features were associated with LI-RADS including the mean HU (P = 0.003), median (P = 0.002), minimum (P = 0.010), maximum (P = 0.013), standard deviation (P = 0.009), skewness (P = 0.007), and entropy (P Conclusions:Texture analysis features on portal venous phase computed tomography can identify liver observations likely to be hepatocellular carcinoma, which may preclude the need to recall some patients for additional multiphase imaging.
