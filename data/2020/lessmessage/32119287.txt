Public health officials have ranked the reduction in vaccine-preventable diseases as one of the top 10 public health achievements in the 21 century. Hepatitis B vaccine is an integral part of this achievement, and its role continues to evolve this century. Hepatitis B vaccination is indicated to prevent active infection with the hepatitis B virus, which can lead to chronic liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The virus is highly infectious and can transmit through percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood and body fluids. The virus even remains viable on environmental surfaces for more than seven days.
