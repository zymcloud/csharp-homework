Purpose:To assess the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy using an abdominal compression technique and modified fractionation regimen (5-10 fractions) in patients with small-sized hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A total of 101 patients with small-sized hepatocellular carcinoma treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy using an abdominal compression technique and modified fractionation regimen were registered between June 2011 and June 2019 in our hospital. A total dose of 48 to 60 Gy was applied over 5 to 14 consecutive days. Liver motion was controlled by abdominal compression, and a helical intensity-modified radiation therapy-based stereotactic body radiation therapy administrated in tomotherapy platform.Results:The median follow-up period was 23.2 months (range: 4.1-99.2 months). Complete response and partial response were observed in 63 (62.4%) patients and in 24 (23.8%) patients, respectively. At the time of our analysis, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year local control rates after stereotactic body radiation therapy were 96.1%, 89.0%, and 89.0%, respectively. However, logistic regression analysis revealed no correlation between the biologically effective dose and 3-year local control rates. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 96.9%, 69.0%, and 64.3%, respectively. For patients who were treatment-naive, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival were 96.3%, 82.0%, and 82.0%, respectively. No patients experienced classic radiation-induced liver disease or nonclassic radiation-induced liver disease after stereotactic body radiation therapy completion.Conclusions:When using an abdominal compression technique and modified fractionation regimen (5-10 fractions) based on helical intensity-modified radiation therapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy led to a lower toxicity and comparative rate of local control and overall survival for patients who with small-sized hepatocellular carcinoma.
