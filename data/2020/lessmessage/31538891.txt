Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses associated with chronic diseases in humans are major threats to public health causing high mortality globally. The high mutation rate of RNA viruses helps them to escape the immune response and also is responsible for the development of drug resistance. Chronic infections caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis viruses (HBV and HCV) lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hepatocellular carcinoma respectively, which are one of the major causes of human deaths. Effective preventative measures to limit chronic and re-emerging viral infections are absolutely necessary. Each class of antiviral agents targets a specific stage in the viral life cycle and inhibits them from its development and proliferation. Most often, antiviral drugs target a specific viral protein, therefore only a few broad-spectrum drugs are available. This review will be focused on the selected viral target proteins of pathogenic viruses containing single-stranded (ss) RNA genome that causes chronic infections in humans (e.g. HIV, HCV, Flaviviruses). In the recent past, an exponential increase in the number of available three-dimensional protein structures (>150000 in Protein Data Bank), allowed us to better understand the molecular mechanism of action of protein targets and antivirals. Advancements in the in silico approaches paved the way to design and develop several novels, highly specific small-molecule inhibitors targeting the viral proteins.
