Introduction:Survivin expression is well known feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, there is no information about survivin expression in chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Aim:Investigating survivin expression in the liver of CHB patients.Material and methods:This is a single-centre, cross-sectional study. Seventy-five CHB patients and eight control patients were enrolled into the study between 2008 and 2018. Immunohistochemical study was performed by using anti-survivin antibody to evaluate survivin immunoreactivity.Results:Survivin immunoreactivity was significantly higher in CHB patients compared to controls (p = 0.008). Also, the degree of survivin immunoreactivity was significantly higher in CHB patients (p = 0.027). Between the anti-survivin-positive and anti-survivin-negative groups, baseline laboratory parameters and initial pathology features were not significantly different.Conclusions:This is the first study evaluating survivin expression in CHB patients. Understanding the possible relationship between survivin expression and HCC development in this population can promote new studies in terms of new therapies and treatment timing.
