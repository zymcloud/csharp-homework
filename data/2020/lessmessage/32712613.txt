Objective:Functional hepatic reserve is important when considering sequential tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We assessed albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score and Child-Pugh class as indices of liver function during sorafenib and lenvatinib treatment.Methods:A total of 212 patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh class A status who initiated TKI treatment at our hospital were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. A total of 74 of the 212 patients underwent blood testing before starting sorafenib treatment and every 2 months after treatment initiation.Results:In 74 patients, the median ALBI score before TKI treatment was -2.53, and after 2, 4, and 6 months it was -2.45, -2.44, and -2.36, respectively. ALBI scores tended to increase during TKI therapy. Among patients who experienced a time to progression â‰¤3.8 months, ALBI scores had increased 2 months after treatment initiation, and at 4 and 6 months, significant differences were observed (p Conclusion:ALBI scores deteriorate in patients treated with TKIs, suggesting that tumor progression induces these changes.
