Cirrhosis of the liver is increasing, with growing patient numbers in hospital outpatient departments, as well as increasing admissions due to decompensated liver disease. Decompensated cirrhosis of the liver is a common and debilitating illness causing disability, readmissions to hospital, and decreased quality of life, and can lead to liver cancer. The advent of the chronic liver disease nurse (CLDN) position in our hospital in 2009 was the first role in Australia dedicated to providing care to patients with cirrhosis. The role incorporates the care of patients with stable compensated disease, case management of patients with complications of decompensated disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma coordination. After a pilot randomized controlled trial and almost 10 years of service, this article describes the role of the CLDN and presents key performance indicators that will assist other centers considering introducing the role or elements of it into their service.
