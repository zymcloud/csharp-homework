Background:Recently, new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are known to eradicate chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection and prevent the progression of liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis may predispose to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. We investigated the effect of DAAs on liver fibrosis using non-invasive methods, and evaluated the correlations of these methods.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 68 patients with CHC who were treated with DAAs and reached sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment from January 2016 to October 2018. The degree of liver fibrosis was assessed using serum biomarkers, such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index. Liver stiffness was assessed using two-dimensional shear-wave elastography (2 D-SWE). The pre- and post-treatment serum biomarker levels and SWE findings were evaluated and compared.Results:A total of 68 patients with CHC were enrolled. The median age was 58 years (52.3-73 years) and 37 patients (54.4%) were female. After treatment, the median APRI was decreased from 0.701 to 0.328 (P Conclusion:The serum fibrosis biomarkers and liver stiffness on 2 D-SWE were shown to be improved after the treatment with DAAs. Further research including larger number of patients is needed to compare the efficacy of each evaluating method.
