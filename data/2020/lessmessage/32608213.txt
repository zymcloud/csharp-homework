Accepted as crucial participators in human diseases, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to play important roles in cancer progression, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study is to preliminarily elucidate the role of miR-369-3p in HCC. Here, miR-369-3p and PAX6 expressions were detected by RT-qPCR. The functional mechanism of miR-369-3p/PAX6 axis was investigated by MTT, Transwell and luciferase reporter assays. The results showed that miR- 369-3p was downregulated in HCC and was associated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in HCC patients. Functionally, miR-369-3p overexpression inhibited cell viability and motility in HCC. Furthermore, PAX6 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-369-3p, and upregulation of PAX6 exerts carcinogenesis in the development of HCC. PAX6 can weaken the inhibitory effect of miR-369-3p in HCC. In conclusion, miR-369-3p inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells by suppressing PAX6 expression.
