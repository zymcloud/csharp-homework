Transarterial chemoembolization using doxorubicin (TACE-DOX) is an effective therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there are limited options for patients with TACE refractoriness. We compared the effectiveness between sorafenib and transarterial chemolipiodolization using epirubicin and cisplatin combined with systemic infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; TACL-ECF) in patients with previous TACE-DOX refractoriness. We retrospectively analyzed 742 consecutively enrolled cohort patients who received TACE-DOX as the first-line therapy for HCC. Among the 94 patients who failed with TACE-DOX, 49 patients were treated with TACL-ECF and 45 patients were treated with sorafenib as a rescue therapy. The TACL-ECF regimen comprised transarterial infusion of epirubicin and cisplatin combined with systemic infusion of 5-FU. Of the 94 patients, 22 and 72 patients were in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stages B and C, respectively; 66% patients were classified as having Child-Pugh class A (CPC A). Overall survival (OS) after rescue therapy did not differ between the sorafenib and TACL-ECF groups (4.1 months vs 6.4 months, P = .355). Progression-free survival (PFS) did not differ between the sorafenib and TACL-ECF groups (2.8 months vs 3.5 months, P = .629). Adverse events of CTC grade 3/4 occurred more frequently in the sorafenib group than in the TACL-ECF group (P = .024). The present study showed that the OS and PFS did not differ between patients given rescue TACL-ECF therapy and those given sorafenib therapy. The TACL-ECF treatment was better tolerated than sorafenib. The TACL-ECF might be considered as an alternative therapy for the patients with TACE-DOX refractoriness, especially CPC B and sorafenib-intolerant patients.
