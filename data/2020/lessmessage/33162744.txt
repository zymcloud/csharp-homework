Background:Prognostic indicators in patients with decompensated cirrhosis are vital for the estimation of death risk. The ratio of C-reactive protein to albumin (CAR) has been verified as a prognostic marker in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and decompensated cirrhosis related to hepatitis B virus. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and gamma globulins have been separately studied in cirrhosis. We evaluated the predictive role of CAR and other inflammatory markers in decompensated patients.Methods:We prospectively studied 159 patients with stable decompensated cirrhosis, calculating the following indexes: CAR, NLR, LMR, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD).Results:MELD (area under the curve [AUC] 0.814) and CTP score (AUC 0.752) were superior to the other markers above in predicting patients' mortality (PConclusion:Our findings demonstrate the significance of CAR and LMR in the outcome and renal function of decompensated patients.
