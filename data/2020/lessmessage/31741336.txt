Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains the leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality across the world. If left untreated, approximately one-third of these patients will progress to severe end-stage liver diseases including liver failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High level of serum HBV DNA is strongly associated with the development of liver failure, cirrhosis, and HCC. Therefore, antiviral therapy is crucial for the clinical management of CHB. Current antiviral drugs including nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) and interferon-α (IFN-α) can suppress HBV replication and reduce the progression of liver disease, thus improving the long-term outcomes of CHB patients. This chapter will discuss the standard and optimization antiviral therapies in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients, as well as in the special populations. The up-to-date advances in the development of new anti-HBV agents will be also discussed. With the combination of the current antiviral drugs and the newly developed antiviral agents targeting the different steps of the viral life cycle or the newly developed agents modulating the host immune responses, the ultimate eradication of HBV will be achieved in the future.
