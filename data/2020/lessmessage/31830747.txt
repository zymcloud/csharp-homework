A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rarely expands into the biliary tract. In this situation, because of its hypervascular nature, cholangitis or hemobilia may sometimes occur. Surgery is one of the options in this situation. However, patients with HCC and bile duct invasion are sometimes in a poor general condition, as in the case presented in this report. For such patients, surgical treatment may need to be invasive. Thus, here we report technical tips for triple covered metal stent deployment using side-by-side technique for hemobilia due to HCC. After guidewire deployments at the left, anterior, and posterior bile ducts, 6-mm covered self-expandable metal stents were placed at each bile duct. This may be useful for high-grade hepatic hilar obstruction due to HCC because drainage and hemostasis effects are obtained.
