Purpose:Cancer is the leading cause of death in economically developed countries and the second leading cause of death in developing countries. The relationship between genetic polymorphisms and cancer risk has been extensively researched. In the present study, we evaluated the association between polymorphisms in two DNA repair genes, ERCC2 Lys751Gln (rs13181) and XRCC2 Arg188His (rs3218536) and the risk of colorectal, stomach, HCC, prostate and lung cancer.Methods:This study was planned by the Medical Biology Unit and Department of Internal Medicine, Pathology and Surgical Medicine Sciences of Ataturk University. A total of 40 colon cancer, 40 gastric cancer, 40 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 40 prostate cancer, and 40 lung cancer patients and 40 healthy individuals over 18 years of age were enrolled in the study (Controls). All patients and healthy subjects underwent ERCC2 Lys751Gln rs13181 and XRCC2 Arg188His rs3218536 genotyping. After collection of 10 ml venous blood from the patients, DNA was isolated and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed using Roche 480 Real-Time PCR device. Results were analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 software.Results:There were statistically significant differences in ERCC2 Lys751Gln rs13181 polymorphism variants GG colon and GT in the colon control and GG,TTprostate cancer groups when compared with the control group.. GG variant of XRCC2 Arg188 rs3218536 was higher in the gastric patient group. AG variant of XRCC2 Arg188 rs3218536 was higher in gastric control group Conclusion: The results of the present study demonstrate that ERC22 Lys751Gln polymorphisms may be associated with the development of colon and prostate cancers in the Turkish population. This was a small-scale study, and the results should be corroborated with further research including larger groups of patients with each cancer type and more healthy controls.
