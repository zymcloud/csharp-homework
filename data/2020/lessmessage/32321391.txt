Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent and increasing cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide. Reversing this trend is complicated by the varied aetiological factors leading to liver cirrhosis resulting in molecular genetic and clinical heterogeneity, combined with frequent presentation at advanced stage. Large-scale genomic studies have identified alterations in key signalling pathways for HCC development and progression, but these findings have not yet directly influenced patient management in the clinical setting. Despite these translational challenges, a small number of anti-angiogenic systemic therapy agents have succeeded in recent randomized trials enriching the repertoire of available treatments for advanced HCC. In addition, the early promise of immune checkpoint inhibition is now on the cusp of delivering changes to standard systemic therapy algorithms. This review focuses on recent translational and clinical developments that have advanced. current practice and explores the challenges encountered in attempting to improve the outcomes and experience of patients diagnosed with advanced HCC.
