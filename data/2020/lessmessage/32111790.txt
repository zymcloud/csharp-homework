Background:The management of distant metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) relies mainly on chemotherapies and radiotherapy. Management of patients with cSCC with surgically resectable distant metastatic lesions is not clear.Case report:A 59-year-old male had 4Ã—10 cm-sized cSCC on the perianal skin with inguinal lymph node metastasis. Surgical resection was performed followed by radiation and adjuvant carboplatin and farmorubicin combination therapy. Six months later, 25 mm-sized solitary metastatic nodule arose on the liver. Base on his favorable overall condition fulfilling the criteria of tumor resectability for the treatment of tumors in liver and having good performance status, laparoscopic partial hepatectomy and six courses of adjuvant irinotecan therapy were performed. The surgical margin was negative and the patient has maintained complete remission for over 3 years.Conclusion:The clinical course of the present case suggests that surgical approaches should also be considered as candidate additional therapy for resectable distant metastatic cSCC.
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; adjuvant chemotherapy; complete remission; liver metastasis; partial hepatectomy.
