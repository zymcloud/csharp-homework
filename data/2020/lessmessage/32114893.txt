Purpose:The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has recently improved, and so clinicians have greater opportunity to treat HCC-derived spinal metastases. Therefore, predicting life expectancy is important for determining the optimal treatment strategy for such tumors. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors for HCC-derived metastatic spine tumors and to develop a scoring system for predicting life expectancy in such cases.Methods:The posttreatment survival time and factors that might influence it were investigated in 62 patients with HCC-derived metastatic spine tumors who were treated at our department (surgery: 27 patients and conservative treatment: 35 patients), and a prognostic scoring system for predicting life expectancy was developed by combining the factors that significantly influenced survival.Results:In the univariate analyses, sex, the patient's general condition, the presence/absence of major internal organ metastasis, the total revised Tokuhashi score, the serum albumin level, Child-Pugh class, spinal surgery, and bone-modifying agent (BMA) treatment were found to influence the posttreatment survival time. These factors were subjected to multivariate analysis, and a novel scoring system for predicting life expectancy based on the patient's general condition, the serum albumin level (or Child-Pugh class), and BMA treatment was developed. In the retrospective analysis, the concordance rate between the patients' life expectancy and actual survival times was 90.3%.Conclusion:The patient's general condition, the serum albumin level (or Child-Pugh class), and BMA treatment influenced the posttreatment survival times of patients with HCC-derived metastatic spine tumors. A prognostic scoring system based on these factors was proposed.
