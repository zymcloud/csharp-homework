Background/aim:Radiation (RT) induced ERK/NF-κB in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported in our previous works; it weakens the toxicity of RT or triggers a radioresistance effect. Thus, combining RT with a suitable NF-κB inhibitor may sensitize HCC to RT. Magnolol, a bioactive compound, was known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor functions. Here, we aimed to investigate whether magnolol may enhance anti-HCC efficacy of RT in vivo.Materials and methods:We established a Hep3B bearing mouse to evaluate the efficacy of the combination treatment of magnolol and RT.Results:Most significantly, tumor volume and tumor weight inhibition was found in the combination group. Tumor immunohistochemistry staining also illustrated the suppression of RT-induced ERK/NF-κB-related proteins expression by magnolol. In addition, intrinsic apoptosis-related proteins, such as caspase-3 and -9, were markedly increased in the combination group.Conclusion:Magnolol may effectively enhance anti-HCC ability of RT by downregulating the expression of ERK/NF-κB-related proteins and increasing the expression of apoptosis-related proteins.
