Background:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in elderly patients is increasing worldwide. Although open hepatectomy (OH) yields acceptable outcomes, high morbidity rate is concerned. Laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) has evolved to improve perioperative outcomes. However, comparative study between both techniques for elderly patients with HCC is scarce.Objective:This study aimed to compare outcomes between LH and OH specifically.Methods:HCC patients aged â‰¥70 years after hepatectomy (2003-2018) were included. The propensity score matching (PSM) and comparative analyses between groups were performed.Results:After PSM, there were 41 patients in each group with similar demographics, radiographic tumor characteristics, cirrhotic status, and extent of resection. The LH group had a shorter hospital stay (7 vs. 11 days, p = 0.002) compared with the OH group. The completeness of resection and complication rates were not statistically different between groups. The 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates were 86.7 and 43.4% in the LH group and 62.2 and 30.8% in the OH group (p = 0.221 and 0.500).Conclusion:Our study confirmed the operative and oncological safety of LH in elderly HCC patients with improved perioperative outcomes compared with OH.
