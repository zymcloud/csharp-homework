Objectives:Thus far, biological roles of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain controversial. Moreover, its expression, clinicopathologic and prognostic significance in HCC have not been comprehensively investigated, therefore needing further evidence.Methods:PAI1 expression was measured, using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining, in matched HCC and adjacent liver samples from 178 patients with HCC after curative resection. The correlations of PAI1 H-scores with clinicopathologic variables and survival were further evaluated. Its prognostic value was finally confirmed in some public databases.Results:It was found that PAI1 expression was significantly higher in HCC than in adjacent liver tissues. Moreover, high PAI1 expression was more frequent in those with multiple lesions. Univariate analyses showed that PAI1 expression was negatively associated with both overall and relapse-free survival. Although PAI1 expression was not statistically significant in multivariate Cox regression test, combination of it with TNM stage effectively distinguished survival and relapse, and served as an independent prognostic factor. In the online available datasets of HCC and liver cancer used, SERPINE1, the gene encoding PAI1, was also revealed to be prognostic.Conclusions:Our data suggested that high PAI1 expression was predictive for unfavorable biological behavior and long-term prognosis in HCC.
