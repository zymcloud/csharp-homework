Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most frequent chronic liver disease worldwide, with an estimated global prevalence of approximately 25%, that is much higher in patients with overweight, obesity and type 2 diabetes. NAFLD is considered as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. It has a wide spectrum, from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and its complications, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Most of the affected patients will not evolve to advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Despite this, it has been described that the hepatic disease is the third cause of death among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver, after cardiovascular and malignant diseases. Among the huge number of patients affected, the main challenge is to identify those who are at risk of developing cirrhosis or its complications and to recognize the diagnostic and treatment options. In this Guideline, endorsed by the Argentine Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the definitions, epidemiological aspects, natural history and a practical approach to possible algorithms to estimate the severity of liver disease in the individual patient are reviewed; in addition to analyzing advances in treatment and proposing recommendations for follow-up. It is important to note that no data on the incidence or prevalence of the disease have been published in the general population of Argentina, and it is encouraged to carry them out.
