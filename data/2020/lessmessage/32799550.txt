Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common lethal diseases in the world, has a 5-year survival rate of only 7%. Hepatocellular carcinoma has no symptoms in the early stage but obvious symptoms in the late stage, leading to delayed diagnosis and reduced treatment efficacy. In recent years, as the scope of HCC research has increased in depth, the clinical development and application of molecular targeted drugs and immunotherapy drugs have brought new breakthroughs in HCC treatment. Targeted therapy drugs for HCC have high specificity, allowing them to selectively kill tumor cells and minimize damage to normal tissues. At present, these targeted drugs are mainly classified into 3 categories: small molecule targeted drugs, HCC antigen-specific targeted drugs, and immune checkpoint targeted drugs. This article reviews the latest research progress on the targeted drugs for HCC.
