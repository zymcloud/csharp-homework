Multiple studies have recently and/or are presently investigating ipilimumab in combination with other drugs and follow-up survival rates in previously treated patients. It originally received FDA approval for malignant melanoma, including unresectable or metastatic melanoma. However, it has since received approval for several other malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and researchers are investigating for many more, including several genitourinary tumors, rare pancreatic tumors, gallbladder tumors, etc. It is FDA approved for use in combination with nivolumab for advanced renal cell carcinoma, for previously treated microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer, and, most recently, for hepatocellular carcinoma previously treated with sorafenib.
