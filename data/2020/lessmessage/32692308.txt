Excretory/Secretory Products (ESPs) of the nematode Trichinella spiralis contain antitumor-active substances that inhibit tumor growth. Mature dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in the antitumor immunity of the organism. As pathogen-derived products, it ought to be discussed whether T. spiralis ESPs will reduce the antitumor effect of mature DCs from the host before it is applied to patients' tumors. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the immunological effect of DCs stimulated by T. spiralis ESPs in H22 tumor-bearing mice. H22 tumor model mice in this study were randomly divided into four groups according to the treatment: PBS control group, ESP group, DCs group, and DCs stimulated with T. spiralis ESP (ESP+DCs group). The antitumor effect was evaluated by tumor inhibition rate and cytokine detection using ELISA. The results showed significant inhibition in tumor growth in the ESP+DCs, DCs and ESP groups when compared with the PBS control group (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively). However, no significant difference was observed on tumor inhibition rates between the ESP+DCs and DCs groups. The decrease in IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, and the increase in IFN-Î³ between the DCs and ESP+DCs groups were also not significant. Therefore, DCs stimulated by ESP did not reduce the antitumor effect of mature DCs, which demonstrated that the T. spiralis ESP would not affect the antitumor effect of mature DCs by modulating the immune response of the host, and that ESPs are safe in antitumor immunology when applied in a tumor model mice.
