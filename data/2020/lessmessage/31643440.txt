Pazopanib is a multi-kinase inhibitor active against vascular endothelial growth factor receptors-1, -2 and -3 that is used in the therapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcomas. Pazopanib therapy is commonly associated with transient elevations in serum aminotransferase during therapy and has been linked to rare, but occasionally severe and even fatal cases of clinically apparent acute liver injury.
