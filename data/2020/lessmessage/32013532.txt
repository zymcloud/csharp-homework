Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome is a serious complication of pregnancy. Postpartum hemorrhage indicates poor prognosis of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome. The aim of our study is to investigate the predictive value of coagulation markers for postpartum hemorrhage of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome. In a retrospective cohort study, 106 patients who were diagnosed as pregnant women with HELLP syndrome in Peking University Third Hospital from August 2010 to January 2017 were analyzed. The demographic characters of maternal and fetus, days of hospital stay, postpartum complications, and the laboratory tests of coagulation markers within 3 days before delivery were collected. In addition, 100 healthy pregnant women were collected as a control group. The result showed that the incidence of preeclampsia in pregnant women with postpartum hemorrhage was higher than that in pregnant women without hemorrhage (P = .011). The level of fibrinogen (FIB) in postpartum hemorrhage pregnant women with HELLP syndrome was lower than that in nonpostpartum hemorrhage pregnant women with HELLP syndrome and healthy pregnant women (2.3 [1.68-2.81] vs 3.64 ± 0.95, P = .000; 2.3 [1.68-2.81] vs 4.48 ± 0.62, P = .000). Multivariate analysis showed that decreased FIB levels independently predicted the postpartum hemorrhage of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome (odds ratio = 7.374, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.551-35.05, P = .012). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the area under the curve of FIB level when predicting postpartum hemorrhage is 0.841 (95% CI, 0.708-0.976). When the cutoff value of FIB was 3.04 g/L, the sensitivity was 90.90% and the specificity was75.80%. Therefore, the low level of prenatal FIB is a reliable biomarker to predict postpartum hemorrhage of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome, which make it useful for pregnant women with HELLP syndrome in guiding surveillance therapy and prognosis assessment.
