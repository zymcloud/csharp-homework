Liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma is considered to be the third leading cause of death among all other cancers. The rate of liver cancer occurrence is high, and the rate of recovery is low. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of vicenin-2 against the diethylnitrosamine-induced liver carcinoma in experimental rats. Diethylnitrosamine was widely employed as a carcinogenic agent to stimulate the cancer in animal models. Our results indicated that vicenin-2 administration effectively attenuates the diethylnitrosamine-induced physiological and pharmacological alterations in the experimental rats. Vicenin-2 treatment significantly enhanced the pathological lesions and decreased the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) in serum. We also observed that vicenin-2 reduced the production of reactive oxygen species, decreased the liver weight, upregulated expression of apoptotic proteins, and decreased the histological changes in the liver, which are induced by the diethylnitrosamine in rats. Moreover, vicenin-2 downregulates antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and upregulates the proapoptotic Bax and caspase. Hence, our results suggested that vicenin-2 had a highly therapeutic effect in reversing diethylnitrosamine-induced liver carcinoma in rats, which might be related to the apoptosis induced by vicenin-2. Therefore vicenin-2 could be a good candidate for future therapeutic use to inhibit chemically induced liver cancer.
