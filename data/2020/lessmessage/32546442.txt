Introduction and objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most lethal cancer around the world, with poor survival rate and high metastasis rate in patients. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to modulate the initiation and development of liver cancer. We aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA MAGI2-AS3 in HCC and underlying mechanisms.Materials and methods:The expression levels of MAGI2-AS3 in plasma of HCC patients and the control participants were measured by qPCR. Hep3B and MHCC97-H cells were transfected with MAGI2-AS3 and ROCK2 expression vectors. Cell migration and invasion of HCC cells transfected with the vectors were investigated by transwell assay. In addition, flow cytometry and western blot were performed for apoptosis detection.Results:We found that MAGI2-AS3 was downregulated in plasma of early stage HCC patients compared to healthy controls. After surgical resection, the expression levels of MAGI2-AS3 were increased compared to pretreatment levels on the day of discharge. During the follow-up, MAGI2-AS3 was downregulated in patients developed distant recurrence, but not in other patients compared to the levels measured on the day of discharge. In HCC cells, overexpression of MAGI2-AS3 mediated the downregulation of ROCK2. Cell invasion and migration assay showed that overexpression of MAGI2-AS3 mediated the decreased cell invasion and migration rate, while ROCK2 played an opposite role and attenuated the effects of overexpression of MAGI2-AS3.Conclusion:Our study indicated that MAGI2-AS3 was downregulated in the distant recurrence of HCC after surgical resection and affected the invasion and migration of HCC cells via ROCK2.
