Mallory bodies (MB), also known as Mallory-Denk bodies (MDB), are cytoplasmic hyaline inclusions of hepatocytes, once thought to be specific for alcoholic hepatitis now occur in other liver diseases which include nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cholestatic liver diseases, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In 1911, Frank Burr Mallory (1862-1941) discovered these bodies while examining the hepatocytes of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. In 1975, Helmut Denk found the first animal model of Mallory bodies by feeding mice griseofulvin, which allowed further research on Mallory bodies resulted in the renaming to Mallory-Denk bodies (MDB).
