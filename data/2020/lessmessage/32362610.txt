Objective:The objective of this study is to review the multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) findings of synchronous lymphoma and other solid malignancies.Patients and methods:This retrospective study included 18 patients confirmed with diagnosis of lymphoma and other solid malignancies. They were 8 women and 10 men (mean age, 62.5 year; range, 44-73 years). CT scanning was performed on one of the two systems: 64 MDCT in 11 patients and 6 MDCT in 7 patients. All 36 malignancies were underwent pathological evaluation.Results:All cases were confirmed pathologically. Lymphomas were Hodgkin disease ( n = 5 patients) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( n = 13 patients). Hepatocellular carcinoma was detected in five patients. Bronchogenic carcinoma was detected in two patients. Renal cell carcinoma was detected in two patients. Breast carcinoma was detected in two patients. Prostatic carcinoma was detected in two patients. Gastric carcinoma was detected in two patients. Endometrial carcinoma was detected in one patient. Colonic carcinoma was detected in one patient. Thyroid carcinoma was detected in one patient.Conclusions:MDCT scanning is accurately imaging modality for the evaluation of synchronous lymphoma and other solid malignancies. More reports and accumulation of such cases should help to clarify the mechanisms, contribute to a further understanding of this phenomenon, and may lead to a new treatment strategy for synchronous lymphoma and other solid malignancies.
