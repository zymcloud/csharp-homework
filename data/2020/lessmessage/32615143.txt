The liver is the key organ involved in lipid metabolism and transport. Excessive lipid accumulation due to dysregulated lipid metabolism predisposes the liver to steatosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Lipids are generally compartmentalized in specialized organelles called lipid droplets that enable cells to store and release lipids in a regulated manner. However, during flux-in and flux-out of droplets, lipids are converted into toxic species leading to lipid-mediated liver damage. Lipids are categorized into 'toxic' or 'healthy' lipids that are involved in liver disease pathogenesis or resolution, respectively. Lipidomic analysis have revealed unique lipid signature that correlates with the disease progression therefore being used for disease diagnosis. In this comprehensive review, we provide an overview on hepatic lipid homeostasis, lipid compartmentalization mechanisms and lipidomic profiles in different liver diseases. We further discuss promising therapeutics targeting the hepatic lipidome including pro-resolving lipids, liposomes, and small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of liver diseases.
