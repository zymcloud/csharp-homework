Purpose: To evaluate whether 'invisible' liver tumors on CT can be treated by stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) using fusion of pre-ablation MRI.Methods: In this retrospective case-control study, 60 patients (14 with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 46 with metastatic liver tumors) with CT 'invisible' lesions underwent SRFA using MRI-fusion between June 2005 and June 2018 ('fusion group'). For comparison, 60 patients who underwent SRFA without image fusion were selected using nearest neighbor propensity score matching ('control group'). Endpoints consisted of local tumor control, safety, overall and disease-free survival.Results: Major complications occurred in 6/69 ablations (8.7%) in the fusion group and in 6/89 ablations (6.7%) in the control group (p = 0.434). Primary technical efficacy rate (i.e., successful initial ablation) was 96.6% (28/29) for HCC and 97.9% (166/170) for metastatic disease in the fusion group and 100% (33/33) and 93.3% (184/194) in the control group, respectively (p = 0.468 and 0.064). Local recurrence (LR) was observed in 1/29 (3.5%) HCCs and in 6/170 metastases (4.0%) in the fusion group and 1/33 (3.0%) and 21/196 (10.7%) in the control group, respectively. The LR rate of metastasis in the control group was significantly higher (p = 0.007), although differences in OS and DFS did not reach statistical significance.Conclusions: Image fusion using pre-procedural MRI allows for ablation of CT-'invisible' liver tumors that are otherwise untreatable. Moreover, local oncological control was higher in metastatic liver tumors versus matched controls which suggests it could be useful tool for all stereotactic radiofrequency ablation procedures.
