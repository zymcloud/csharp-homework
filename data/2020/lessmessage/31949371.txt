Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a glycosylated type-II transmembrane protein highly expressed in certain tumor cells. It has emerged as a novel radiotracer for evaluation of prostate cancer. Increased PSMA expression in isolated liver lesion is a diagnostic challenge. Solitary liver metastasis from prostate cancer is rare. On the other hand, PSMA avid primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported in literature. We report a case of PSMA expressing atypical HCC with normal alphafeto protein (AFP) and raised prostate specific antigen (PSA).
