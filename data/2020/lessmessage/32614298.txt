The invasion of the inferior vena cava (IVCI) due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an unusual but aggressive entity. When it hap pens, the disease is considered to be in a very advanced stage, and the proposed treatment is palliative chemotherapy. However, there are recent studies that support radical surgical treatment as a therapeutic option, so their results show longer survivals than chemotherapy without major surgical complications. We present the clinical case of a patient with HCC and IVCI treated by hepatic resection and inferior vena cava (IVC) replacement with disease-free survival of 8 months after surgery.
