Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows a rising incidence and mortality rates worldwide. HCC is divided into several distinct subtypes, both morphologically and histopathologically. Among these subtypes, infiltrative HCC may be the most challenging subtype to diagnose, given its characteristic myriad of tumor nodules blended with normal hepatocytes without a distinct mass-like lesion. Herein, we report an unusual case of an infiltrative HCC initially presenting with isolated malignant portal vein thrombosis and provide a brief review of the literature regarding the infiltrative HCC subtype. Additionally, we demonstrate how sonoelastography could aid in detecting the appropriate biopsy area in the infiltrative HCC subtype. To our knowledge, there have not been previously reported cases describing the use of sonoelastography in the evaluation of the appropriate area for the targeted liver biopsy.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows a rising incidence and mortality rates worldwide.
