Existing reports have demonstrated that miR-199a-3p plays a role as a tumor suppressor in a variety of human cancers. This study aims to further validate the expression of miR-199a-3p in HCC and to explore its underlying mechanisms by using multiple data sets. Chip data or sequencing data and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were integrated to assess the expression of miR-199a-3p in HCC. The potential targets and transcription factor regulatory network of miR-199a-3p in HCC were determined and possible biological mechanism of miR-199a-3p was analyzed with bioinformatics methods. In the results, miR-199a-3p expression was significantly lower in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues according to chip data or sequencing data and qRT-PCR. Moreover, 455 targets of miR-199a-3p were confirmed, and these genes were involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, and focal adhesions. LAMA4 was considered a key target of miR-199a-3p. In CMTCN, 11 co-regulatory pairs, 3 TF-FFLs, and 2 composite-FFLs were constructed. In conclusion, miR-199a-3p was down regulated in HCC and LAMA4 may be a potential target of miR-199a-3p in HCC.
