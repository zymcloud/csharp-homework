Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) includes a variety of changes including nonalcoholic fatty liver, cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), which are associated with metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is complex and multifactorial. Many studies have shown that estrogen has a protective effect on premenopausal women with metabolic disorders and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Estrogen supplements may, at least in theory, prevent the development and progression of NAFLD. Phytoestrogen is extracted from plants, especially legumes, whose molecular structure and biological activity are similar to those of mammals estrogen, therefore it could replace the role of estrogen and prevent the occurrence of adverse reactions to estrogen. In this article, we review the published literature related to phytoestrogens and NAFLD as well as suggest the possible mechanisms that may underlie the association between phytoestrogens and NAFLD.
