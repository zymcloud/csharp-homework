Purpose:Oral cancer is one among the devastating types of malignancies and imposes tremendous disease burden on humans. This study was undertaken to investigate the anticancer properties of a plant-derived flavanone, Blumeatin, against human oral cancer cells. Additionally, this study also attempted to unreveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anticancer properties of this molecule.Methods:MTT assay was used for the assessment of cell viability. Transwell and wound healing assays were used for the determination of cell invasion and migration, respectively. Comet assay was used for the determination of cell viability. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was done to assess the induction of autophagy. The protein expression was determined by western blot analysis.Results:Blumeatin inhibited the growth of SCC-4 oral cancer cells with minimal cytotoxic effects against the normal hTRET-OME cells. The flow cytometric analysis showed that Blumeatin triggers DNA damage in the SCC-4 cells. Blumeatin also activated autophagy in SCC-4 cells which was accompanied with upregulation of LC3B and Beclin 1. This molecule also increased ROS and decreased the MMP levels in human SCC-4 cells. The effects of Blumeatin were also examined on the migration and invasion of the SCC-4 cells and it was revealed that the molecule suppresses both migration and invasion of the SCC-4 oral cancer cells.Conclusion:This study indicates that Blumeatin exhibits potent anticancer effects and points towards its use in the development of a new systemic therapy for oral cancer.
