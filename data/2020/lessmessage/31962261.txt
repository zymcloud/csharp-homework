Introduction:Acute hemoperitoneum with a spontaneously ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rare type of internal bleeding that requires a multidisciplinary management approach.Presentation of case:In this case report, we describe a fortuitously ruptured peripheral and discovered HCC in an 81-years-old woman treated effectively using hepatectomy.Discussion:The use of the computed tomography (CT) angiography to diagnose the stability of the patient's condition allows both arterial embolization in case of active bleeding and the evaluation of the underlying hepatopathy. The place of surgery is particularly upon after both the failure of arterial embolization and while facing a severe hemodynamic instability. The surgical strategy varies between perihepatic tamponnade and a surgical resection in one or more stages. The prognosis of a ruptured HCC depends mainly on the underlying liver's function.Conclusion:Multidisciplinary management of spontaneously ruptured HCC results in the same survival outcome as non-ruptured HCC at the same stage of hepatopathy.
