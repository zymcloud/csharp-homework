Aims:The goal of this study was to analyze the puncture routes of imaging-guided thermal ablation for tumors of the hepatic caudate lobe.Materials and methods:The imaging-guided thermal ablation puncture routes of 12 cases of hepatic caudate lobe tumors were collected in our hospital from January 2013 to February 2019. The puncture routes were retrospectively analyzed, and the experience of thermal ablation therapy for hepatic caudate lobe tumors was summarized.Results:Among the 12 cases of hepatic caudate lobe tumors, puncture routes were divided into the anterior (through the left lobe of the liver) approach (six cases), the right hepatic approach (five cases), and the transthoracic approach (one case). Different ablation electrodes were selected according to the puncture route and method of guiding. No serious postoperative complications were noted.Conclusion:The hepatic caudate lobe is surrounded by the inferior vena cava, hepatic vein, and hepatic hilum, leading to great difficulties and risks in performing minimally invasive treatment of hepatic caudate lobe malignancies. Therefore, selecting an appropriate puncture route is an important factor in the success of the treatment.
