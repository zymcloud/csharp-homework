Introduction and objectives:Analysis of cancer biomarkers is an important tool in developing targeted-therapy and in modulating chemoresistance. Here, we analyze the relevance of CD90, a marker of cancer stem cells (CSC) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its correlation with autophagy.Materials and methods:For in vivo study, 86 specimens were collected from 43 patients undergoing liver resections. In each patient, HCC nodule (HCC) and surrounding non-tumor (SNT) were collected. For in vitro study, HCC cells JHH6 subpopulations expressing CD90+ and CD90- were isolated using magnetic-sorter and confirmed by flow-cytometry. Upon doxorubicin treatment, autophagy turn-over was analyzed by RTqPCR for mRNA expression, Western blot for protein expression, and autophagosome staining for autophagy-flux. Cytotoxicity test was performed by MTT assay. Gene and protein analysis were performed in clinical samples together with immunohistostaining.Results:CD90 mRNA expression was higher in HCC than in SNT for 8-fold (p Conclusions:We demonstrated the relevance of differential autophagy capacity of CD90+ cells in HCC. Autophagy was involved in cancer-defense mechanism against doxorubicin. Cancer promoting function of autophagy in CD90+ cells was also related to cancer environment.
