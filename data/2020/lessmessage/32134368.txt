Background:Based on the biological significance of hederagenin-type saponins found in our previous investigation, a series of new hederagenin derivatives were designed and synthesized.Methods:Their in vitro antiproliferative activities were evaluated against the HepG2 liver cancer cell line and normal cell line L929 by MTT assay.Results:The preliminary bioassay results demonstrated that all the tested compounds 1-7 showed potent anti-hepatoma activities, and some compounds exhibited better effects than 5-fluorouracil against human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell line. Furthermore, compound 5 showed a significant antihepatoma activity against HepG2 cells with an IC50 value of 1.88 ÂµM. Besides, all of the tested compounds showed a low cytotoxic effect against the normal cell line L929.Conclusion:All the compounds 1-7 displayed superior selectivity against human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell line, and the results suggest that the structural modifications of C ring on the hederagenin backbone are vital for modulating anti-hepatoma activities.
