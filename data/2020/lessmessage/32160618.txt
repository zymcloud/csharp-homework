Introduction:Hepatoid adenocarcinoma (AC) of the stomach (HAS) represents a rare variant of conventional gastric AC characterised by poor prognosis. They are usually managed with surgery (localised disease) and chemotherapy.Case report:We present the first case report of a patient with HAS who presented with weight loss, poor appetite, general clinical deterioration (performance status [PS] = 3), and active gastrointestinal bleeding who was treated with fractionated palliative radiotherapy (RT) using 30 Gy in 10 fractions. The use of RT was associated with excellent symptomatic and radiological response and facilitated surgery secondary to significant improvement in general fitness and PS.Conclusion:RT may have a role in the multimodality management of hepatoid AC of the stomach.
