Objectives:Analysis of tumor immune infiltration has been suggested to outperform tumor, node, metastasis staging in predicting clinical course of colorectal cancer (CRC). Infiltration by cells expressing OX40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, or CD16, expressed by natural killer cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells, has been associated with favorable prognosis in patients with CRC. We hypothesized that assessment of CRC infiltration by both OX40+ and CD16+ cells might result in enhanced prognostic significance.Methods:Colorectal cancer infiltration by OX40 and CD16 expressing cells was investigated in 441 primary CRCs using tissue microarrays and specific antibodies, by immunohistochemistry. Patients' survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. Multivariate Cox regression analysis, hazard ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were also used to evaluate prognostic significance of OX40+ and CD16+ cell infiltration.Results:Colorectal cancer infiltration by OX40+ and CD16+ cells was subclassified into 4 groups with high or low infiltration levels in all possible combinations. High levels of infiltration by both OX40+ and CD16+ cells were associated with lower pT stage, absence of peritumoral lymphocytic (PTL) inflammation, and a positive prognostic impact. Patients bearing tumors with high infiltration by CD16+ and OX40+ cells were also characterized by significantly longer overall survival, as compared with the other groups. These results were confirmed by analyzing an independent validation cohort.Conclusions:Combined infiltration by OX40+ and CD16+ immune cells is an independent favorable prognostic marker in CRC. The prognostic value of CD16+ immune cell infiltration is significantly improved by the combined analysis with OX40+ cell infiltration.
