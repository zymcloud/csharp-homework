Purpose:To explore a new therapeutic option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the efficacy and safety of a group of traditional Chinese medicines (Banxia XieXin recipe) as monotherapy for patients with advanced HCC was studied.Materials and methods:The study included 68 patients with advanced HCC from August 16,2016 to August 15,2019 for analysis. These eligible patients received treatment with Banxia XieXin recipe for at least 1 month. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). In addition, safety was also assessed.Results:The median treatment duration of these 68 patients was 10.3 months (range = 1.6-33.5 months), and follow-up is still ongoing. The median PFS was 6.07 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.748-8.392 months), and the median OS was 12.60 months (95% CI = 8.019-17.181 months). The ORR was 10.3% and the DCR was 41.2%. In the subgroup analysis, the median OS in the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) group was not reached, and the median OS in the NO TACE group was 11.30 months (95% CI = 3.219-19.381 months). In addition, no drug-related serious adverse events were observed during the study.Conclusion:This is the first clinical analysis of traditional Chinese medicine as a single treatment for advanced HCC. The obtained results are encouraging as they suggest that this panel of Chinese herbs is safe and it may be effective for patients with advanced HCC in a real-world clinical setting.
