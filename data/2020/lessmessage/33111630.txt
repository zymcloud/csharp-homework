Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most aggressive type of gastrointestinal tumor, with a high rate of mortality. However, identifying biomarkers for the treatment of HCC remains to be developed. We aimed to determine whether cell division cycle 25C (CDC25C) could be used as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker in HCC. Expression of CDC25C in HCC was analyzed by using GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) and UALCAN databases. GEPIA and CBioPortal databases were applied to analyze patients'survival and CDC25C mutations, respectively. PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction) network was further built by STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes) and Metascape Web portals. To the best of our knowledge, the novel observations identified in the present study reveal that the expression of CDC25C in HCC was significantly enhanced when compare to that in normal liver tissues (P
