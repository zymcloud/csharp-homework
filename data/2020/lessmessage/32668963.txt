4-acetylantrocamol LT3 (4AALT3), a new ubiquinone from the mycelium of Antrodia cinnamomea (Polyporaceae), has been recently shown to possess anticancer activity. However, the detailed mechanisms of such action remain unclear. In this study, the molecular mechanisms of 4AALT3 on hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) were investigated. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 cells were treated with concentrations of 4AALT3. Cell viability, colony formation, and the underlying mechanisms were then analyzed by CCK-8, colony formation, qPCR, and Western blotting assays. We found that 4AALT3 significantly decreased cell viability and colony formation in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, 4AALT3 significantly decreased protein levels of cyclin B, E1, D1, and D3, thereby facilitating cell cycle arrest. In addition, 4AALT3 significantly suppressed the nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and WNT/[Formula: see text]-catenin signaling pathways, all of which are well-known signaling pathways that contribute to the malignant properties of HCC. These effects are associated with activation of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and autophagy. Our findings indicate that 4AALT3 exerts inhibitory effects on HepG2 cell growth via multiple signaling pathways and may be a potential agent for HCC therapy.
