Ovaries are a common niche for metastasis. Metastatic malignancies account for 5-30% of all ovarian malignancies. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the rare malignancies to metastasize to the ovaries. Of all the variants of HCC, fibrolamellar HCC (FLHCC) variant is extremely uncommon and accounts for around 1% of all HCC cases. FLHCC metastasizing to ovaries, at presentation, is an exceptional occurrence. We present a case of a young female who presented with bilateral adnexal masses and was diagnosed as metastatic FLHCC on histopathological examination and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, a thorough literature review highlighting the previously reported cases is also presented.
