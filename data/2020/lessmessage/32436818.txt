Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing cause of chronic liver diseases worldwide, involving about 25% of people. NAFLD incorporates a large spectrum of pathological conditions, from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and its complications include hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This progression occurs, over many years, in an asymptomatic way, until advanced fibrosis appears. Thus, the differentiation of NASH from simple steatosis and identification of advanced hepatic fibrosis are key issues. To date, the histological assessment of fibrosis with liver biopsy is the gold standard, but obviously, invasiveness is the greater threshold. In addition, rare but potentially life-threatening complications, poor acceptability, sampling variability and cost maybe restrict its use. Furthermore, due to the epidemic of NAFLD worldwide and several limitations of liver biopsy evaluation, noninvasive assessment tools to detect fibrosis in NAFLD patients are needed.
