Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains to be a serious threat to public health and is associated with many liver diseases including chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) and pegylated interferon-α (Peg-IFNα) have been confirmed to be efficient in inhibiting HBV replication, it is difficult to eradicate HBV and achieve the clinical cure of CHB. Therefore, long-term therapy has been recommended to CHB treatment under the current antiviral therapy. In this context, the new antiviral therapy targeting one or multiple critical steps of viral life cycle may be an alternative approach in future. In the last decade, the functional receptor [sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP)] of HBV entry into hepatocytes has been discovered, and the immature nucleocapsids containing the non- or partially reverse-transcribed pregenomic RNA, the nucleocapsids containing double-strand linear DNA (dslDNA), and the empty particles devoid of any HBV nucleic acid have been found to be released into circulation, which have supplemented the life cycle of HBV. The understanding of HBV life cycle may offer a new instruction for searching the potential antiviral targets, and the new viral markers used to monitor the efficacy of antiviral therapy for CHB patients in the future.
