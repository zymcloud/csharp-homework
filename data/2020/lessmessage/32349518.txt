Cinobufagin is a Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) inhibitor with excellent anticancer effects to prolong the survival of patients. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the underlying mechanism of the anticancer effects of cinobufagin using overexpression or inhibition of aurora kinase A (AURKA) signaling. First, high expression of Na+/K+-ATPase alpha 1 subunit (ATP1A1) and AURAK resulted in increased malignant transformation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data and tissue samples. After treatment with cinobufagin, we successfully screened 202, 249, and 335 changing expression proteins in Huh-7 cells under normal, overexpression, and inhibition of AURKA using tandem mass tags (TMT)-labeled quantitative proteomics coupled to 2D liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these molecules were closely associated with chromosome segregation, DNA damage, and regulation of translation processes. We further confirmed that cinobufagin induced DNA damage and chromosome segregation disorders and suppresses translational processing in oncogenes by decreasing the expression of AURKA, mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), p-mTOR, p-extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and p-eIF4E, while increasing the expression of p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (S65, T37, T46, T45) and increasing the interaction between eIF4 and 4E-BP1. Our results suggested that cinobufagin performed an antitumor effects in liver cancer cells by inhibiting the AURKA-mTOR-eIF4E axis.
