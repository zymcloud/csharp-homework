Background and objective:Chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma are mainly caused by hepatitis C infection. It is a worldwide predominant pathogen and is one of the main causes of healthcare problem in Asia. In the last few decades, there has been a considerable change in the treatment regimen for hepatitis C virus. The objective of this research was to relate the treatment response with sustained viral response in various therapies which have been the standard of care from time to time.Materials and methods:This hospital-based, retrospective-cum-prospective research span over a period of 2 years; we enrolled hepatitis C patients who attended the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Government Medical College, Srinagar, since June 2015 till May 2017. Subsequently, the database was prepared, containing all the relevant information about these patients.Conclusions:(i) In retrospective group: The overall efficacy (sustained viral response at 24 weeks [SVR-24]) of pegylated interferon a2a and ribavirin regimen was 90.96%. (ii) In prospective group: The efficacy (SVR) of different regimens was found to be as: sofosbuvir + ribavirin + daclatasvir (SVR-24, 83.33%); sofosbuvir + ribavirin (SVR-12, 94.57%); and sofosbuvir + daclatasvir (SVR-12, 98.00%).
