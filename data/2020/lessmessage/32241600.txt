We aimed to examine and characterize the 100 most-cited published articles in the field of hepatology.Patients and methods:A comprehensive list of the 100 most-cited articles published from 1950 to 2017 in the field of hepatology was compiled after searching the Web of Science with relevant terms, including "liver," "hepatitis," "hepatic," "hepatocellular," "hepatology," "cirrhosis," and "steatohepatitis." The articles were ranked according to their citation counts and were evaluated for characteristics including country, institution, authorship, publication year, subspecialty and others.Results:The database search returned 323,291 articles associated with liver disease published between 1950 and 2017. The 100 most-cited articles were from 21 major journals, with the highest number of articles being published in Hepatology (n=20). The average number of citations of the 100 most-cited articles was 1946.8; among these articles, the most frequently cited article received 5515 citations, and the least frequently cited article received 1155 citations. In total, 60 were original articles among the 100 most-cited articles. The most frequently represented specialties were hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which accounted for 53.3%, 23.3%, and 11.7% of these articles, respectively.Discussion:Our study identified citation classics and provided a review of the most advanced studies in the field of hepatology. This can help to guide clinical treatment and future academic research resulting in advancements in hepatology.
