Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of cancer and results in a high mortality rate worldwide. Unfortunately, most cases of HCC are diagnosed in an advanced stage, resulting in a poor prognosis and ineffective treatment. HCC is often resistant to both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, resulting in a high recurrence rate. Although the use of stem cells is evolving into a potentially effective approach for the treatment of cancer, few studies on stem cell therapy in HCC have been published. The administration of stem cells from bone marrow, adipose tissue, the amnion, and the umbilical cord to experimental animal models of HCC has not yielded consistent responses. However, it is possible to induce the apoptosis of cancer cells, repress angiogenesis, and cause tumor regression by administration of genetically modified stem cells. New alternative approaches to cancer therapy, such as the use of stem cell derivatives, exosomes or stem cell extracts, have been proposed. In this review, we highlight these experimental approaches for the use of stem cells as a vehicle for local drug delivery.
