Background/aim:Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study assessed the epigenomic changes in hepatoma-derived cells through HDGF stimulation.Materials and methods:We used two hepatoma-derived cell lines (HepG2 and SK-Hep1) and searched for microRNAs whose expression commonly changed in response to HDGF administration. We further explored a genetic database to investigate the association of the candidate microRNAs with the survival of HCC patients.Results:Despite both HepG2 and SK-Hep1 cells being categorized as hepatoma-derived cells, the microRNA profile differed between these two lines. However, HepG2 and SK-Hep1 cells shared 30 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated microRNAs. Of these, miR-6072 and miR-3137 were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in HCC patients.Conclusion:We identified two candidate microRNAs whose expression increased in response to HDGF stimulation. Both these molecules were associated with a poor prognosis of HCC patients.
