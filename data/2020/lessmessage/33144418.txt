Background/aim:Surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI) is used to establish patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) and other orthotopic mouse models. Orthotopic liver models can be challenging, as the liver parenchyma is prone to bleeding. The present report describes a sutureless method to implant tumors in the liver that reduces bleeding and procedural time.Materials and methods:Human HCC cell-line (Huh-7-GFP) and CM2, a patient-derived colon-cancer liver metastasis, were used for sutureless SOI of tumor fragments in the liver of nude mice. A small cavity was formed on the liver surface. A solitary tumor fragment was implanted in the cavity without suturing to create hemostasis.Results:Six weeks after sutureless SOI, the tumor volume of Huh-7-GFP (n=5) was 584.41±147.64 mm3 and the tumor volume of CM2 (n=5) was 1336.54±1038.20 mm3 The engraftment rate was 100%.Conclusion:This novel method for establishing orthotopic liver-implantation mouse models is suitable for studies of liver cancer and liver metastases due to its simple procedure and potential high engraftment rate.
