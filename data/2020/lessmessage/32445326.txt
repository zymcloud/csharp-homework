Intra-abdominal bronchogenic cysts are rare entities and only a handful of cases occurring within the lesser sac have been described. Further, the development of malignancy in a bronchogenic cyst is exceptional and one arising in a lesser sac has so far not been reported. We present herein an account of a 44-year-old man who presented with recurrent upper abdominal pain. Investigations revealed a mass in the lesser sac and a hydatid cyst in the liver. The histopathological examination of the excised mass showed bronchogenic cyst, with a neuroendocrine tumor of intermediate grade arising in its wall. Concomitant presence of hydatid cyst in the liver made this case even more unusual.
