Objective:To compare the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and liver-cancer-specific survival (LCSS) of elderly (≥65 years) and younger patients (Materials and methods:From January 2002 to December 2017, 510 elderly and 1053 younger patients were diagnosed with early-stage HCC according to the Milan criteria. All of these patients were treatment-naïve to US-PMMA. Baseline characteristics were collected to identify any risk factors to determine the survival outcomes. OS, DFS, and LCSS probabilities were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the Log-rank test.Results:Complete ablation was achieved in all patients. Elderly patients were more likely to be, hepatitis C virus infection, comorbidities, cirrhosis, larger tumors, poor liver functional reservation, more ablation points, longer ablation time, longer hospital stays, and higher hospitalization costs (P Conclusions:Although advanced age and comorbidities are intrinsic factors in elderly HCC patients, similar survival outcomes were obtained in elderly and younger HCC patients treated by US-PMWA, despite elderly patients having more comorbidities.
