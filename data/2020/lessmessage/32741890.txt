Objective Although most patients who obtain a sustained virological response (SVR) show an improved liver function, some show decreased platelet counts after the eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV). The aim of this retrospective study was to clarify the association of the liver and spleen volumes with the platelet count after SVR achieved by direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. Methods This study enrolled 36 consecutive patients treated by DAAs who obtained an SVR between September 2014 and December 2018. The liver and spleen volumes were derived from computed tomography scans obtained at pretreatment, SVR, and 48 weeks after SVR. No patient developed hepatocellular carcinoma during this study. Results Compared with pretreatment, the median aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, albumin serum levels, and platelet counts were significantly improved at SVR and 48 weeks after SVR. The liver/spleen volumes per body weight had decreased significantly from 22.5/4.2 mL/kg at baseline to 21.1/3.6 mL/kg at 48 weeks after SVR. The change in the liver volume was associated with the change in the platelet count, and the change in the spleen volume was negatively associated with the change in the serum albumin level. A multivariate analysis identified the change in the liver volume (â‰¥95%, odds ratio 76.9, p=0.005) as the factor associated with improvement in the platelet count at 48 weeks after SVR. The patients with an increased liver volume at 48 weeks after SVR showed an increased platelet count. Conclusion Both the liver and spleen volume decreased significantly after the eradication of HCV. The patients with a re-increased liver volume showed a rapid increase in the platelet count.
