Objective Rifaximin has become available for treating hyperammonemia in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. This study analyzed the changes in the body composition and nutritional status after long-term rifaximin therapy. Methods Twenty-one patients who underwent rifaximin therapy at 1,200 mg/day for more than 24 weeks were evaluated for the changes in the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) scores for the nutritional assessment, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) scores for the liver function assessment, and skeletal muscle index (SMI) for the body composition assessment. Results There were 17 men and 4 women, with a mean age of 67.14±8.32 years. Eleven cases had a portosystemic shunt (52.3%), and 10 had hepatocellular carcinoma (47.6%). The Child-Pugh class was A in 9 cases (42.9%), B in 9 cases (42.9%), and C in 3 cases (14.2%). The blood ammonia levels in the rifaximin group improved significantly upon rifaximin therapy, from 124.76±28.68 μg/dL at baseline to 47.00±14.43 μg/dL after 2 weeks (p
