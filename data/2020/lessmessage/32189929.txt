Aim:The aim of this study was to study the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in monitoring hepatic fat content in cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Materials and methods:41 adults (mean age: 39 years, 22 males; 19 females) with NAFLD were included after obtaining approval from the institutional ethics committee. The baseline clinical (weight, body mass index [BMI]) and biochemical parameters, fatty liver grade on ultrasonography (USG), and hepatic fat signal fraction (FSF) using dual-echo chemical shift imaging and proton density fat fraction on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS-PDFF) were assessed, before and after intervention (dietary and lifestyle changes and oral vitamin E for six months). They were categorized into Group A (good compliance to intervention) and Group B (poor compliance), and the clinical and imaging parameters were compared between them.Results:After intervention, Group A (n = 30) showed significant reduction in BMI (28.35 ± 3.25 to 27.14 ± 3.24 kg/m2; P < 0.001), hepatic FSF (19.30 ± 9.09% to 11.18 ± 7.61%; P < 0.05), and MRS-PDFF (18.79 ± 8.53% to 10.64 ± 6.66%). In Group B (n = 11), there was significant increase in BMI (28.85 ± 2.41 to 29.31 ± 2.57 kg/m2; P < 0.001), hepatic FSF (18.96 ± 9.79% to 21.48 ± 11.80%; P < 0.05), and reduction in high-density lipoproteins (P < 0.05). Although there was good correlation between USG and MRS in quantifying liver fat (r = 0.84-0.87; P < 0.001), USG was unable to detect <5.3% change in hepatic fat. There was poor correlation between lipid profile and MRS-PDFF. Change in body weight significantly correlated with change in hepatic fat content (r = 0.76; P < 0.001).Conclusion:MRI is useful in accurately quantifying and in monitoring hepatic fat content and is better than clinical and biochemical parameters and USG.
