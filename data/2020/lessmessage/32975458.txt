Aim:Evidence has provided an explanation of the correlation between the nervous system and the tumor microenvironment. Neurotransmitters may be involved in different aspects of cancer progression. The glycoalkaloid solanine has been reported to suppress neural signaling pathways and exists in numerous plants, including Solanum nigrum, which have been demonstrated to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.Methods:We evaluated the potentials of solanine on inhibiting acetylcholine-induced cell proliferation and migration in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Results:The results indicated that solanine markedly attenuated cell proliferation and migration via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and matrix metalloproteinases in acetylcholine-treated Hep G2 cells. In addition, exosomes derived from acetylcholine-treated Hep G2 cells were isolated, and solanine showed inhibiting effects of extrahepatic metastasis on blocking cell proliferation in exosome-treated A549 lung carcinoma cells through regulating microRNA-21 expression.Conclusion:Solanine has strong potential for application in integrative cancer therapy.
