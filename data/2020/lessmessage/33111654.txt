Background:Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) has been found to be an effective method for delivering microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs). The current study is aimed at discovering the potential anti-cancer effects of UTMD-mediated miR-206 on HCC.Methods:In our study, the expressions of miR-206 and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) in HCC tissues and cells were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). PPIB expressions in HCC and adjacent normal tissues were analyzed by gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA). MiR-206 mimic and mimic control were transfected into HCC cells using UTMD. Potential binding sites between miR-206 and PPIB were predicted and confirmed by TargetScan and dual-luciferase reporter assay, respectively. Cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis were detected by wound healing assay, Transwell, and flow cytometry, respectively. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2), Epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Snail) and PPIB were measured by Western blot.Results:MiR-206 expression was downregulated while PPIB expression was upregulated in HCC, and PPIB was recognized as a target gene of miR-206 in HCC tissues. UTMD-mediated miR-206 inhibited HCC cell migration and invasion while promoting apoptosis via regulating the expressions of proteins related to apoptosis, migration, and invasion by targeting PPIB.Conclusion:Our results suggested that the delivery of UTMD-mediated miR-206 could be a potential therapeutic method for HCC treatment, given its effects on inhibiting cell migration and invasion and promoting cell apoptosis.
