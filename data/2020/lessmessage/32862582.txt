Purpose:To uncover the role of LINC01980 in aggravating the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via targeting caspase 9.Methods:The expression levels of LINC01980 and caspase 9 in HCC tissues and paracancer tissues were determined by qRT-PCR. The prognostic potentials of LINC01980 and caspase 9 in HCC were assessed by Kaplan-Meier method. The regulatory effects of LINC01980 and caspase 9 on the viability, clonality and apoptosis of Huh7 and Hep3B cells were examined. Finally, the interaction between LINC01980 and caspase 9 was evaluated by performing dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and rescue experiments.Results:LINC01980 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. High level of LINC01980 indicated worse prognosis in HCC patients. Knockdown of LINC01980 could attenuate viability and clonality, but induced apoptosis in Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Caspase 9 was downregulated in HCC, and its high level predicted a better prognosis in HCC patients. Overexpression of caspase 9 achieved the same regulatory effects as LINC01980 knockdown on HCC cells. Caspase 9 was the downstream target for LINC01980, and its level was negatively regulated by LINC01980. In HCC, LINC01980 regulated HCC cell behaviors by downregulating caspase 9.Conclusions:Upregulation of LINC01980 in HCC predicts a poor prognosis. LINC01980 aggravates the progression of HCC via downregulating caspase 9.
