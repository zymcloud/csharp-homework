B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) is one of the common lymphoproliferative disorders with an increased risk of developing subsequent neoplasms of epithelial and mesenchymal origin. The decreased immunity and B-cell dysfunction in CLL probably accounts for this emergence of secondary malignancy. Breast, brain, skin and prostate tumors have been reported as usual coincident malignancies of CLL, while in occasional cases CLL may occur with malignancies of other solid organs, such as skin, lung, heart, and prostate. Synchronous CLL with urothelial carcinoma (UC) is an infrequent occurrence. We report this case because of its rarity in Indian literature and interesting hematological, immunophenotypic, histopathological, and cytopathological features of metastatic high-grade UC in a 61-year-old male with CLL.
