Background:Chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with progressive liver inflammation which in turn leads to cirrhosis and finally causes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By different escape mechanisms, the virus succeeds to evade the innate and acquired immune responses to establish chronic infection.Aim:This study aimed to evaluate the level of chemokine CXCL9 and its correlation with some biochemical parameters in different subjects of HCV patients.Materials and methods:A total of 83 persons participated in this study including healthy subjects without both HCV antibodies and HCV RNA (22.9%), HCV treated responders accomplished SVR post treatment, with HCV antibodies and absence of HCV RNA (24.1%), spontaneous or natural clearance patients, with positive HCV antibodies and negative HCV RNA without treatment (26.5%) and chronic HCV-patients, with both positive HCV antibodies and HCV RNA with no treatment (26.5%). HCV RNA was quantitated by real time PCR and serum CXCL9 level was measured by ELISA commercial kit pre-coated with human MIG/CXCL9 antibody. Assessment of biochemical and hematological parameters was carried out.Results:Data showed that, the level of CXCL9 was significantly increased in chronic individuals (627.1 pg/ml) (PConclusion:Serum Chemokine CXCL9 level is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV and response to HCV treatment, which may be identified as a predictive marker among HCV patients.
