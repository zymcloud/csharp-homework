Background:In view of the roles of long non-coding RNA CDKN2B antisense RNA 1 (CDKN2BAS1) in various human diseases, we investigated the function of CDKN2B-AS1 and explored its therapeutic and prognostic target value in multiple biological processes. The aim of this review was to explore the molecular mechanism and clinical significance of CDKN2B-AS1 in various types of diseases.Materials and methods:In this review, the biological functions and mechanisms of lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1 in a variety of pathophysiological processes were summarized and analyzed. The correlated studies were collected via a systematic search of PubMed, Wiley Online Library, and ScienceDirect.Results:CDKN2B-AS1 is a potential long non-coding RNA that has been shown to be aberrantly expressed in various malignancies, containing hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, colonic adenocarcinoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, glioma, lung cancer, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and osteosarcoma, involving in the processes of tumor cells proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of tumor cells apoptosis. Besides, CDKN2B-AS1 has been proved implicated in numerous non-malignant diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, endometriosis, inflammatory bowel disease, intracranial aneurysm, diabetes mellitus and its complications, primary open angle glaucoma, ischemic stroke, atherosclerosis, coronary artery diseases, hypertension and heart failure, participating in the procession of lipid, carbohydrate metabolism and inflammation regulation.Conclusion:Long non-coding RNA CDKN2B-AS1 likely serves as a promising therapeutic target or prognosis biomarker in multiple human diseases.
