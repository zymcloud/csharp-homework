Background/aim:The high rate of recurrence and repetitive features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) require specific treatment strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of recurrent HCC focusing on clinicopathological factors.Patients and methods:A total of 104 patients who were treated with re-hepatectomy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for recurrent HCC were analyzed. Post-recurrent prognoses were compared between each treatment group based on the presence of adverse prognostic factors (APFs) identified.Results:In the hepatectomy group, the prognosis of patients with APFs was significantly worse compared to those without APFs. By contrast, the survival rate of patients who underwent RFA was not significantly different from those with and without APFs.Conclusion:Our results demonstrate the heterogeneity that exists in terms of the long-term survival of patients with recurrent HCC. The treatment strategy for recurrent HCC should be based on the assessment of presence of APFs to improve long-term prognosis.
