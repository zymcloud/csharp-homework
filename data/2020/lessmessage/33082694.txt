In the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, achieving complete pathological response (CPR) in explanted liver specimens following any locoregional treatments is associated with reduced recurrence rates and better posttransplant survival compared to the incomplete response. Here, we present the imaging findings of a patient who achieved CPR in the explanted liver following Y-90 SIR-Spheres® therapy.
