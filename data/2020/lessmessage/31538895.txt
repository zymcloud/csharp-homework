Background:Spirothiazolidines are versatile synthetic scaffold possessing wide spectrum of biological interests involving potential anticancer activity.Objective:To report the first synthesis of Bis Spiro-thiazolidine as a novel heterocyclic ring system.Methods:One-pot three-component reaction including condensation of p-phenyllene diamine; cyclohexanone and thioglycolic acid produced Spiro-thiazolidine 4, which underwent further condensation with cyclohexanone and thioglycolic acid with equimolar ratio to introduce Bis-Spiothiazolidine 5 as the first synthesis. Also, bis spiro-thiazolidine arylidene derivatives 6-13 were synthesized by the reaction of Bis-Spiothiazolidine 5 with different aromatic benzaldehydes.Results:Four compounds 13, 12, 9 and 11 have shown highly significant anticancer activity compared to DoxorubicinÂ® (positive control) against Human liver carcinoma (HepG2) and Human Normal Retina pigmented epithelium (RPE-1) cell lines.Conclusion:The novel bis-spirothiazolidine deriviatives have been synthesized for the first time and showed excellent anticancer activities compare with the corresponding spirothiazolidine derivatives.
