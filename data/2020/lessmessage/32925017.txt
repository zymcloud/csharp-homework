Background:HCC is the most frequent primary liver cancer entity. Major risk factors comprise chronic HBC and HCV infections, ALD or NAFLD. Apart from the anamnesis, the clinical examination and serologic analysis, an essential part of the diagnostic HCC work-up is due to imaging findings from sonography, CT or MRI scans. HCC lesions feature a distinct vascularization pattern: hyperenhancement during early arterial and hypoenhancement/wash-out during portal venous or delayed phases. CEUS facilitates dynamic assessment of microperfusion patterns of suspicious liver lesions.Purpose:The purpose of the present retrospective single-center study was to determine the diagnostic value of CEUS for assessing HCC by comparison with findings from MRI scans.Materials and methods:Between 2004-2018 292 patients with suspicious liver lesions underwent CEUS and MRI. All patients underwent native B-mode, Color Doppler and CEUS after given informed consent. The applied contrast agent was a second-generation blood pool agent (SonoVueÂ®, Bracco, Milan, Italy). Every CEUS examination was performed and interpreted by a single experienced radiologist (EFSUMB Level 3).Results:CEUS was performed on all included patients without occurrence of any adverse effects. CEUS showed a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 91%, a PPV of 95% and a NPV of 94% for analyzing HCC in comparison with MRI as the diagnostic gold standard.Conclusion:With a distinguished safety profile CEUS shows a high diagnostic accuracy in assessing HCC compared to corresponding results from MRI scans.
