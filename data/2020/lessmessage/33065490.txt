Introduction:Hepatic venous outflow obstruction (HVOO) is a rare complication of hepatectomy. We report a case of HVOO caused by remnant liver migration into the subphrenic space after hepatectomy, which was successfully managed by repositioning of the remnant liver.Presentation of case:A 55-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with a liver tumor on ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed early enhancement in the arterial phase, followed by a washout in the late phase. Preoperative diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma, and hand-assisted laparoscopic extended posterior sectionectomy was performed. On postoperative day 1, middle hepatic vein (MHV) flow was not detected on ultrasound, and the portal flow was hepatofugal. CT during arterial portography revealed absence of the portal flow to the medial and anterior sections, and remnant liver migration into the subphrenic space. Therefore, we suspected that HVOO was caused by the remnant liver migration and performed redo laparotomy to reposition the remnant liver with suturing of the falciform ligament to the anterior abdominal wall. Postoperatively, contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated that the remnant liver remained in the anatomical position, and the medial and anterior sections were well enhanced.Discussion:HVOO might occur irrespective of whether the left triangular ligament is preserved. We believe that it is necessary to fix the remnant liver to the abdominal wall in cases with poor venous blood flow confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound. If kinking of the hepatic vein persists, stent insertion should be performed.Conclusion:HVOO after hepatectomy is rare but potentially fatal, and prevention and countermeasures should be discussed.
