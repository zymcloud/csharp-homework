Objective:To identify the stage of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) at the time of presentation.Methods:This cross sectional observational prospective study was carried out at Gastro Department of Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Multan from August 2017 to December 2018. Patients were diagnosed on the basis of alpha fetoprotein, abdominal ultrasound, triphasic contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CECT). They were evaluated for etiology including Hepatitis B, C and non B & C. The patients were inquired about the previous treatment and when they came to know about the HCC. Staging of the tumor was done on the basis BCLC (Barcelona cancer liver clinic) and Melan's criteria. Performance status (PS) of the patient was checked by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria. Severity of cirrhosis was assessed by CTP (Child Turcotte Pugh) and Model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score. The data was analyzed in IBM SPSS version 22.Results:Out of 135 patients 78% were males and 22% females. Age Mean SD was 58.81Â± 9.366. Frequency of hepatitis C, B, combined B, C and non-B non-C was 80%, 11%, 2.8% and 6.2% respectively. 96(73.8%) never got the treatment before for Hepatitis. 81(62.3%) came to know first time on this index admission. Maximum numbers of patients were in BCLC stage B i.e. 82(55.2%) with ECOG grade of one i.e.57 (39.3%), at the time of presentation. Mean MELD and CTP score were 12.24, 7.34 (class B) respectively.Conclusion:HCV was the most common in HCC, never treated before, presented for the first time in advance stage of the disease where very limited treatment options left behind.
