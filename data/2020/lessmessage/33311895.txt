Background:Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are expected to improve outcomes for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after liver transplantation (LT). We aim to evaluate trends in post-LT outcomes with availability of DAAs.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated US adults transplanted from January 1, 2002, to March 31, 2018, using the United Network for Organ Sharing Registry, stratified by pre-DAA (January 1, 2002- to December 31, 2013) vs. post-DAA (January 1, 2014-, to March 31, 2018) eras. Adjusted multivariate Cox regression analyses and competing risk models evaluated likelihood of graft failure, death, and retransplantation (re-LT).Results:Among 97,147 patients, 30.2% had HCV infection and 19.4% had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Of all patients, 31.9% experienced graft failure, 27.1% died after LT, and 4.7% underwent re-LT. The post-DAA era experienced lower likelihood of graft failure (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69, p Conclusion:Although patients with HCV infection and HCC had higher risk of post-LT graft failure and death in the pre-DAA era, the disparity disappeared in the post-DAA era independently of each other. This likely reflects impact of DAAs on improving post-LT outcomes among patients with HCV infection and improved selection of patients with HCC for LT after 2014.
