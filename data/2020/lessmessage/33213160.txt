Curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) traditionally include liver transplantation, liver resection, and in some very early HCCs, local ablation. Of these methods, transplantation brings the best long-term prognosis. Therefore, it should be considered by all multidisciplinary teams. Transplant treatment of HCC has developed significantly in recent years as does the concept of transplant oncology and in some centers HCC has already been the most common indication for liver transplantation. The aim of this work is to review the role of liver transplantation in the treatment of patients with HCC, its indications, results and the current situation in IKEM, the biggest transplantation center in the Czech Republic.
