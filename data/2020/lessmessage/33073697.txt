MiR-124-3p has been identified as a novel tumor suppressor and a potential therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through regulating its target genes. However, the upstream regulatory mechanisms of mir-124-3p in HCC has not been fully understood. The transcription factor liver X receptor (LXR) plays a critical role in suppressing the proliferation of HCC cells, but it is unclear whether LXR is involved in the regulation of mir-124-3p. In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression of mir-124-3p was positively correlated with that of LXR in HCC, and the cell growth of HCC was significantly inhibited by LXR agonists. Moreover, activation of LXR with the agonists up-regulated the expression of mir-124-3p, and in turn down-regulated cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) expression, which are the target genes of mir-124-3p. Mechanistically, miR-124-3p mediates LXR induced inhibition of HCC cell growth and down-regulation of cyclin D1 and CDK6 expression. In vivo experiments also confirmed that LXR induced miR-124-3p expression inhibited the growth of HCC xenograft tumors, as well as cyclin D1 and CDK6 expression. Our findings revealed that miR-124-3p is a novel target gene of LXR, and regulation of the miR-124-3p-cyclin D1/CDK6 pathway by LXR plays a crucial role in the proliferation of HCC cells. LXR-miR-124-3p-cyclin D1/CDK6 pathway may be a novel potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
