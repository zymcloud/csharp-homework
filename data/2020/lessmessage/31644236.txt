Androgenic steroids are used for male sex hormone replacement and in the therapy of malignancies. The androgens also have anabolic effects and are used in catabolic or muscle wasting states. In addition, the synthetic anabolic steroids are now widely used illicitly for exercise and athletic performance enhancement. Many synthetic androgenic steroids are capable of causing cholestatic liver injury and long term use of androgens is associated with development of liver tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma and vascular changes (peliosis hepatis).
