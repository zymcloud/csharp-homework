Objective:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment for unresectable intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma. Drug-eluting beads (DEB)-TACE is a promising approach expected to improve the efficiency and safety of conventional (c) TACE. However, controversy remains whether DEB-TACE performs better than cTACE. This meta-analysis aimed to compare cTACE and DEB-TACE in terms of overall survival (OS), adverse events, and response rate. Literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), disease control (DC), stable disease (SD), OS, and major complications were compared between these two modalities. The pooled relative risk and 95% confidence interval were calculated for assessment. Six randomized controlled trials were included for further analysis after a comprehensive search. No significant difference was found in overall response at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, CR, PR, DC (SD), OS and complications between cTACE and DEB-TACE.Conclusion:DEB-TACE had similar therapeutic effects to those of cTACE. Furthermore, major complications in both therapies were similar. The superiority of DEB-TACE over cTACE remains unclear, and further research with high-quality evidence is needed.
