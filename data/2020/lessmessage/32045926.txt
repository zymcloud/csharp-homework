The optimal type of surgery (e.g., anatomic or non-anatomic resection) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still under debate despite numerous comparative studies based on overall survival. This debate continues not only because these endpoints are influenced by non-surgical factors, such as liver function, but because the definition of non-anatomic resection for HCC has remained unclear. The optimal surgery could be logically determined based on the mechanism of local intrahepatic metastasis, that is, the drainage of tumour blood flow (TBF), because HCC spreads locally through tumour blood flowing to the peri-tumourous liver parenchyma. Since TBF is clearly demonstrated by CT scan under hepatic arteriography, the surgical margin can be determined individually based on the drainage of TBF without deteriorating local curability. Controversy regarding RFA and surgery does not result from the curability of treatment itself but from the lack of scientific evidence on safety margins. Based on proper concepts and self-evident truths, an algorithm of loco-regional treatment for HCC is proposed.
