Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Existing studies have highlighted significant disparities in HCC outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations, including ethnic minorities, safety-net populations, underinsured patients, and those with low socioeconomic status and high risk behaviors. The majority of these studies have focused on HCC surveillance. Although HCC surveillance is one of the most important first steps in HCC monitoring and management, it is only one step in the complex HCC cascade of care that evolves from surveillance to diagnosis and tumor staging that leads to access to HCC therapies. In this current review, we explore the disparities that exist along this complex HCC cascade of care and further highlight potential interventions that have been implemented to improve HCC outcomes. These interventions focus on patient, provider, and system level factors and provide a potential framework for health systems to implement quality improvement initiatives to improve HCC monitoring and management.
