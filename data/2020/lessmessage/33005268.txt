Introduction:Laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) is very difficult to perform in patients with cirrhosis because of the haemorrhagic and fibrotic nature of the liver, although there are various advantages to laparoscopic surgery.Aim:To investigate the surgical outcomes, and efficacy and safety of LH versus open hepatectomy (OH) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection.Material and methods:A total of 112 patients with cirrhosis, who underwent hepatectomy, were analysed retrospectively. We investigated the safety and efficacy of LH for HCC with cirrhosis. Student's t and Ï‡2 tests, Mann-Whitney's U test, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, and Fisher's exact test were used in the statistical analysis.Results:Seventy-one patients underwent LH, and 41 underwent OH. The conversion rate from LH to OH was 12.7%. After propensity score matching, the estimated blood loss was significantly lower in the LH group than in the OH group (25 vs. 310 ml; p < 0.001), and there was a significant difference between the groups in the operative time (p = 0.091). The LH group had complication rates of 3.6% and 0% for refractory ascites and pleural effusion, respectively, while those were 17.9% and 10.7%, respectively, in the OH group (p = 0.019 and p = 0.005, respectively). The LH group had no mortality, whereas the OH group had a mortality rate of 10.7% (p = 0.038). The postoperative length of stay was significantly longer in the LH group than in the OH group (9 days vs. 14 days) (p = 0.002).Conclusions:LH can be performed safely for HCC with cirrhosis. More favourable results are achieved with LH than with OH in terms of surgical outcomes.
