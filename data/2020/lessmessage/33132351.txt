Coriandrum sativum (coriander) is an annual herb in the Apiaceae family. Its leaves and seeds are used for cooking. Coriander has several beneficial functions such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-cancer effects. Although anti-carcinogenic potential of coriander has been known well, the effects of coriander on cancer metastasis have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, the effects of coriander on migration and invasion were investigated in vitro and in vivo by using human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and mouse melanoma cell line (B16F10). The migration and invasion abilities of cancer cells had been evaluated by trans-well double chamber and these abilities were significantly impaired by treatment of cancer cells with coriander extract whose concentration did not affect proliferation. The treatment of cancer cells with coriander extract significantly reduced both matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) activities, which were involved in cell migration and invasion, in their conditioned media. Furthermore, coriander extract suppressed the phosphorylation of Erk 1 or IkB in B16F10 cells, and inhibited the expression of MMP-2 or u-PA mRNA. After injection of B16F10 cells into the tail vein of C57BL/6J mice, the number of metastatic regions in lungs were counted. Mice fed with diet containing coriander possessed a smaller number of metastatic regions than those fed with control diet. It was suggested that coriander extract might have the abilities to suppress cancer cell migration and invasion, indicating that coriander provides the improvement of cancer prognosis.
