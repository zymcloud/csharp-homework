In this article, we aim to review Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System version 18 (LI-RADS v2018). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary hepatic malignancy. Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System developed for standardizing interpreting, reporting, and data collection of HCC describes 5 major features for accurate HCC diagnosis and several ancillary features, some favoring HCC in particular or malignancy in general and others favoring benignity. Untreated hepatic lesions LI-RADS affords 8 unique categories based on imaging appearance on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, which indicate the possibility of HCC or malignancy with or without tumor in vein. Furthermore, LI-RADS defines 4 treatment response categories for treated HCCs after different locoregional therapy. These continuous recent updates on LI-RADS improve the communication between the radiologists and the clinicians for better management and patient outcome.
