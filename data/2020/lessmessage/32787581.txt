As a novel class of noncoding RNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been recently reported to be involved in cell development and function. However, the functional role of circRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In the present study, we found that the expression of human circ_101141 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. In addition, downregulation of circ_101141 dramatically inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC cells. In addition, by using the bioinformatics tools, the potential target of circ_101141 was predicted. Mechanistic investigations indicated that circ_101141 acted as a miR-1297 "sponge"; meanwhile, Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) was a direct target of miR-1297. Further experiments demonstrated that circ_101141 contributed to the progression of HCC by acting as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-1297 to regulate ROCK1 expression. Furthermore, knockdown of circ_101141 attenuated HCC tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicated that circRNA circ_101141 acted as a ceRNA to facilitate tumorigenesis of HCC by regulating miR-1297/ROCK1 pathway.
