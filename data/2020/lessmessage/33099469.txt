Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major type of primary liver cancer. Mice lacking the tumor-suppressive protein phosphatase 2A subunit B56δ (Ppp2r5d) spontaneously develop HCC, correlating with increased c-MYC oncogenicity.Materials and methods:We used two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis-coupled matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify differential proteomes of livers from wild-type, non-cancerous and HCC-affected B56δ knockout mice.Results:A total of 23 proteins were differentially expressed/regulated in liver between wild-type and non-cancerous knockout mice, and 119 between non-cancerous and HCC knockout mice ('cancer proteins'). Overlap with our reported differential transcriptome data was poor. Overall, 56% of cancer proteins were reported before in HCC proteomics studies; 44% were novel. Gene Ontology analysis revealed cancer proteins mainly associated with liver metabolism (18%) and mitochondria (15%). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified 'cancer' and 'gastrointestinal disease' as top hits.Conclusion:We identified several proteins for further exploration as novel potential HCC biomarkers, and independently underscored the relevance of Ppp2r5d knockout mice as a valuable hepatocarcinogenesis model.
