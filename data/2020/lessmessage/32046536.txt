The traditional Chinese medicine formula Jianpi-Huayu (JPHY) has been reported to be effective in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this article, we employed an orthotopic transplantation model in nude mice to explore whether JPHY could inhibit the development of HCC by regulating miR-602, which targets the Ras association domain-containing protein 1A (RASSF1A) pathway. HCC SMMC-7721 cells were treated with JPHY to test whether the RASSF1A gene as mediated by miR-602 affected the proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells. We subsequently detected miR-602, RASSF1A, and tumor cell apoptosis-related markers in cells and liver tumor tissues. We observed that mice treated with JPHY had smaller tumors and higher survival rates than untreated ones. Similarly, JPHY-treated SMMC-7721 cells exhibited alterations in morphology and higher cytotoxicity compared with the control group. Furthermore, we found that JPHY decreased overexpression of miR-602 and increased protein expression levels of the RASS1A gene, which in turn altered protein expression levels of tumor cell apoptosis-related genes in the cells and liver tumor tissues of drug-treated mice. These results indicated that JPHY could potentially be used to treat HCC by targeting miR-602, which targets the RASSF1A gene, which in turn plays a major role in HCC pathogenesis.
