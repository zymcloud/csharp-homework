Purpose: To investigate technical success, technique efficacy, safety and outcome of MR-guided microwave ablation (MWA) in hepatic malignancies.Material and methods: In this prospective IRB-approved study, patients scheduled for percutaneous treatment of hepatic malignancies underwent MR-guided MWA in a closed-bore 1.5 T MR system. Technical success was assessed on post-procedural MR control imaging. Technique efficacy was evaluated 4 weeks after the procedure on multi-parametric MRI. Assessment of safety followed the Society of Interventional Radiology grading system. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were calculated to evaluate overall survival (OS), time to local tumor progression (TLTP), and time to non-target progression (TNTP).Results: Between 2015 and 2019, 47 patients (60.5 ± 12.2 years; 39 male) underwent 50 procedures for 58 hepatic tumors (21 hepatocellular carcinomas; 37 metastases). Mean target tumor size was 16 ± 7mm (range: 6-39 mm). Technical success and technique efficacy were 100% and 98%, respectively. Lesions were treated using 2.6 applicator positions (range: 1-6). Mean energy, ablation duration per tumor, and procedure duration were 43.2 ± 23.5 kJ, 26.7 ± 13.1 min and 211.2 ± 68.7 min, respectively. 10 minor (20%) and 3 major (6%) complications were observed. Median post-interventional hospital admission was 1 day (range: 1-19 days). Median OS was 41.6 (IQR: 26.4-) months. Local recurrence occurred after 4 procedures (8%) with TLTP ranging between 3.1 and 41.9 months. Non-target recurrence was observed in 64% of patients after a median TNTP of 13.8 (IQR 2.3-) months.Conclusion: MR-guided MWA allows for safe and successful treatment of hepatic malignancies with a high technique efficacy however with relatively long procedure durations.
