Hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are the most common types of primary liver cancers. Moreover, the liver is the second most frequently involved organ in cancer metastasis after lymph nodes. The tumor microenvironment is crucial for the development of both primary and secondary liver cancers. The hepatic microenvironment consists of multiple cell types, including liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, natural killer cells, liver-associated lymphocytes, and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The microenvironment of a normal liver changes to a tumor microenvironment when tumor cells exist or tumor cells migrate to and multiply in the liver. Interactions between tumor cells and non-transformed cells generate a tumor microenvironment that contributes significantly to tumor progression. HSCs play a central role in the tumor microenvironment crosstalk. As this crosstalk is crucial for liver carcinogenesis and liver-tumor development, elucidating the mechanism underlying the interaction of HSCs with the tumor microenvironment could provide potential therapeutic targets for liver cancer.
