Background:Although secretory clusterin (sCLU) plays a crucial role in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) cells proliferation, Multiple Drug Resistance (MDR), metastasis and so on, its targeted effects and exact mechanism are still unknown. This review summarizes some new progress in sCLU as a molecular-targeted therapy in the treatment of HCC.Methods:A systematic review of the published English-language literature about sCLU and HCC has been performed using the PubMed and bibliographic databases. Some valuable studies on sCLU in HCC progression were searched for relevant articles with the keywords: HCC, diagnosis, MDR, as molecular-targeted in treatment, and so on.Results:The incidence of the positive rate of sCLU was significantly higher in HCC tissues as compared to the surrounding tissues at mRNA or protein level, gradually increasing with tumor-nodemetastasis staging (PConclusion:Abnormal hepatic sCLU expression should not only be a new diagnostic biomarker but also a novel promising target for inhibiting HCC growth.
