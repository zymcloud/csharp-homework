Aim:Inflammation-based markers, such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), have recently been used as prognostic indicators in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to determine whether NLR and PLR may predict response to yttrium-90 transarterial radioembolization (TARE) as primary treatment for HCC.Methods:We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of HCC cases (1994-2019) and selected patients who received TARE as primary treatment (n = 42). Laboratory studies were used to calculate NLR and PLR. Response to TARE was determined using the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST). Patients were classified as non-responders (stable or progressive disease) or responders (partial or complete response) to treatment based on mRECIST.Results:Receiver operating characteristic curves identified a pre-treatment NLR cutoff of ≥ 2.83 and a pre-treatment PLR cutoff of ≥ 83 for predicting non-response to treatment. Pre-treatment NLR ≥ 2.83 was the only significant predictor of non-response to TARE in multivariate logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 7.83, P = 0.036). On time to progression analysis, both pre-treatment NLR ≥ 2.83 and pre-treatment PLR ≥ 83 were associated with a higher proportion of tumor progression at 6 months post-treatment (43.6% vs. 10.0%, P = 0.014, log-rank) and (38.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.010, log-rank), respectively.Conclusion:NLR confers prognostic value and may be superior to PLR in determining response to TARE as primary treatment for HCC. Future studies are necessary to validate these findings in a larger cohort.
