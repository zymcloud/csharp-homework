Liver cancer, being the utmost prevalent fatal malignancy worldwide, is ranked as the fifth leading cause of deaths associated with cancer. Patients with liver cancer are diagnosed often at an advanced stage, contributing to poor prognosis. Of all forms of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) contributes to 90% of cases, with chemotherapy being the treatment of choice. However, unfavorable toxicity of chemotherapy drugs and the vulnerability of nucleic acid-based drugs to degradation, have limited their application in clinical settings. So, in order to improvise their therapeutic efficacy in HCC treatment, various nanocarrier drug delivery systems have been explored. Furthermore, nanoparticle based imaging provides valuable means of accurately diagnosing HCC. Thus, in recent years, the advent of nanomedicine has shown great potential and progress in dramatically altering the approach to the diagnosis as well as treatment of liver cancer. Nanoparticles (NPs) are being explored as potential drug carriers for small molecules, miRNAs, and therapeutic genes used for liver cancer treatment. This review emphasizes on the current developments and applications of nanomedicine based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches in HCC.
