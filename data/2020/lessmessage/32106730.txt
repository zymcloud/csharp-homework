Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous ultrasound-guided 'three-step' radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of giant hepatic hemangioma.Materials and methods: Patients with giant hepatic hemangioma who underwent percutaneous ultrasound-guided 'three-step' RFA (n = 52) and conventional RFA (n = 54) at our center from June 2013 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The 'three-step' RFA proceeds as follows. Step 1: Ablate the feeding artery of the hemangioma. Step 2: Aspirate blood from the tumor. Step 3: Ablation the lesion. Intraoperative information, postoperative recovery, therapeutic effects, and complications were compared between the two groups.Results: The duration of RFA was significantly shorter (19.2 ± 0.8 min versus 44.5 ± 2.8 min, p < 0.001), the number of punctures was significantly lower (3.2 ± 0.1 versus 4.7 ± 0.3, p = 0.002), and the duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter (9.0 ± 0.5 versus 11.5 ± 0.7, p = 0.013) in the TS-RFA group than in the C-RFA group. The complete ablation rate (86.5% versus 40.7%), the maximum postoperative pain score (2.5 ± 1.3 versus 4.1 ± 2.0) and symptom relief were also significantly better in the TS-RFA group than in the C-RFA group (p < 0.05). No postoperative death occurred in either group. There were no grade III or higher complications in the TS-RFA group, but one patient in the C-RFA group developed the grade III complication of postoperative abdominal bleeding.Conclusions: 'Three-step' RFA is a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment for giant hepatic hemangioma. It is worthy of further promotion and application.
