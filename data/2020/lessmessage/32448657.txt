Introduction:Portosystemic collaterals (PsC) are a common finding in patients with cirrhosis who need liver transplantation (LT), and PsCs may cause several problems before and after LT. We report a case of successful surgical treatment of severe hepatic encephalopathy (HE) caused by PsC after living-donor LT (LDLT).Case:A 71-year-old woman with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent LDLT for chronic hepatitis C virus infection at 64 years of age. The splenocaval collateral vein was ligated during LDLT to prevent portal flow steal. A recurrent episode of coma due to HE was triggered 7 years after LDLT and gradually became refractory to any drug treatments. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed the development of the right gastroepiploic vein (RGEV), which flowed to the inferior vena cava via the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV). Owing to the chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 11-31 mL/min), interventional radiology (IVR) was not indicated, so surgical treatment was selected to treat the symptom. PsC was resected at the point of the RGEV and IMV, just before flowing into the IVC with vascular staplers. Antegrade portal blood flow was obtained by ultrasonography 2 days after surgery, and the patient was discharged from the hospital 26 days after the operation. After discharge, she has had no recurrent episode of HE.Conclusion:Surgical resection of the PsC was effective for treatment of HE caused by shunt flow after LDLT.
