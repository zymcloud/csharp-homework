Purpose: This study evaluated the usefulness of intraprocedural contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)/ultrasound (US) fusion imaging using a perflubutane-based contrast agent combined with preprocedural auto sweep three-dimensional US to obtain volume data for guidance and evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods: This uncontrolled clinical trial included 50 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with a mean diameter of 15.3 mm that had been treated by RFA. The efficacy of RFA was evaluated by CEUS/US fusion imaging during the procedure. If the ablation was deemed to be inadequate, further ablation was performed until adequate ablation was achieved. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) was performed a month after RFA, and the images obtained using each modality were reviewed to evaluate the efficacy of RFA.Results: Thirty-three of the 50 lesions were evaluated by CEUS/US fusion imaging as having been adequately ablated after the first RFA procedure. The ablation was evaluated as inadequate in the remaining 17 lesions, for which additional ablation was performed. Ninety-eight (49/50) of all HCCs were evaluated as having been eventually adequately ablated on intraprocedural CEUS/US fusion imaging. The concordance rate for evaluations between intraprocedural CEUS/US fusion imaging and CECT/CEMRI performed 1 month after RFA was 88% (44/50). The kappa value for agreement between the two methods of evaluation was 0.792.Conclusion: Intraprocedural fusion imaging combining CEUS and auto sweep three-dimensional US appears to be a useful modality for RFA guidance and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of RFA in patients with HCC.
