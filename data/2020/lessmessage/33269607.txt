Objective:This study aimed to investigate the associations between RAD51AP1 and the outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:RAD51AP1 expression levels were compared in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. The Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA, Provisional) and GSE36376 datasets were used for survival analysis. RAD51AP1 associations with clinicopathological features were determined with the GSE36376 dataset.Results:RAD51AP1 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in advanced liver fibrosis samples (S3-4 vs. S0-2 and G3-4 vs. G0-2) from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver fibrosis patients and in tumor tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HCC patients (all P < 0.05). HCC patients with high RAD51AP1 expression had significantly worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than those with low RAD51AP1 expression (P = 0.0034 and P = 0.0012, respectively) in the TCGA dataset, and these findings were validated with the GSE36376 dataset (P = 0.0074 and P = 0.0003, respectively). A Cox regression model indicated that RAD51AP1 was a risk factor for OS and DFS in HCC patients in GSE36376 (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.02-2.32, P = 0.04 and HR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.22-2.39, P = 0.002, respectively). Moreover, RAD51AP1 mRNA expression increased gradually with increasing tumor stage, including stratification by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages and Edmondson grades. In addition, RAD51AP1 was overexpressed in HCC patients with intrahepatic metastasis, major portal vein invasion, vascular invasion and/or an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level > 300 ng/ml.Conclusions:Contributing to an advanced tumor stage, intrahepatic metastasis, vascular invasion and AFP level elevation, RAD51AP1 upregulation was significantly associated with OS and DFS in HCC patients.
