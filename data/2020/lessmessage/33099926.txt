Purpose:To investigate the efficacy of surgical resection for patients with different sizes of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to analyze the risk factors influencing the prognosis.Methods:The clinical data of a total of 138 patients with HBV-related HCC admitted to and treated in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were retrospectively analyzed, and the patients were divided into small HCC (SHCC) group (tumor diameter ≤5 cm, n=69) and solitary large HCC (SLHCC) group (tumor diameter >5 cm, n=69) based on the size of tumors. The differences in operative methods, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, number of intraoperative blood transfusion, time of portal triad clamping and incidence of complications, as well as postoperative liver function and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) indexes, tumor recurrence and survival conditions were compared between the two groups.Results:Among the 138 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy, 54 cases had ≥3 resected hepatic segments, and 84 cases had 5 cm and positive microvascular invasion were independent risk factors for the patient's prognosis (pConclusions:SLHCC has a similar disease-free survival rate to SHCC but a lower overall survival rate than SHCC. HBV DNA load ≥104 U/mL, tumor diameter >5 cm and positive microvascular invasion are independent risk factors for the patient's prognosis.
