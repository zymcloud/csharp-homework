Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a continuous diseases spectrum associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. Simple hepatic steatosis may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), even fibrosis and cirrhosis, and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, NAFLD has become a public health concern with increasing prevalence. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, and few effective therapeutic approaches are available. Summary and Key Messages: A myriad of different rodent models has been developed to elucidate pathophysiology of NAFLD/NASH and guide therapeutic strategy. To date, no single rodent model can display the whole disease spectrum and metabolic features associated with human NASH, but can imitate particular characteristics. In this paper, we review the most commonly used dietary, genetic, and chemical rodent models for NAFLD referring to their advantages and disadvantages. Also, we illustrate the status of latest treatment strategy using various NAFLD rodent models. We hope to provide critical guidance for researchers to select appropriate animal models.
