Purpose:This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) adjacent to large vessels with those far from large vessels.Methods:The clinical data of patients who underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous MWA for HCC were retrospectively analyzed between January 2011 and December 2018 in Shengjing Hospital. Patients with HCC adjacent to large vessels were included in the Vessel group, the remaining patients were included in the Control group. Propensity score matching analysis was used to reduce confounding bias. The rates of complete ablation, local recurrence, recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) and complications were compared between the two groups.Results:A total of 134 patients with 157 nodules (size range, 0.6-3.8 cm) were enrolled in this study, 23 in the Vessel group and 111 in the Control group. A total of 21 patients in the Vessel group (91.3%) and 105 patients in the Control group (94.6%) achieved complete ablation (p = .902). Following 1:2 propensity score matching, 22 patients were included in the Vessel group and 40 patients were enrolled in the Control group. Local recurrence was observed in 2 (9.1%) patients in the Vessel group and 5 (12.5%) in the Control group (p = .86). No significant difference in local recurrence rate, RFS and OS were observed between the two groups.Conclusions:Ultrasound-guided percutaneous MWA appears to be a safe procedure and can achieve comparable oncological efficacy for HCC abutting large vessels.
