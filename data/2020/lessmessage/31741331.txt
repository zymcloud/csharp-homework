Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus, belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family. It is a partially double-stranded DNA virus with a small viral genome (3.2 kb). Chronic HBV infection remains a global public health problem. If left untreated, chronic HBV infection can progress to end-stage liver disease, such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In recent years, tremendous advances in the field of HBV basic and clinical research have been achieved, ranging from the HBV biological characteristics, immunopathogenesis, and animal models to the development of new therapeutic strategies and new drugs against HBV. In this overview, we begin with a brief history of HBV discovery and treatment milestones. We then briefly summarize the HBV research advances, which will be detailed in the following chapters.
