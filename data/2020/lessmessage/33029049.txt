Background & aims:Whether higher liver transplant (LT) waitlist mortality in patients with poor functional status (FS) is mediated by higher prevalence of cirrhosis complications is not clear. We aim to evaluate the impact of FS on risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) among adults listed for LT.Methods:Using 2005-2018 United Network for Organ Sharing LT data, we retrospectively evaluated the impact of FS on prevalence of ascites, HE, and SBP among adults listed for LT using Karnofsky Performance Status Score categories (KPSS-1: FS 80-100%, KPSS-2: 60-70%, KPSS-3: 40-50%, KPSS-4: 10-30%), stratified by underlying liver disease etiology. Between-group comparisons used chi-squared methods and adjusted multivariate logistic regression.Results:Among 100,618 adults listed for LT (68.8% male, 72.4% non-Hispanic white) 35.2% were KPSS-1, 36.6% KPSS-2, 15.7% KPSS-3, and 12.6% KPSS-4 at time of LT waitlist registration. Patients with worse FS were significantly more likely to have ascites, HE, and SBP at time of waitlist registration (KPSS-1 vs. KPSS-4: ascites, 66% vs. 93%; HE, 81% vs. 49%; SBP, 4% vs. 16%, p Conclusion:Worse FS is associated with higher odds of cirrhosis complications including ascites, HE, and SBP, which was observed across all liver disease etiologies.
