Background:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a standard treatment for small inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies on mid- and long-term outcome of RFA as first-line therapy for HCC from India are limited.Methods:We evaluated consecutive HCC patients who underwent RFA as primary treatment modality at our institute between July 2009 and April 2016. The median follow-up period was 26 months, range 1-84 months. We evaluated post-RFA tumor response, disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and local tumor progression (LTP). Prognostic factors were also analyzed.Results:In 147 patients (male:female = 121:26; mean age, 59.2 years), 209 RFA sessions were done for 228 lesions (mean size of 21.5 ± 8.3 mm, range 10-50 mm). Primary success rate was 94.2%. The estimated cumulative proportion survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 90.2%, 63.8%, and 60.2%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of LTP estimated at 1, 3, and 5 years was 13.1%, 19.7%, and 20.1%, respectively. The mean estimate of LTP-free survival was 53.6 months (95% confidence interval: 0.49-0.58) which is 58.2 months in 3 cm lesions (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in LTP rates between lesions in perivascular versus nonperivascular location (P = 0.71) and surface versus parenchymal lesions (P = 0.66). The mean DFS was 30.3 months (95% CI: 25.6-35.0). For OS, age and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B were significant factors while for LTP, tumor size >3 cm was significant. Higher baseline alpha-fetoprotein level and LTP were poor predictors for DFS. Complication rate per RFA session was 7/209 (3.3%).Conclusions:RFA is a safe and effective curative modality for first-line treatment of HCC
