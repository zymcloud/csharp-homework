Introduction:Renal cell carcinoma comprises over 90% of renal cancers, thus, it is the most common form of renal neoplasia. This carcinoma can often present itself in a variable fashion, ranging from incidentalomas to metastatic diseases. Furthermore, the most common metastasis associated with this type of carcinoma occurs in the lungs, bones or liver. We aim to report a case of renal cell carcinoma which presented together with a fibromixoid sarcoma.Case presentation:A 50 year-old woman presented with hematuria, weight loss, asthenia and right lumbar pain that started 7 months prior to the consult. CT scan was performed and revealed a solid injury of 10 cm in the right kidney together with a mass in the left flank. Total right nephrectomy was promptly performed and the patient was submitted 3 months later to a tumoral resection of the abdominal wall. Histopathological findings revealed a primary renal cell carcinoma and the second, metastatic tumor was shown to be a fibromixoid sarcoma. The patient was not submitted to chemotherapy and is currently under follow-up with the surgery and oncology staffs, without showing any symptoms.Discussion:Renal cell carcinoma usually presents itself together with secondary tumors on the lungs and bones. The association of this type of carcinoma with a fibromixoid sarcoma of the abdominal wall is rare and poorly reported in the literature.Conclusion:This case reports shows a successful treatment regarding this rare association, which can help other physicians to re-evaluate their medical conduct.
