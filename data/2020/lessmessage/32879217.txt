Tivantinib, a mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (cMET) inhibitor, is a molecular targeting drug that kills hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Tivantinib alone does not affect the overall survival of patients with HCC, and combination treatment with tivantinib and other therapies has not been evaluated. This study was conducted to clarify the effect of the tivantinib in regulating breast cancer therapy-resistant protein (BCRP), a key transporter of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and dihydropyridine dehydrogenase (DPYD), a major metabolic enzyme of 5-FU. To this end, cMET gene expression was determined by RT-PCR in HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells. The transcriptional start sites of BCRP were determined by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE). BCRP and DPYD mRNA levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR, and promoter activities were measured by dual-luciferase assays. Results show that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) upregulated the mRNA level of BCRP, but not DPYD, in HepG2 cells. The upregulation of BCRP expression by HGF was down-regulated by tivantinib. We also identified two transcriptional start sites (E1α, E1β) in BCRP by 5'-RACE. The transcriptional activity of the region -287 to E1α of BCRP was upregulated by HGF, which was decreased by tivantinib, whereas activity of the region -297 to E1βo f BCRP was not affected by tivantinib. Therefore, tivantinib regulates BCRP expression upstream of exon 1α. Combination treatment of tivantinib and 5-FU should be further evaluated for HCC therapy.
