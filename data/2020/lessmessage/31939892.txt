Aim:This study aimed to assess the interobserver agreement of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2018 (LI-RADS v2018).Subjects and methods:Retrospective analysis was done for 119 consecutive patients (77 male and 42 female) at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent dynamic contrast MR imaging. Image analysis was done by 2 independent and blinded readers for arterial phase hyperenhancement, washout appearance, enhancing capsule appearance, and size. Hepatic lesions were classified into 7 groups according to LI-RADS v2018.Results:There was excellent interobserver agreement of both reviewers for LR version 4 (κ = 0.887, P = 0.001) with 90.76% agreement. There was excellent interobserver agreement for nonrim arterial phase hyperenhancement (κ = 0.948; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-0.99; P = 0.001), washout appearance (κ = 0.949; 95% CI, 0.89-1.0; P = 0.001); and enhancing capsule (κ = 0.848; 95% CI, 0.73-0.97; P = 0.001) and excellent reliability of size (interclass correlation, 0.99; P = 0.001). There was excellent interobserver agreement for LR-1 (κ = 1.00, P = 0.001), LR-2 (κ = 0.94, P = 0.001), LR-5 (κ = 0.839, P = 0.001), LR-M (κ = 1.00, P = 0.001), and LR-TIV (κ = 1.00; 95% CI, 1.0-1.0; P = 0.001), and good agreement for LR-3 (κ = 0.61, P = 0.001) and LR-4 (κ = 0.61, P = 0.001).Conclusion:MR imaging of LI-RADS v2018 is a reliable imaging modality and reporting system that may be used for standard interpretation of hepatic focal lesions.
