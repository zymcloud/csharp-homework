Curcumin, isolated from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, is one of the most extensively studied phytochemicals. This natural compound has a variety of pharmacological effects including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, cardio-protective, hepato-protective and anti-diabetic. Wnt signaling pathway, one of the potential targets of curcumin through upregulation and/or downregulation, plays a significant role in many diseases, even in embryogenesis and development of various organs and systems. In order to exert an anti-tumor activity in the organism, curcumin seems to inhibit the Wnt pathway. The downstream mediators of Wnt signaling pathway such as c-Myc and cyclin D1 are also modified by curcumin. This review demonstrates how curcumin influences the Wnt signaling pathway and is beneficial for the treatment of neurological disorders (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases), cancers (melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, endothelial carcinoma, gastric carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma) and other diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or bone disorders.
