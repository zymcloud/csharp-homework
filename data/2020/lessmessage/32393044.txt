Echinococcus multilocularis causes an aggressive form of hydatidosis whose histomorphological picture is generally not well recognized. We report a case of 39-year-old women presenting with poorly circumscribed nodules in the right hepatic lobe. Owing to the clinical suspicion of focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenoma, a core biopsy was performed. The histological findings of necrotic fibrous tissue infiltrated by narrow epithelial cords and small cysts containing cytokeratin positive material were in concordance with the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Subsequent examination of the surgically resected necrotic nodules with a vital tissue at the periphery corresponded to a reparative fibrosis accompanied by a striking ductular proliferation. Serological and molecular genetic work-up led to the diagnosis of Echinococcus multilocularis. The aim of this report is to point out the unusual histological features of the solid foci of alveolar hydatidosis, which consisted of necrotic fibrous tissue with ductular reaction. Such findings in a core biopsy may simulate regressively altered carcinoma.
