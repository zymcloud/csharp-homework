Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) often leads to development of chronic liver disease. In fact, 10% of infected adults and almost 90% of infected infants develop chronic hepatitis B associated with severe liver diseases, including acute liver failure, liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. At present there is no effective cure for chronic hepatitis B. The current treatment of chronically infected patients is long-term, expensive and relies on treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs in combination with immune therapies, that frequently lead to adverse side effects. Recently, the National Institute of Health proposed strategic plan for Trans-NIH research to cure hepatitis B. The key priority is better understanding of HBV life cycle and its interactions with host cell. Due to the fact that HBV is a small double stranded DNA virus encoding only a limited number of proteins, HBV replication widely relies on host cell pathways and proteins. As demonstrated by numerous reports, HBV core protein (HBc) which is the main component of viral nucleocapsid, plays multiple roles in HBV life cycle and is engaged in many protein interaction networks of the host cell. Several recent studies have shown that HBV proteins can be modified by different types of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that affect their protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization and function. In this review, we discuss diverse PTMs of HBc and their role in regulation of HBc function in the context of HBV replication and pathogenesis. Keywords: hepatitis B virus; posttranslational modifications; HBV core protein; phosphorylation; ubiquitination; arginine methylation.
