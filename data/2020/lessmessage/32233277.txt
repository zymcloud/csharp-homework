We report the case of a hepatocellular adenoma associated with focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatic granulomas in a 30-yearsold woman. This association has rarely been described before but might be explained by underlying common pathophysiologic mechanisms. In this manuscript possible links between the three entities are discussed.
hepatocytes; liver; pathophysiology.
