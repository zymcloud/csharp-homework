Background:LncRNA DLEU1 participates in various biological processes, playing an indispensable role in the pathophysiology of human diseases, especially in tumorigenesis and other processes. Besides, it may represent a promising target for biotherapy in numerous tumors. The aim of this review was to reveal the pathophysiological functions and mechanisms of lncRNA DLEU1 in different types of cancer.Methods:In this review, current studies concerning the biological functions and mechanisms of DLEU1 in tumor development are summarized and analyzed; the related researches are collected through a systematic retrieval of PubMed.Results:DLEU1 is a novel cancer-associated lncRNA that has been proved to be abnormally elevated in various malignancies, containing osteosarcoma, glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, hepatocellular carcinoma, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, endometrial cancer, gastric cancer, Burkitt lymphoma and ovarian carcinoma. Besides, lncRNA LDEU1 has been demonstrated involving in the procession of proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of cancer cells.Conclusion:Long non-coding RNA DLEU1 is likely to represent an available biomarker or a potential therapeutic target in multiple tumors.
