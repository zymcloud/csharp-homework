Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are major contributors to the burden of liver disease today. Effective therapeutic strategies for prevention of progression of NASH to cirrhosis are still elusive. As with other diseases causing cirrhosis, NASH also increases risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD without cirrhosis also, has been shown to be a risk factor for HCC but pathogenesis of HCC in these patients, is not clear. Several risk factors for HCC in patients with NAFLD-/NASH-related cirrhosis have been identified. Surveillance strategies for HCC in NASH-related cirrhosis is similar to other patients with cirrhosis. No guidelines are currently available for surveillance in patients with NAFLD exclusively, owing to considerable gaps in knowledge. Prevention of NAFLD and lifestyle changes addressing the risk factors for HCC remain the backbone of managing patients with NAFLD- and NAFLD-related complications such as HCC.
