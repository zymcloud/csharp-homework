Background:Race, gender, insurance status, and income play important roles in predicting health care outcomes. However, the impact of these factors has yet to be fully elucidated in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We designed a retrospective cohort study utilizing data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to identify patients diagnosed with resectable HCC (N = 28,518). Demographic factors of interest included race (Asian/Pacific Islander [API], African American [AA], Native American/Alaska Native [NA], or White [WH]) and gender (male [M] or female [F]). Insurance classifications included those having Medicare/Private Insurance [ME/PI], Medicaid [MAID], or No Insurance [NI]. Median household income was estimated for all diagnosed with HCC. Endpoints included: (1) overall survival; (2) likelihood of receiving a recommendation for surgery; and (3) specific surgical intervention performed. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression for relative risk ratio (RRR) and Cox regression models were used to identify pertinent associations.Results:Race, gender, insurance status, and income had statistically significant effects on the likelihood of surgical recommendation and overall survival. API were more likely to receive a recommendation for hepatic resection (RRR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.31-1.61; Reference Race: AA) and exhibited prolonged overall survival (HR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.73-0.82; Reference Race: AA) as compared to members of any other ethnic group; there was no difference in these endpoints between AA, NA, or WH individuals. Gender also had a significant effect on survival: Females exhibited superior overall survival (HR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.85-0.93; Reference Gender: M) as compared to males. Patients who had ME/PI were more likely than those with MAID or NI to receive a surgical recommendation. ME/PI was also associated with superior overall survival. Conclusions: Race, gender, insurance status, and income have measurable effects on HCC management and outcomes. The underlying causes of these disparities warrant further investigation.
