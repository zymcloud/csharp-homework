Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a severe disease with high mortality in the world. Emerging evidence has suggested that lncRNAs play an important role in cancer progression, including HCC. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the effect of lncRNA RHPN1 antisense RNA 1 (RHPN1-AS1) on HCC and its underlying molecular mechanism. In this study, we evaluated the expressions of lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 and miR-7-5p by qRT-RCR in both HCC tissue and HCC cells. Our findings showed that lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 was upregulated in HCC tissue and HCC cells, while miR-7-5p was downregulated. LncRNA RHPN1-AS1 expression in HCC patients was closely related to vascular invasion, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage. Furthermore, we quantified cell clone-formation ability, proliferation, migration and invasion of HCCLM3 and MHCC97 H cells using several assays (colony formation assay, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay and transwell assay, respectively). Functional experiments confirmed that silencing lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in HCCLM3 and MHCC97 H cells. After that, bioinformatics analysis, dual luciferase reporter gene assay, qRT-PCR and western blot were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 on HCC. Mechanistically, the rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-7-5p inhibitor reversed the inhibition effect of silencing lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 on HCCLM3 cells proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, silencing lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 also inhibited the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Taken together our findings demonstrated that lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 could facilitate cell proliferation, migration and invasion via targeting miR-7-5p and activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in HCC.
