Purpose:Liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered as one of the most frequent malignancies with significantly high morbidity and mortality across the globe. MicroRNAs (miRs) are regarded as important regulators of liver cancer formation and its development. However, the full biochemical mechanism of their role is still very less understood. The main objective of the current research work was to examine the role of miR-16/cyclin-B1 axis in liver cancer regulation and how this pathway along with liver cancer migration and invasion are targeted by zingiberene molecule.Methods:Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate miR-16 expression in HCC cell lines. Western blotting was performed to evaluate the expression of the miR-16 target genes. Effects on cell migration and invasion were evaluated by in vitro wound healing assay and transwell Matrigel assay, respectively. Effects of zingiberene on HCC cell viability were evaluated by MTT assay.Results:Zingiberene treatment led to downregulation of miR-16 in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, accompanied by induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest targeting cyclin B1 as direct target. These effects were also accompanied by inhibition of cell migration and invasion, indicating that miR-16 can have a significant role as liver cancer suppressor after zingiberene treatment. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-16, which was one of HCC downregulated miRs, directly targeted Cyclin B1 in HCC cells.Conclusion:The current study indicates miR-16/cyclin B1 axis might have significant applications as a therapeutic target for patients with liver cancer.
