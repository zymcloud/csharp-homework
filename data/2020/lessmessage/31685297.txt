Introduction and aims:Cholangiocarcinoma accounts for 3% of gastrointestinal tumors and is the second most frequent hepatic neoplasia after hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary aim was to evaluate the median disease-free period and survival in patients with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis through the comparison of R0 and R1 resection margins.Material and methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted on 36 patients that underwent some type of surgical resection due to cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis, within the time frame of 2000-2017, at a center specializing in hepatopancreatobiliary surgery. Population, preoperative, and oncologic variables were included. The IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Mac, version 16.0, software (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was employed.Results:Thirty-one patients underwent hepatectomy, the Whipple procedure, or bypass surgery, depending on tumor location. The statistical significance of survival between patients with positive margins and those with negative margins was evaluated through the Mann-Whitney U test, with a PConclusions:No statistically significant difference in relation to the incidence of disease recurrence or general survival resulted from the comparison of microscopically positive surgical margins (R1) and negative surgical margins (R0). There was also no correlation between preoperative CA 19-9 levels and disease prognosis.
