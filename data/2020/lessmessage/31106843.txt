Background:The aim of the study was to investigate the changes of blood flow signal in residual cancer after ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment of rabbit liver cancer over time, and to analyse the correlation between changes in blood flow signal and changes in hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in residual cancer tissue after RFA.Materials and methods:One hundred and ten rabbits were randomly selected, VX2 tumour cells were implanted subcutaneously, tumour cells were implanted in liver. Ninety rabbits were divided into three groups: Group 1 - untreated controls, Group 2 - RFA group, Group 3 - surgical resection group. Tumour size, blood flow signal, microvessel density (MVD) in liver cancer were assessed.Results:Correlation of HIF-1a, VEGF, MMP-9 mRNA and protein expressions with blood flow signal in residual cancer were observed. Liver tumour was 2.3 ± 0.32 cm, significant differences in the grade of blood flow signal were noted among different time points (days 0, 3, 7, and 14; p Conclusions:There is a higher risk of tumour recurrence with RFA than with surgical resection.
