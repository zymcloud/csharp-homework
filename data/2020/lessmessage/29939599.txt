Chemoembolization is the technique of injecting chemotherapy medication into the feeding arteries of a tumor along with particles designed to slow or stop the further arterial supply of oxygen and nutrients to that tumor. It has been performed since the late 1970s., It is one of several techniques used with the goal of treating either primary liver cancer or cancer metastatic to the liver. The most common primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Common types of metastases to the liver include those from the colon, breast, carcinoid, soft tissue sarcomas, and melanoma. Arterial chemoembolization also can be termed transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).
