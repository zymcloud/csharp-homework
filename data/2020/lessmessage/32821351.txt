Aim:To estimate the cost per patient for hepatocellular carcinoma in Greece, a setting that is currently facing financial constraints.Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma patient management strategies are associated with significant costs. Despite this, patient level data on healthcare resource use and cost-of-illness analyses of hepatocellular carcinoma remain rather scarce in the international literature.Methods:123 patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma and followed in a specialised clinic of a tertiary hospital in Greece formed the basis of the analysis. Detailed resource use data were derived from the medical records of each patient. Data were recorded from the first encounter of the patient with the facility until a fatal endpoint or until the last day of follow up. Patients that were lost to follow-up were excluded from the analysis. Calculations follow a third-party payer perspective, according to official prices and tariffs.Results:The average cost per patient was estimated at 12,119.1 Euros (SD: 14,670.3) (21,375.1 PPP USD) for the average follow-up period and 10,241.5 Euros (18,063.5 PPP USD) per year. Median costs per month of follow-up according to underlying disease were 1,218.1, 1,376.8, 1,521.3 and 686.9 Euros (2,148.4, 2,428.3, 2,683.2 and 1,211.5 PPP USD) for patients with alcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, respectively.Conclusion:Hepatocellular carcinoma represents a heavy toll, both from the clinical as well as from the economic perspective, especially for a setting in "dire straits". Interventions towards reducing the incidence and, subsequently, the cost of HCC are imperative.
