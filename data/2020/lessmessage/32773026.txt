Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent pathology associated with obesity. It encompasses a spectrum of hepatic disorders ranging from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been widely involved to drive in NAFLD progression through the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). While transient UPR activation can boost hepatic ER functions, its continuous activation upon a chronic ER stress contributes to lipid accumulation, inflammation and hepatocyte death, which are determinant factors for the progression to more severe stages. The aim of this review is to describe the mechanisms through which the UPR can take part in the transition from a healthy to a diseased liver and to report on possible ways of pharmacological manipulation against these pathological mechanisms.
