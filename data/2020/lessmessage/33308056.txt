Aims:To investigate the feasibility of serum extra spindle pole bodies-like 1 (ESPL1) used as a biomarker for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:131 chronic HBV-infection patients were recruited and divided into HBV S gene integration, non-HBV S gene integration, chronic hepatitis B (CHB), HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) and HBV-related HCC group, 24 non-HBV-related HCC patients were selected as HCC control group, 30 people without HBV-infection as healthy control group. Serum ESPL1 were detected and compared.Results:ESPL1 level of integration group was significantly higher than that of non-integration group (346.7 vs 199.6 ng/ml, P = 0.000) and healthy control group (346.7 vs 41.3 ng/ml, P = 0.000). ESPL1 level of non-integration group was significantly higher than that of healthy control group (199.6 vs 41.3 ng/ml, P = 0.000); ESPL1 levels in chronic HBV-infection related groups were increased in turn according to CHB group (95.8 ng/ml), HBV-related LC group (268.2 ng/ml), HBV-related HCC group (279.9 ng/ml) and integration group (346.7 ng/ml). Except that there was no significant difference in ESPL1 levels between HBV-related LC and HCC group (P = 0.662), pairwise comparisons between other groups showed significant differences (P < 0.05). ESPL1 level of HBV-related HCC group was significantly higher than that of non-HBV-related HCC group (279.9 vs 46.6 ng/ml, P = 0.000), there was no noticeable difference between non-HBV-related HCC and healthy control group (46.6 vs 41.3 ng/ml, P = 0.848). ESPL1 level of HBV-related HCC group after resection was significantly lower than that of before resection (178.4 vs 260.8 ng/ml, P = 0.000).Conclusions:Chronic HBV-infection patients with high ESPL1 level may indicate HBV S gene integration and is a high-risk population for HBV-related HCC. Serum ESPL1 can be used as a biomarker for screening HBV-related HCC high-risk population and monitoring recurrence.
