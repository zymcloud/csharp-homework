AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) levels are increased during the development of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma); nonetheless, it can also be produced by non-tumoral hepatocytes in conditions of high cell turnover. Our study aims to provide additional data regarding the causes of elevated AFP in patients with liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We conducted an observational prospective cohort study that included 2068 patients with compensated cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b infection. The two main inclusion criteria were the presence of advanced liver fibrosis - Metavir stage F4 - diagnosed by FibroMax testing, Fibroscan or liver biopsy, and the presence of detectable HCV RNA in the serum. Plasmatic AFP levels were determined through the electrochemiluminescence method, with a standard value ranging from 0 to 7 ng/ml. All data were obtained from the Romanian National Health Agency. The average AFP serum levels in patients with compensated cirrhosis without HCC were 9.4 ng/ml (range 0.5 รท 406 ng/ml); 30.1% of patients had significantly increased levels of AFP (>15 ng/ml). High values of serum AFP in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis without HCC was correlated with more advanced age (p
