Background:The time-related variability of HCC biomarkers has not been investigated so far.Objective:To assess the changes of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin-K absence/antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) in patients with HCC (HCC+) as compared to patients without HCC (HCC-).Methods:AFP and PIVKA-II were measured by a single laboratory using an automated chemiluminescent-enzyme-immunoassay (Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo, Japan) in 1163 sera of 418 cirrhotics (31.1% HBV, 58.6% HCV, 10.3% non-viral etiology) undergoing ultrasound HCC surveillance. The mean (range) number of effective time-points available for analysis was 2.8 (2.0 to 3.0); 124 patients with HCC were matched with 294 who remained HCC free for at least 12 months after the last specimen. AFP and PIVKA-II changes were estimated over time by means of a random-effect generalized least squares (RE-GLS) regression model under the missingness at random assumption.Results:Patients with and without HCC had comparable chronic liver disease etiology and staging. AFP/PIVKA-II median (25th; 75th percentile) values at the latest time-point were 4.2 (2.6; 8.6) ng/mL/32 (25; 42) mAU/mL in HCC- and 8.4 (4.4; 32.1) ng/mL/66 (32; 192) mAU/mL in HCC+ (pConclusions:The present retrospective study of the biological variability of AFP and PIVKA-II suggests that their time-related changes may serve as potential predictors of HCC. This topic needs to be addressed by longitudinal studies.
