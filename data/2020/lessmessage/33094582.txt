Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has been the standard treatment for acute variceal bleeding (AVB). However, reports of long-term prognosis after EVL are scarce. Therefore, the current work aimed to investigate the long-term outcome and prognostic modifiers of cirrhotic cases presented with acute esophageal variceal bleeding and managed with EVL. The current prospective work comprised primarily 276 consecutive grown-up cirrhotic cases presenting with AVB and managed with EVL. Two-hundred patients who completed the study till death or 3-year follow-up were enrolled in final analysis. The primary outcome measure was occurrence of rebleeding and all-cause mortality. By the end of follow up 56 patients (28%) developed rebleeding and 78 (39%) died. The independent factors associated with rebleeding were lacking follow up EVL (OR: 4.8, 95%CI: 1.9-12.2), BMI > 30 kg/m2 (OR: 0.-, 95%CI: 0.2-0.9), Child class C (OR: 3.8, 95%CI: 1.8-7.8), and grade IV varices (OR: 2.6, 95%CI: 1.3-5.3). The independent factors associated with mortality were: Age > 65 years (OR: 32.4, 95%CI: 8.7-120.3), rebleeding (OR: 98.4, 95%CI: 27.9-347.0), coexistence of HCC (OR: 7.4, 95%CI: 2.0-27.4), and lacking follow up EVL (OR: 6.1, 95%CI: 1.2-31.1). Recurrent bleeding after emergency endoscopic ligation of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhotic cases is a rather common complication that significantly increases the mortality rate. The liver condition, lack of follow up endoscopy, old age, and severity of esophageal varices are independent prognostic indicator of rebleeding and morality.
