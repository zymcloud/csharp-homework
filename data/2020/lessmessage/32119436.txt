Hepatitis is defined as inflammation of the liver that can result from a variety of causes such as heavy alcohol use, autoimmune, drugs, or toxins. However, the most frequent cause of hepatitis is due to a viral infection and is referred to as viral hepatitis. In the United States, the most common types of viral hepatitis are Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C. The other types of viral hepatitis are hepatitis D and E and are less frequently encountered.. Based on the etiology of hepatitis, the severity can range from mild and self-limiting to severe illness requiring liver transplantation. Hepatitis can be further classified into acute and chronic based on the duration of the inflammation/insult to the liver. If inflammation of the liver lasts for less than 6 months, then it is termed as acute hepatitis and if it lasts longer than 6 months it is termed as chronic hepatitis. Acute hepatitis is usually self-resolving but can cause fulminant liver failure depending on the etiology. In contrast, chronic hepatitis can cause liver damage that includes liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and features of portal hypertension leading to significant morbidity and mortality.
