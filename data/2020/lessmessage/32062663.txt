Objective:Chemotherapy is generally recommended as the first-line standard treatment in patients with liver metastasis from gastric cancer. However, the clinical impact of surgical treatment remains unclear in responders after chemotherapy. The present study aimed to investigate the tumor response and prognosis after chemotherapy and to assess the clinical indication of conversion surgery in responders.Methods:The study retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 44 patients with liver metastasis from gastric cancer who were treated with chemotherapy between February 2002 and January 2019. These patients were classified into progressive disease (PD) and non-PD groups according to tumor response.Results:Among the 44 patients, 7 and 26 had peritoneal dissemination and ≥5 had metastatic liver nodules. Additionally, 15 and 29 patients had PD and non-PD, respectively. Surgical treatment was significantly correlated with tumor response (p < 0.0321). Prognostic differences between the PD and non-PD groups were significant (p < 0.0001). Moreover, gastrectomy and hepatectomy were significantly correlated with the number of liver metastases (≥5 vs. <5, respectively) in the non-PD group (p = 0.0025 and p = 0.0169, respectively). The 3-year survival rates among patients with non-PD undergoing both gastrectomy and hepatectomy (n = 6), gastrectomy alone (n = 7), and nonsurgical treatments (n = 16) were 100, 66.7, and 0%, respectively (p = 0.0026). Multivariate analysis identified peritoneal dissemination as an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.0225).Conclusion:Our preliminary results suggest that conversion surgery for gastric cancer with liver metastasis might be clinically indicated in chemotherapy responders with <5 metastatic liver nodules and without peritoneal dissemination.
