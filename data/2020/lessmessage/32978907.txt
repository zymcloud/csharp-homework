Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is widely prevalent globally and has no effective treatment. Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world and can therefore have a significant impact on public health on account of its health-promoting properties. Evidence from observational, clinical, and animal studies suggests that coffee may play an important role in human health. This article summarizes the effects of coffee on liver health, especially on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression: liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, this article describes the pathogenesis, prevalence, diagnosis, and nutrition guidelines relating to NAFLD. Possible mechanisms responsible for the effects of coffee on the liver are also suggested.
