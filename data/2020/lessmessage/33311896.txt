Background/purpose:Hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVR) is common in patients withcancer. The aim of the present study was to find out clinical profile of patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy with HBVR and to study the efficacy of entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir in the treatment of HBVR.Methods:This is a prospective study in which all consecutive patients with cancer with evidence of HBVR were included. HBVR was defined as: New onset transaminitis with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3 times upper limit of normal and >10 fold increase in HBV DNA levels from baseline levels or detection of HBV DNA â‰¥100,000 IU/ml in patients with no baseline HBV DNA. Patients with HBVR were put on ETV or tenofovir and were closely monitored for efficacy and safety for minimum of 1 year.Results:Of 204 Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients with different cancers, 92 met the inclusion criteria. Of 92, 46 received ETV 0.5 mg/day and 46 received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg/day. At 6 months, there was 4.7 log reduction in HBV DNA level in the ETV group and 5.2 log reduction in the TDF group (P = 0.029). Proportion of patients with undetectable HBV DNA (75.7% vs 87.5%), ALT normalization (89.2% Vs 87.5%), HBsAg negativity (25% vs 28.1%), and seroconversion (2.8% vs 3.1%) at 1 year were almost similar in both groups with P value > 0.05 for all efficacy end points. There was no HBVR-related mortality in any group.Conclusion:Both ETV and tenofovir are very effective in the treatment of HBVR and reduce the liver-related mortality and morbidity in such patients.
