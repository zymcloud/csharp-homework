Background/aim:Kinesin family member 15 (KIF15) participates in the transport of macromolecules in essential cellular processes. In this study we evaluated the clinical relevance of KIF15 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Association between KIF15 expression and clinical outcomes in HCC patients was analyzed using three independent cohorts. Localization of KIF15 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. Co-culture experiments were performed using healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and HCC cell lines.Results:Immunohistochemical analysis showed that KIF15 was mainly expressed in inflammatory monocytes around cancer cells. Multivariate analysis indicated high KIF15 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for survival. HCC cells with high expression of minichromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM2) were located close to KIF15-expressing inflammatory monocytes. The proliferation ability of HCC cells was increased by co-culture with PBMC.Conclusion:High KIF15 expression in inflammatory monocytes in tumor tissues may serve as a prognostic marker for poor outcome in HCC.
