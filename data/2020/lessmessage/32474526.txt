Aims:The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and clinical value of computed tomography (CT)-guided125 I brachytherapy for pain palliation in patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases.Materials and methods:A total of 23 patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases and those who had moderate-to-severe pain from January 2014 to December 2018 were enrolled in the study. The primary tumors included pancreatic (n = 12), gastric (n = 4), hepatocellular (n = 4), colorectal (n = 2), and esophageal carcinomas (n= 1). Patients were treated with CT-guided percutaneous125 I brachytherapy during the study. The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form was used to record and compare pain intensity and interference by pain. Treatment-related complications were also evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 22.0.Results:The primary success rate of125 I seed implantation was 95.7% (22 of the 23 patients). As pain evolved, the patients achieved obvious pain palliation ratings for "worst pain" and "average pain" at 72 h and 4 weeks after brachytherapy, respectively, whereas "pain right now" at 12 weeks was significantly relieved after brachytherapy. No serious complications developed during the perioperative period.Conclusions:In the treatment of intractable carcinomatous pain in patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, CT-guided125 I brachytherapy is a feasible and effective modality for pain palliation.
