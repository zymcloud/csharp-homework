Purpose: To determine the effectiveness of ablation for pulmonary metastases (PM) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods: Between 2010 and 2017, the study analyzed 39 patients who had a median age of 59 years. Primary HCC was under control and the number of PM was less than 5 (median: 2), with a maximum diameter of ≤60 mm (median: 15 mm). The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS). Secondary endpoints included technique success (TS), complication and tumor response. TS referred to PM treated using the treatment protocol. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model was conducted on the potential risk factors (univariate: p < 0.5) to determine the independent factors (multivariate: p < 0.05).Results: The TS rate was 100%. Major complications included pneumothorax (n = 3) requiring chest tube placement and pleural effusion requiring drainage (n = 2). Complete ablation was achieved in 32/38 patients (valid percent: 84.2%) at 1 month after ablation. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 79.8, 58 and 30.9%, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year LTPFS rates were 60.7, 34.2 and 22.8%, respectively. The extent (unilateral vs. bilateral) of PM (hazard ratio (HR): 0.197, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.043-0.890, p = 0.035) and the number (≤2 vs. >2) of PM (HR: 0.555, 95% CI: 0.311-0.991, p = 0.047) were found to be the independent risk factors for predicting OS.Conclusion: Percutaneous thermal ablation is a safe and effective treatment for PM from HCC.
