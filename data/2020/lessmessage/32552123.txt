Objective: To explore various microwave (MW) time/power combinations to achieve maximum single-probe system performance in a live pig liver model.Methods: Fifty-one microwave ablations performed in 12 female pigs using the following time/power combinations: 65 W for 10 min (65W 10MIN), ramped from 20 to 65 W (RAMPED), 95 W pulses with cooling periods (95W PULSED), 40 W for 16 min 15 s (LOW POWER), 1 min 95 W pulse then 8 min 65 W then a second 1 min 95 W pulse (BOOKEND 95W) and 65 W for 15 min (65W 15MIN). Temperatures 1.5 cm from the antenna were measured. Livers were excised, and ablations were measured and compared.Results: At fixed overall energy, LOW POWER produced ablation zones with the smallest volume compared to 65W 10MIN, RAMPED and 95W PULSED. At a fixed time of 10-min, BOOKEND 95W protocol achieved wider and larger ablation zones than 65W 10MIN (p = 0.038, p = 0.008) and 95W PULSED (p = 0.049, p = 0.004). The 65W 15MIN combination had significantly larger diameters (p = 0.026), larger lengths (p = 0.014) and larger volumes (p = 0.005) versus 65W 10MIN. Maximum temperatures were highest with BOOKEND 95W (62.9 °C) and 65 W 15 MIN (63.0 °C) and lowest with LOW POWER (45.9 °C), p = 0.009.Conclusions: Low power ablations, even if controlled for total energy delivery, create small ablation zones. High peak powers are associated with larger ablation zones and high margin temperatures if cooling pauses are avoided. Ramping and pulsing protocols with interleaved cooling appear to be of no benefit versus continuous 65 W for creating large ablation zones.
