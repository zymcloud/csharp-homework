Taurocholic acid (TCA), a conjugation of cholic acid with taurine, is one of the main bile acids that is elevated in liver disease. Considering the epidemiologic linkage of periodontal disease to liver disease, the question arises about the possible effect of elevated TCA levels on periodontal cells. To answer this question, gingival fibroblasts and human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line (HSC-2) were pretreated with interleukine1β (IL1β) and tumor necrosis factorα (TNFα) in the presence and absence of TCA. Also, mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) were incubated with sterile-filtered human saliva with and without TCA. Inflammatory cytokines were measured by real time polynucleotide chain reaction (RT-PCR) and an immunoassay. The nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit was visualized by immunostaining. In pretreated gingival fibroblasts and HSC-2 cells, TCA considerably reduced the expression of IL1β, IL6, and IL8. In support of these observations, TCA lowered the saliva-induced expression of IL1α, IL1β and IL6 in RAW 264.7 cells. An immunoassay confirmed the capacity of TCA to diminish inflammation-induced expression of IL6 in gingival fibroblasts, HSC-2 and RAW 264.7 cells. Consistently, TCA blocked the nuclear translocation of p65 in fibroblasts. These findings suggest that TCA has anti-inflammatory activity in gingival fibroblasts, human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells and macrophages in vitro.
