Liver cancer is the fifth (6.3% of all cancers i.e., 548,000 cases/year) and ninth (2.8% of all cancers i.e., 244,000 cases/year) most prevalent cancer worldwide in men and women, respectively. Although multiple choices of therapies are offered for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) like liver resection or transplant, radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, radioembolization, and systemic targeted agent, by the time of diagnosis, most of the cases of HCC are in an advanced stage, which renders therapies like liver transplant or resection and local ablation impractical; and targeted therapy has its shortcomings like general toxicity, imprecise selectivity, several adversative reactions, and resistance development. Therefore, novel drugs with specificity and selectivity are needed to provide the potential therapeutic response. Various researches have shown the potential of phytomedicines in liver cancer by modulating cell growth, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis. However, their therapeutic potential is held up by their unfavorable properties like stability, poor water solubility, low absorption, and quick metabolism. Nonetheless, the advancement of nanotechnology-based innovative nanocarrier formulations has improved the phytomedicines' profile to be used in the treatment of liver cancer. Nanocarriers not only improve the solubility and stability of phytomedicines but also extend their residence in plasma and accomplish specificity. In this review, we summarize the advancements introduced by nanotechnology in the treatment of liver cancer. In particular, we discuss quite a few applications of nanophytomedicines like curcumin, quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, berberine, apigenin, triptolide, and resveratrol in liver cancer treatment.
