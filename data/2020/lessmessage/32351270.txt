Myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a common imaging procedure in nuclear medicine laboratories may encompass findings in the heart or beyond it, in the thorax or abdomen, which may be related or unrelated to the symptoms of the patients. Sometimes, these findings may be discovered incidentally. In the present article, it is aimed to present some less frequent cardiac and extracardiac findings including radiolabeled emboli, transposition of great arteries, breast prosthesis, breast tissue uptake, pericardial effusion, hiatal hernia, hepatocellular carcinoma, ascites, aortic aneurysm, splenomegaly, and polycystic kidney disease during 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile myocardial perfusion SPECT with their radiological correlates.
99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile; cardiac and extracardiac findings; myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography.
