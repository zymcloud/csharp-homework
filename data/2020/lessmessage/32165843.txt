Renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid features is a rare presentation with a 5% incidence. Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma is usually associated with poor prognosis. It commonly metastasizes to the lungs, bones, and liver. Dermatological manifestation with paraneoplastic syndrome is extremely rare. Pathogenesis of PNP in renal cell carcinoma is not cleat; till date, however, few literature suggest antibodies against a group plakin family which plays a key role in intermediate filament attachment in RCC. We present PNP in a 64-year-old female associated with renal cell carcinoma.
Paraneoplastic; pemphigus; sarcomatoid.
