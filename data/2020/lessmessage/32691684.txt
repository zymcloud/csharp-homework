The aim of this study is to investigate the role of microRNA-499 (miR-499) in hepatocellular carcinoma tumor growth and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The expression of miR-499 was significantly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, miR-499 overexpression in HEPG2 cell was related to the tumor growth in nude mice xenograft models. Likewise, miR-499 mimic or inhibitor decreased or accelerated cell proliferation, respectively. Mechanistically, miR-499 directly targeted the 3'- untranslated region of astrocyte elevated gene-1 and downregulate astrocyte elevated gene-1 expression. Restoration of astrocyte elevated gene-1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-499 on cell growth. In addition, astrocyte elevated gene-1 and miR-499 expression were inversely correlated in human and mice hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Our study identified miR-499 as a tumor-suppressive miR in hepatocellular carcinoma, thus providing a candidate therapeutic target for the future diagnosis or treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
