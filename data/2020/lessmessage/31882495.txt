Background/aim:The calcium-binding protein S100A14 is involved in processes related to tumorigenesis and tumor propagation, such as proliferation, apoptosis, motility and invasiveness. Our aim was to investigate its role in colorectal cancer.Patients and methods:One hundred and seven patients (65 men and 42 women) were included in this study. They had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer and undergone complete resection of their primary tumor. Tissue samples from archival blocks of their normal and malignant colorectal tissues were used for immunohistochemical assessment of S100A14 expression. S100A14 levels were evaluated using image analysis and associated with various clinicopathological parameters and prognosis.Results:S100A14 expression was reduced in malignant tissues when compared to normal intestinal mucosa in cases of T3-T4 tumors (p=0.017). Moreover, as far as S100A14 levels in malignant tissues are concerned, they were lower in T3-T4 tumors (p=0.001), N2 disease (p=0.034) and M1 disease (p=0.019). Finally, very high S100A14 production (>75th percentile) was associated with shorter disease-specific (HR=3.584, p=0.045) and relapse-free survival (HR=4.527, p=0.007) in multivariate survival analysis.Conclusion:S100A14 expression is decreased in advanced colorectal cancer. However, cases with very high S100A14 levels have a worse survival.
