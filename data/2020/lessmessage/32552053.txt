Some patients with cancer use adjunctive Chinese medicine, which might improve the quality of life. This study aims to investigate the effects and relative factors of adjunctive Chinese medicine on survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients at different stages. The study population was 23 581 newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma patients and received surgery from 2004 to 2010 in Taiwan. After propensity score matching with a ratio of 1:10, this study included 1339 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who used adjunctive Chinese medicine and 13 390 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who used only Western medicine treatment. All patients were observed until the end of 2012. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model was applied to find the relative risk of death between these 2 groups. The study results show that the relative risk of death was lower for patients with adjunctive Chinese medicine treatment than patients with only Western medicine treatment (hazard ratio = 0.68; 95% confidence interval = 0.62-0.74). The survival rates of patients with adjunctive Chinese medicine or Western medicine treatment were as follows: 1-year survival rate: 83% versus 72%; 3-year survival rate: 53% versus 44%; and 5-year survival rate: 40% versus 31%. The factors associated with survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients included treatment, demographic characteristics, cancer stage, health status, physician characteristics, and characteristics of primary medical institution. Moreover, stage I and stage II hepatocellular carcinoma patients had better survival outcome than stage III patients by using adjunctive Chinese medicine therapy. The effect of adjunctive Chinese medicine was better on early-stage disease.
