Purpose:To evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and treatment outcomes of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the application of intrahepatic recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (r-HCC) after liver transplantation (LT).Methods:From April 2008 to December 2019, a total of 37 patients (34 male and 3 female, mean age: 48.7 Â± 10.5 years) with 61 r-HCCs after LT treated by RFA as a first-line option were enrolled. The technical success, recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) and complications were evaluated.Results:After the first session of RFA, three patients were detected with residual foci. All of them received additional session of RFA and two tumors were successfully ablated. Therefore, the technical success was 97.3% (36/37). During the follow-up period, a total of 7 tumors developed local tumor progression (LTP) after 2.2-10.8 months. The LTP rate was 11.7% for r-HCC in the transplanted liver. The median RFS was 4.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.2-7.3 months). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year cumulative OS rates were 68.5%, 40.3%, and 40.3%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that tumor size was the only independent predictor for RFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.557, 95% CI, 1.015-6.444; p = .046) and limited extrahepatic metastasis was the only independent prognostic factors of OS after RFA for post-LT r-HCC (HR = 4.031, 95%CI, 1.218-13.339; p = .022). Major complications after RFA occurred in two patients (2/37, 5.4%).Conclusion:Percutaneous RFA is safe and effective for intrahepatic r-HCC after LT, especially for those without limited extrahepatic metastasis.
