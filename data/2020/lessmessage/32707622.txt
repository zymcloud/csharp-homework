Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours (IMTs) are rare lesions. We report a case of a 55 year-old male, admitted with a pneumonia. Further investigation revealed a left lower lobe mass and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage suggested a squamous cell carcinoma. He received four cycles of chemotherapy followed by a left lower lobectomy. Pathological analysis was compatible with IMT. Three months after surgery, a new IMT nodule located in the lingula was excised. Four months later,endobronchial involvement and the presence of liver nodules were detected.Ten months after the first surgery a CT revealed a sacrum lesion. Histology was compatible with undifferentiated sarcoma and a sarcomatous transformation was assumed.
