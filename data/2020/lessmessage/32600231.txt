The majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at an advanced stage that can only benefit from systemic treatments. Although HCC is highly treatmentresistant, significant achievements have been made in the molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy of HCC. In addition to regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab were approved for the second- line targeted treatment by the FDA after disease progression on sorafenib. Nivolumab failed to demonstrate remarkable benefit in overall survival (OS) as first-line therapy, while pembrolizumab did not achieve pre-specified statistical significance in both OS and progression-free survival (PFS) as second-line treatment. Combinations of targeted agents, immune checkpoint inhibitors and other interventions showed favorable results. In this review, we summarized the progress of systemic therapy in HCC and discussed the future directions of the treatment of HCC.
