The aim of the present study was to evaluate the underlying mechanism of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) induced cellular response and their potential cross-talk, specifically, between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, MAPK activation and apoptosis and how these nano-bio interactions depend on the physico-chemical properties of MWCNT. For this purpose, human bronchial epithelial (Beas2B) and human hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines, were exposed to five kinds of MWCNTs which differ in functionalization and aspect ratios. Tissue-specific sensitivity was evident for calcium homeostasis, ER-stress response, MAPK activation and apoptosis, which further depended on surface functionalization as well as aspect ratios of MWCNT. By applying specific pharmaceutical inhibitors, relevant biomarkers gene and proteins expressions, we found that possibly MWCNT induce activation of IRE1Î±-XPB1 pathway-mediated ER-stress response, which in turn trigger apoptosis through JNK activation in both type of cells but with variable intensity. The information presented here would have relevance in better understanding of MWCNT toxicity and their safer applications.
