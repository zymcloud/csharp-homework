Background/aim:Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is still one of the serious health problems worldwide, despite the existence of effective vaccines for HAV. Zinc compounds have antiviral activities against various DNA and RNA viruses. Therefore, we investigated the effects of zinc compounds on the antiviral activity of interferon against HAV.Materials and methods:The effects of zinc compounds with or without interferon on HAV genotype IIIA HA11-1299 replication were examined in human hepatoma Huh7 cells. Cell viability was examined by the MTS assay. Inflammasome associated gene expression was examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.Results:Both zinc sulfate and zinc chloride had an inhibitory effect on HAV replication. Zinc sulfate tended to enhance while zinc chloride significantly enhanced the anti-HAV effect induced by interferon-alpha-2a. Zinc chloride significantly up-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase 12 (MAPK12) and down-regulated 6 related genes [baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (BIRC3), interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), PYD and CARD domain containing (PYCARD), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)].Conclusion:Zinc chloride inhibits HAV replication and has additive effects on the anti-HAV activities of interferon.
