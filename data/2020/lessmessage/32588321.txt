In this chapter, we discuss the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in the establishment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), highlighting the key role of the multiple, non-mutually exclusive, pathways involved in the modulation of immune responses and in the orchestration of a chronic low-level inflammation state favouring HCC development. In particular, we discuss (i) HCC as a classical paradigm of inflammation-linked cancer; (ii) the role of the most relevant inflammatory cytokines involved (i.e. IL-6, TNF-α, IL-18, IL-1β, TGF-β IL-10); (iii) the role of T cell exhaustion by immune checkpoints; (iv) the role of the Wnt3a/β-catenin signalling pathway and (v) the role of different subsets of suppressor cells.
