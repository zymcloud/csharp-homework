Goals:The main purpose of this study was to assess the recent trends in mortality and health care utilization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among Medicare population in the United States.Background:The incidence of HCC is increasing in the United States.Materials and methods:Data were obtained for a sample of Medicare beneficiary from 2005 to 2014. Diagnosis of HCC and etiology of liver disease were based on ICD-9 codes. Temporal trends in HCC rates, clinical, demographical and utilization parameters were analyzed by joinpoint regression model.Results:Study cohort included 13,648 Medicare recipients with HCC (mean age: 70.0 y, 62.8% male and 76.0% white). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was the most common cause of HCC in the inpatient (32.07%) and outpatient (20.22%) followed by hepatitis C virus (HCV) (19.2% and 9.75%, respectively). Between 2005 and 2014, HCC rate per 100,000 Medicare recipients increased from 46.3 to 62.8 [average annual percentage change (AAPC) =3.4%, PConclusions:Although HCC rates are increasing, the overall mortality is decreasing. NAFLD is the most important cause of HCC and an independent predictor of HCC in the outpatient setting for Medicare patients with HCC.
