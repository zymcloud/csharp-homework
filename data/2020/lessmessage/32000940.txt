Background:Screening for neoplastic lesions is mandatory as a part of the evaluation process of potential candidates for liver transplant (LT). This work aimed at identifying the main findings in screening colonoscopy and their risk factors.Methods:Endoscopic and pathologic findings of the biopsied lesions of 311 potential candidates for living donor liver transplant were collected and analyzed.Results:Colorectal polyps (8.7%) were the most common colonoscopic finding, of which 4.18% were diagnosed as adenomas. Other findings included hemorrhoids (7.7%), portal hypertensive colopathies (3.5%), angiomatous malformations (2.6%), rectal varices (1.6%), and diverticulosis (1.6%). The univariate analysis revealed that the prevalence of colonic adenoma was significant in patients 50 years and older (P = .03; odds ratio, 1.178; 95% CI, 1.016-1.365) and in patients who had hepatocellular carcinoma (P = .043; odds ratio, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.002-42.172). In the multivariate analysis, age was found to be the single best predictor of the presence of adenoma (P = .044; odds ratio, 1.178; 95% CI, 1.005-1.382).Conclusion:We can conclude that a screening colonoscopy prior to liver donor liver transplant should be performed at least in every LT candidate 50 years or older. Colonic polyps were the most common findings on screening colonoscopy prior to LT.
