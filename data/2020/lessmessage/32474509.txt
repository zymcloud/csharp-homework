Context and aims:Apatinib combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has shown promising results in cases of Barcelona clinic liver cancer Stage C (BCLC C) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of TACE in combination with microwave ablation (MWA) and apatinib.Materials and methods:A retrospective, single.center study was undertaken using a one.to.one propensity score matching (PSM) analysis design and involved BCLC C HCC patients who underwent treatment with TACE.MWA.apatinib or TACE alone between January 2013 and June 2018. The patients were recommended to administer 500mg apatinib per day, combined with MWA and TACE. The adverse effects of apatinib, MWA. and TACE.related complications, progression.free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed.Results:Of the 149 patients with BCLC C HCC who underwent TACE.MWA.apatinib or TACE alone, 131 were included in our study. Among them, 21 (16.0%) received TACE.MWA.apatinib and 110 (84.0%) underwent TACE alone. After PSM, twenty pairs were enrolled into different treatment groups. Patients in the TACE.MWA.apatinib group had a significantly longer median PFS than patients in the TACE.alone group on both before (median, 8.9 vs. 1.7 months, P = 0.0002) and after PSM (median, 5.4 vs. 2.1 months, P = 0.001). They also had a significantly longer median OS than patients in the TACE.alone group on before (median, 24.4 vs. 5.8 months, P = 0.000007) and after PSM (median, 24.4 vs. 5.4 months, P = 0.00005).Conclusions:The combination of apatinib, TACE, and MWA in BCLC C HCC patients is safe and effective. Toxicity is manageable by adjusting the apatinib dosage.
