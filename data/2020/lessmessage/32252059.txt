Objective:This study was conducted to investigate whether polymorphisms in glycolysis-related genes are associated with clinical outcomes of patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing chemotherapy.Methods:A total of 377 patients with NSCLC were enrolled. Sixty-five single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 26 genes involved in the glycolytic pathway were evaluated. The associations of the variants with the chemotherapy response and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.Results:Among the 65 variants investigated, PFKL rs2073436C>G and GPI rs7248411C>G significantly correlated with clinical outcomes after chemotherapy in multivariate analyses. PFKL rs2073436C>G was significantly associated with both a worse response to chemotherapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.45-0.90, p = 0.01) and a worse OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.14-1.61, p = 0.001). GPI rs7248411C>G was significantly associated with both a better chemotherapy response (aOR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.07-2.23, p = 0.02) and a better OS (aHR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66-0.98, p = 0.03). When stratified by tumor histology, PFKL rs2073436C>G was significantly associated with OS only in squamous cell carcinoma, whereas GPI rs7248411C>G exhibited a significant association with the chemotherapy response and OS only in adenocarcinoma.Conclusion:This result suggests that the PFKL rs2073436C>G and GPI rs7248411C>G are useful for predicting the clinical outcome of first-line paclitaxel-cisplatin chemotherapy in NSCLC.
