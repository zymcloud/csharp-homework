Renal cell carcinoma, of which clear cell carcinoma is the most common histological subtype (80 to 90 percent), comprises 90 percent of all Kidney tumors. Traditional morphological classification of these tumors divides them into three main subtypes – clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe subtypes. Clear cell and papillary cell cancer originate from the proximal tubular cells, while chromophobe cell cancers originate from the intercalated cells. The percentage of distant metastases in these various subtypes varies from 15 percent in clear cell carcinoma to 3 percent in papillary and 4 percent in chromophobe cell cancers. The cancer-specific 10-year survival ranges from 71 percent in clear cell cancer to 91 percent in papillary cancer, 88 percent in chromophobe cancer, and 33 percent in collecting duct cancers. As is expected, diagnosis at an earlier stage offers a relatively higher chance of cure. The goals of the management of advanced RCC emphasize a focus upon improvement in the quality of life parameters.Clear cell tumors have the propensity to spread hematogenous, with direct extension into the major vessels – namely the renal veins and the inferior vena cava. Lung, bone, brain, liver, lymph nodes, liver, and adrenal glands form the main sites of dissemination. Lytic bony metastases, which might become sclerotic with treatment, can be present. Clear cell carcinoma is considered uniformly metastatic, irrespective of the tumor size.
