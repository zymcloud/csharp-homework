Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare cancer of the liver and it displays features that make it very different in its behavior and clinical findings from conventional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). FL-HCC accounts for a negligible percentage of primary liver cancers (1%). Patients affected by FL-HCC are usually in a lower age group as opposed to HCC. The presenting complaints, blood tests, radiological evaluation and treatment strategies are different from HCC. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate care plans play a very important role in this disease entity, which eventually affects the outcome. This article aims at reviewing the salient features of FL-HCC, comparing it to HCC.
