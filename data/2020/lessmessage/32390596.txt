Background:Effective prognostic biomarkers and powerful target-therapeutic drugs are needed for improving the treatment of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objective:This study aimed to evaluate the expression of FOXM1 and Aurora-A and their prognostic value in HCC.Methods:We determined the differentially expressed genes signature in HCC using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and then evaluated the expression of FOXM1 and Aurora-A in TCGA and KMUH cohort. Associations between co-expression of FOXM1 and Aurora-A and clinical variables were calculated. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were estimated with different FOXM1 and Aurora-A expression status.Results:FOXM1-related gene sets were mostly associated with cell cycle regulation in HCC tissues. We found a positive correlation between the expression of FOXM1 and Aurora-A. Overexpression of FOXM1 and Aurora-A was associated with larger tumor size, advanced stage, higher grade, and double-positive for HBV and HCV. The coordinated overexpression of FOXM1 and Aurora-A was the most significant independent prognostic factor for OS and RFS. Furthermore, the concomitant high expression of FOXM1 and Aurora-A predicted the worst OS of sorafenib-treated patients with HCC.Conclusions:The co-expression of FOXM1 and Aurora-A could be a reliable biomarker to predict the sorafenib response and prognosis of HCC patients.
