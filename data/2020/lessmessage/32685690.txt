Worldwide, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has reached epidemic proportions and in parallel, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become one of the fastest growing cancers. Epidemiological studies have not only shed light on the prevalence and incidence of the disease but have also unmasked important environmental risk factors, including the role of diabetes and dyslipidemia in disease pathogenesis. Genetic association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms implicated in NAFLD-HCC, many of which are part of lipid metabolism pathways. Through these clinical studies and subsequently, translational and basic research, the role of statins as a chemoprotective agent has also emerged with ongoing clinical trials assessing their utility in HCC prevention and treatment. In this review, we summarize the recent epidemiological studies describing the burden of NAFLD-HCC in different patient populations and countries. We discuss the genetic and environmental risk factors for NAFLD-HCC and highlight the chemoprotective role of statins and aspirin. We also summarize what is known about NAFLD-HCC in the cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis populations and briefly address the role of surveillance in NAFLD-HCC patients.
