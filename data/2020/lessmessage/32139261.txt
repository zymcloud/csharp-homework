Systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is recommended for patients with advanced stage and for those who progressed on locoregional modalities. The first agent approved for advanced HCC was sorafenib, and it remains one of the cornerstones of systemic treatment. In the past years, immunotherapy has shown promising results and has been incorporated into the treatment armamentarium. The rates of recurrence and progression after locoregional therapies are significant, what highlights the need to explore systemic agents for preventing or delaying these negative outcomes. Recently, sorafenib was shown to benefit patients with unresectable HCC under transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) by delaying tumor progression and prolonging time to vascular invasion and extrahepatic spread. Although this result was reported in patients with intermediate stage, it provides background to test the strategy of combining systemic treatment plus TACE as a bridge therapy to HCC patients awaiting liver transplantation, for which the risk of dropout due to tumor progression impairs the possibility of cure.
