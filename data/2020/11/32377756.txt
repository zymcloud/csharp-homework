This essay aimed to illustrate the various hepatic nodules that may exhibit arterial phase hyperenhancement and washout on computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI). Hepatic nodules with arterial phase hyperenhancement and washout on CT/MRI include hepatocellular carcinoma, focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules, serum amyloid A-positive hepatocellular neoplasms, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, intrahepatic bile duct adenoma, hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular adenoma, hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma, and metastasis including neuroendocrine and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Understanding the imaging findings is important to ensure correct diagnosis.
