Conventional selection criteria for liver transplantation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on tumour size and number alone, do not consider vital surrogates of tumor biology like alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and tumour FDG-18 PET avidity. We follow an expanded selection criteria for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in patients with cirrhosis and HCC (HCC-cirr): no extrahepatic disease, no major vascular invasion, irrespective of tumour size and number. We analyzed survival outcomes in 405 HCC-cirr patients (51% beyond Milan, 43% beyond UCSF criteria), and predictors of HCC recurrence. The 5-yr overall (OS) and recurrence-free (RFS) were 64% and 70%, respectively. Recurrence rate in 300 patients (excluding postoperative deaths, and those with deficient preoperative data) was 17.6%, with 3 preoperatively available factors predicting worse RFS; pre-LT AFP ≥100 ng/ml (p=0.005, HR:2.190), tumour burden beyond UCSF criteria (p=0.001, HR:2.640), and FDG-18 PET avidity (p=0.004, HR:2.442). Tumour FDG-18 PET avidity and AFP ≥100 mg/ml predicted OS. A prognostic model based on the number of, and combination of the above pre operative risk factors for recurrence, was developed using a competing-risk RFS model, and helped stratify patients into 3 risk groups: low risk (none or a single risk factor present, 9.3% recurrence), moderate risk (AFP≥100 ng/ml and FDG-18 PET avidity, or beyond UCSF tumour and FDG-18 PET avidity, 25% recurrence), and high risk (AFP≥100 ng/ml and beyond UCSF, or presence of all 3 risk factors, 46% recurrence). Conclusion: Acceptable post-LDLT long term outcomes were achieved using our expanded selection criteria. Our prognostic model to predict recurrence based on pre operative biological and morphological factors could guide pre-transplant management (downstaging vs. upfront LDLT), with the aim of reducing post-LDLT recurrence.
