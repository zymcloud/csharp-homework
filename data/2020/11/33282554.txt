Background:Altered glycosylation of proteins contributes to tumor progression. Dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS), an essential mannosyltransferase, plays a central role in post-translational modification of proteins, including N-linked glycoproteins, O-mannosylation, C-mannosylation and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors synthesis. Little is known about the function of DPMS in liver cancer.Methods:The study explored the roles of DPMS in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma using UALCAN, Human Protein Atlas, GEPIA, cBioPortal and Metascape databases. The mRNA expressions of DPM1/2/3 also were detected by quantitative real-time PCR experiments in vitro.Results:The transcriptional and proteinic expressions of DPM1/2/3 were both over-expressed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Over-expressions of DPMS were discovered to be dramatically associated with clinical cancer stages and pathological tumor grades in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. In addition, higher mRNA expressions of DPM1/2/3 were found to be significantly related to shorter overall survival in liver cancer patients. Futhermore, high genetic alteration rate of DPMS (41%) was also observed in patients with liver cancer, and genetic alteration in DPMS was associated with shorter overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. We also performed quantitative real-time PCR experiments in human normal hepatocytes and hepatoma cells to verify the expressions of DPM1/2/3 and results showed that the expression of DPM1 was significantly increased in hepatoma cells SMMC-7721 and HepG2.Conclusions:Taken together, these results suggested that DPM1 could be a potential prognostic biomarker for survivals of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
