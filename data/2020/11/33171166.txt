Suspect has been directed towards some direct acting antivirals (DAAs) due to their reported association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. The mechanisms behind HCC development, following CHC treatment, were not well understood and may be linked to genetic variabilities in different patients which affect several cytokine productions involved in angiogenesis and inflammation. Of these variabilities, is the genetic polymorphisms in the interleukin-17 (IL-17) A receptor gene. Being an important pleiotropic cytokine, this study aimed to investigate the association between haplotypes in IL-17A receptor rs2275913 and rs3819024 and development of HCC in CHC patients treated with either triple therapy (sofosbuvir (SOF), pegylated interferon-alpha-2a (Peg-IFNα-2a) & ribavirin(RBV)) or with dual therapy (Peg-IFNα-2a&RBV). A cohort of 100 CHC patients was recruited in this study. Samples were tested for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in IL-17A receptor (rs2275913 and rs3819024) using TaqMan Genotyping assay. Our results showed that the presence of G-G haplotype in IL-17A (rs2275913& rs3819024) is inversely associated with HCC development in patients receiving triple therapy. While, high serum AFP levels are directly associated with HCC development in patients receiving triple therapy. However, in patients receiving dual therapy, HCC development was only associated with high serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels and was not correlated to any specific allele in our studied SNPs. Such results highlight the importance of IL17A receptor gene haplotyping in the prediction of HCC development in patients receiving triple therapy. These results will aid in performing tailored, personalized strategy for CHC treatment.
