Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a highly conserved protein that accumulated in the tumorigenesis of various malignancies. Despite the important role of TCTP protein in tumor progression, the precise function and underlying mechanistic regulation of TCTP mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In this study, we found that TCTP protein was overexpressed in HCC patients but TCTP mRNA expression levels were reversed. TCTP knockout HCC cells exhibited attenuated abilities of proliferation, migration, and invasion. The knockdown of TCTP by siRNA effectively reduced TCTP mRNA levels but not protein levels in HCC cells. Moreover, although the constitutive knockdown of TCTP inhibited almost 80% of TCTP protein expression levels in tumors of wildtype transgenic mice (TCTP KD/WT), partial restoration of TCTP protein expression was observed in the tumors of heterozygous TCTP mice (TCTP KD/TCTPÂ±). The blockage of mRNA synthesis with ActD stimulated TCTP protein expression in HCC cells. In contrast, combined treatment with ActD and CHX or MG132 treatment alone did not lead to the TCTP protein accumulation in cells. Furthermore, following the introduction of exogenous TCTP in cells and orthotopic HCC tumor models, the endogenous TCTP protein did not change with the recombinational TCTP expression and kept a rather stable level. Dual-luciferase assays revealed that the coding sequence of TCTP mRNA functions as a sponge to regulate the TCTP protein expression. Collectively, our results indicated that the TCTP mRNA and protein formed a closed regulatory circuit and works as a buffering system to keep the homeostasis of TCTP protein levels in HCC.
