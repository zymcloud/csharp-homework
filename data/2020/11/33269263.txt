Background:Pancreatic panniculitis is an extremely rare condition associated with different underlying pancreatic disorders and characterized by subcutaneous fat necrosis induced by elevated serum lipase levels. These lesions usually affect the lower extremities and may precede abdominal symptoms of pancreatic disease. Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) of the pancreas is a rare pancreatic neoplasm, accounting for only 1%-2% of pancreatic tumors in adults.Case summary:We present the case of a 72-year-old man with ACC of the pancreatic head and synchronous liver metastases. Both the primary tumor and liver metastases were resected. Serum lipase was elevated before surgery and decreased to normal postoperatively. Rising serum lipase levels at follow-up led to the diagnosis of hepatic recurrence. This disease progression was then accompanied by pancreatic panniculitis, with subcutaneous fat necrosis and acute arthritis. To the best of our knowledge, only 4 cases have been reported in the literature and each showed a similar association of serum lipase levels with pancreatic panniculitis and progression of ACC.Conclusion:Clinical symptoms and progression of ACC may correlate with serum lipase levels, suggesting potential usefulness as a follow-up biomarker.
