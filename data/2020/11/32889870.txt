Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate tumor recurrence after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with and without hypothermic oxygenated liver perfusion (HOPE) before transplantation.Patients and methods:We analyzed all liver recipients with HCC, transplanted between January 2012 and September 2019 with donation after circulatory death (DCD) livers after previous end-ischemic HOPE-treatment (n = 70, Center A). Tumor parameters and key confounders were compared to consecutive recipients with HCC, transplanted during the same observation period with an unperfused DBD liver (n = 70). In a next step, we analyzed unperfused DCD (n = 70) and DBD liver recipients (n = 70), transplanted for HCC at an external center (Center B).Results:Tumor parameters were not significantly different between HOPE-treated DCD and unperfused DBD liver recipients at Center A. One-third of patients were outside established tumor thresholds, for example, Milan criteria, in both groups. Despite no difference in tumor load, we found a 4-fold higher tumor recurrence rate in unperfused DBD livers (25.7%, 18/70), compared to only 5.7% (n = 4/70) recipients with tumor recurrence in the HOPE-treated DCD cohort (P = 0.002) in Center A. The tumor recurrence rate was also twice higher in unperfused DCD and DBD recipients at the external Center B, despite significant less cases outside Milan. HOPE-treatment of DCD livers resulted therefore in a 5-year tumor-free survival of 92% in HCC recipients, compared to 73%, 82.7%, and 81.2% in patients receiving unperfused DBD or DCD livers, from both centers.Conclusion:We suggest that a simple machine liver perfusion approach appears advantageous to protect from HCC recurrence after liver transplantation, despite extended tumor criteria.
