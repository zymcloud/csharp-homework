Objectives:To investigate whether quantitative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) analysis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can differentiate hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic epithelial angiomyolipoma (EAML) from nonepithelial AML.Methods:Retrospective analysis of 26 CEUS lesions pathologically confirmed as AML and 60 patients with confirmed HCC. Clinical and ultrasound (US) features of AML versus HCC and EAML versus nonepithelial AML were analyzed. Quantitative parameters, including arrival time, ascending slope, time to peak, peak intensity (PI), fall time (FT), and mean transit time (MTT), were analyzed. Diagnostic performance of MRI and CEUS was compared.Results:Angiomyolipoma was significantly different from HCC in US findings of solitary tumor (P .05). Epithelial AML was more likely to be hypoechoic with a centripetal filling pattern than nonepithelial AML (P Conclusions:Quantitative CEUS findings could be valuable in differentiating EAML from HCC.
