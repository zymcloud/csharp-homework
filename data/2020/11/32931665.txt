Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most common cancers worldwide and tends to be detected at an advanced stage. More effective biomarkers for HCC screening and prognosis assessment are needed and the mechanisms of HCC require further exploration. The role of MAOA in HCC has not been intensively investigated.Methods:In-house tissue microarrays, genechips, and RNAsequencing datasets were integrated to explore the expression status and the clinical value of MAOA in HCC. Immunohistochemical staining was utilized to determine MAOA protein expression. Intersection genes of MAOA related co-expressed genes and differentially expressed genes were obtained to perform functional enrichment analyses. In vivo experiment was conducted to study the impact of traditional Chinese medicine nitidine chloride (NC) on MAOA in HCC.Results:MAOA was downregulated and possessed an excellent discriminatory capability in HCC patients. Decreased MAOA correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Downregulated MAOA protein was relevant to an advanced TNM stage in HCC patients. Co-expressed genes that positively related to MAOA were clustered in chemical carcinogenesis, where CYP2E1 was identified as the hub gene. In vivo experiment showed that nitidine chloride significantly upregulated MAOA in a nude mouse HCC model.Conclusions:A decreased MAOA level is not only correlated with aggressive behaviors in males but also serves as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC patients. Moreover, MAOA may play a role in AFB1 toxic transformation through its synergistic action with co-expressed genes, especially CYP3A4. MAOA also serves as a potential therapy target of NC in HCC patients.
