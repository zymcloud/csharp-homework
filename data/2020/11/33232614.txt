Objective:To assess gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) value in classification (benign vs. malignant) and characterization of solid focal liver lesions (SFLLs) and impact on confidence in diagnosis.Methods:A total of 195 lesions (46 hepatocellular carcinomas [HCCs], 45 metastases, 32 adenomas, 37 focal nodular hyperplasias [FNHs] and 35 hemangiomas) were retrospectively evaluated in 93 patients. Three imaging datasets were compared: DWI/ apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (set A), Gd-EOB-DTPA (set B) and combination of both (set C). Two radiologists (R) independently classified (on a five-point ordinal scale) and characterized each lesion. The accuracy in classification and characterization was compared, and the diagnostic confidence was assessed.Results:The classification accuracy on set A, B and C was 86.2%, 91.3% and 91.8% (R1), and 84.6%, 91.8% and 93.3% (R2); and characterization accuracy was 67.2%, 88.2% and 87.7% (R1), and 60.5%, 88.2% and 85.6% (R2). Classification by reader 1 showed no significant difference between set A and B (p=.09). For both readers, there was a significant difference between set A and C in both classification and characterization (all p < .05), but no significant difference between set B and C in neither classification nor characterization. No significant difference between the three datasets in classification and characterization of hemangiomas (all p > .05). The diagnostic confidence of the readers has increased progressively from set A to Set C (all p < .01).Conclusions:DWI may suggest benignity or malignancy of solid liver lesions, while Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced imaging remains superior in lesions characterization and the combination of both increases the diagnostic confidence. DWI is very helpful in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas.
