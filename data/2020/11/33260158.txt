Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy with high rates of metastasis and relapse. Isoquercitrin (ISO), a natural flavonoid present in the Chinese bayberry and other plant species, reportedly exerts notable inhibitory effects on tumor cell proliferation, though the mechanism is unknown. In the present study, we exposed HepG2 and Huh7 human liver cancer cells to ISO and examined the roles of autophagy and apoptosis in ISO-mediated cell death. We found that ISO exposure inhibited cell viability and colony growth, activated apoptotic pathway, and triggered dysregulated autophagy by activating the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. Autophagy inhibition using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or Atg5-targeted siRNA decreased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage and protected cells against ISO-induced apoptosis. Moreover, autophagy inhibition reversed the upregulation of AMPK phosphorylation and downregulation of mTOR and p70S6K phosphorylation elicited by ISO. By contrast, application of a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor failed to inhibit autophagy in ISO-treated cells. These data indicate that ISO simultaneously induced apoptosis and autophagy, and abnormal induction of autophagic flux contributed to ISO-triggered caspase-3-dependent apoptosis.
