Accumulating data indicate caspase-1 (CASP1), one of the inflammatory caspases, promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression in tumor proliferation, invasion, EMT phenotype and sorafenib resistance. However, the molecular basis of regulating caspase-1 expression and caspase-1/IL1B (interleukin-1Î²) pathway in HCC remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated the novel interplay between caspase-1/IL1B activation and cluster differentiation 44 standard isoform (CD44s) in HCC. In this study, we observed that CD44s is responsible for caspase-1/IL1B activation both in HCC tissues and five HCC cell lines. In normoxia conditions, CD44s knockdown repressed the activation of caspase-1/IL1B via stimulating AMPK-mediated autophagy. Moreover, our data suggested that p62-induced autophagic degradation of caspase-1 accounted for caspase-1/IL1B inactivation in CD44s deficient cells. Administration of recombinant human IL1B could rescue impaired proliferation, invasion, and EMT phenotype in CD44s deficient HCC cells. Lastly, hypoxia-mediated caspase-1/IL1B overexpression could be abolished by CD44s downregulation through decreasing HIF1A and enhancing autophagic activity. Overall, targeting CD44s is a novel inhibitory mechanism of caspase-1/IL1B expression, both in normoxia and hypoxia conditions.
