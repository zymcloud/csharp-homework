Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of leading causes of chronic liver disease in the United States(1). NASH can lead to cirrhosis, end stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma and has become one of the leading indications for liver transplant in the United States(2). Reversal of NASH and improvement of NASH-related fibrosis is a major unmet need in the field of liver disease. Several therapies have shown promise in the treatment of NASH-related fibrosis but there are no food and drug administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved therapies.
