Background:Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a relatively rare malignant biliary system tumor, and yet it represents the second most common primary hepatic neoplasm, following hepatocellular carcinoma. Regardless of the type, location, or etiology, the survival prognosis of these tumors remains poor. The only method of cure for CCA is complete surgical resection, but part of patients with complete resection are still subject to local recurrence or distant metastasis.Summary:Over the last several decades, our understanding of the molecular biology of CCA has increased tremendously, diagnostic and evaluative techniques have evolved, and novel therapeutic approaches have been established. Key Messages: This review provides an overview of preoperative imaging evaluations of CCA. Furthermore, relevant information about artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging is discussed, as well as the development of AI in CCA treatment.
