Background:It is uncertain whether the prognosis of Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has improved.Aims:To evaluate whether the outcomes of BCLC stage 0 patients has improved, and if so, what are the reasons behind the noted improved outcome.Methods:A total of 591 patients with BCLC stage 0 HCC diagnosed at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea were grouped based on year of diagnosis (earlier cohort; 2007-2009 and later cohort; 2013-2015) and compared.Results:The overall survival (OS) was improved for BCLC stage 0 patients at later cohort (5-year survival rate: 82.1% vs. 92.0% for earlier cohort and later cohort, p = 0.015). However, after adjustment, the treatment period was not an independent factor for OS, especially when the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade was adjusted. The incidence of liver cirrhosis (LC)-related death was increased from 10.4% to 33.3%, while the incidence of HCC-related death decreased from 57.5% to 28.6% in the latter cohort.Conclusions:The survival improvement of BCLC stage 0 patients was largely explained by better liver function at diagnosis. Mortality from LC-related death was increasing, which calls for careful attention for finding strategies for preserving the liver function for BCLC stage 0 patients.
