Background and aim:As the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing globally, patients with both NAFLD and chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is also frequently found. This study aimed to investigate the clinical impact of concurrent NAFLD on the prognosis of patients with CHB-related HCC.Methods:Patients with CHB-related HCC who underwent surgical resection were consecutively selected from August 2009 to December 2013. The association between histologically proven concurrent NAFLD and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Propensity score (PS) matching was adapted to adjust for baseline characteristics. We also investigated the presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) among patients with NAFLD and its association with clinical outcomes.Results:Among 338 CHB-related HCC patients selected, 196 patients (58.0%) were diagnosed with concurrent NAFLD. The median follow-up duration was 74.9 months. The patients with NAFLD tended to have better recurrence-free survival (RFS; log-rank, P = 0.16) and had significantly better overall survival (OS; log-rank, P = 0.004) than those without NAFLD. However, the survival benefit of the concurrent NAFLD was not significant in a multivariable Cox analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.73, P = 0.84) or an analysis after PS matching (log-rank, P = 0.57). Regarding the presence or absence of NASH, no differences in the RFS (log-rank, P = 0.61) and OS (log-rank, P = 0.26) were found.Conclusions:Concurrent NAFLD was not associated with both RFS and OS in patients with CHB-related HCC after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Moreover, NAFLD patients with NASH did not have significantly different clinical outcomes compared with NAFLD patients without NASH.
