Purpose:We aimed to evaluate ultrasound-guided distal radial artery (DRA) access to perform abdominopelvic endovascular procedures.Methods:A prospective, observational study was carried out in a single center between December 2017 and February 2019. Forty-two abdominopelvic endovascular procedures were performed by the same operator in 37 patients with DRA access using a 5 F sheath. Most patients were male (67.6%) with a mean age of 62.0Â±11.4 years (age range, 27.6-82.8 years). Patient characteristics, including Barbeau's test classification, radial and ulnar sizes and technical success, were evaluated. Patients with a DRA smaller than 1.7 mm could not be safely punctured and were not included.Results:Procedures included chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma in 35 cases (83.3%), embolization of hepatic metastasis in neuroendocrine tumors in 4 cases (9.5%) and other embolization procedures in 3 cases (7.1%). The mean diameters of the DRA, proximal radial artery and proximal ulnar artery were 2.31, 2.63, and 2.09 mm, respectively. Out of 42 DRA puncture attempts, 97.6% (41/42) were successfully performed. There were no postoperative complications related to the access site, such as pain, palsy, paresthesia, occlusion, finger ischemia, bleeding, hematoma, and pseudoaneurysm. Transient forearm discomfort was reported in 7.1% of patients (3/42); one occurrence was associated with kinking rectification, and two occurrences were attributed to small arteries and/or vasospasm.Conclusion:Ultrasound-guided DRA access seems to be feasible and safe to perform in abdominopelvic endovascular procedures in patients with a DRA considered amenable to be safely punctured, with high technical success rates.
