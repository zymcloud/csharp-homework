Small cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract is very rare. Their aggressiveness and their poor prognosis make it grave. We report the management of a patient who consulted in the emergency room for low back pain and to whom the radiological and endoscopic assessments found a tumor of the upper urinary tract with lung, liver, bone and adrenal damage. Anatomopathological study of biopsies obtained by flexible ureteroscopy and percutaneous liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis and the metastatic nature of secondary lesions.
