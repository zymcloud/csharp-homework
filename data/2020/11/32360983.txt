Background & aims:Aspirin therapy has been associated with reduced risk of colon cancer, but there is only limited evidence for its effects on risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to investigate the association of daily aspirin therapy with HCV-related HCC risk.Methods:In this cohort study, based on Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we screened 237,963 patients with chronic HCV infection for the period of 1997 through 2011. We excluded patients with confounding conditions and 2478 patients who continuously received daily aspirin therapy for 90 days or more (treated group) were randomly matched 1:2 with 4956 patients who had never received antiplatelet therapy (untreated group) by means of propensity scores. Cumulative incidence of, and hazard ratio (HR) for, HCC development were analyzed after we adjusted for patient mortality as a competing risk event.Results:The cumulative incidence of HCC in the treated group was significantly lower than that in the untreated group over 5 years (4.67%; 95% CI, 3.74%-5.59% vs 7.32%; 95% CI, 6.33%-8.30%; PConclusions:In a nationwide cohort study in Taiwan, we found aspirin therapy to be significantly associated with a reduced risk of HCV-related HCC.
