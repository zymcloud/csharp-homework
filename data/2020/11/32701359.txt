The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RUSC1-AS1 has been reported to be dysregulated in the progression of many cancers. Also, RUSC1-AS1 had been detected to be highly expressed in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer cells, suggesting that RUSC1-AS1 may be a biomarker for cancers. However, the biological role and regulatory mechanism of RUSC1-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. In this study, we found that RUSC1-AS1 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells, and predicted unfavorable prognosis of HCC patients. The function assays including colony formation, EdU, TUNEL assay revealed that RUSC1-AS1 facilitated HCC cell proliferation and inhibited HCC cell apoptosis. Furthermore, mechanism assays including luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay demonstrated that RUSC1-AS1 could directly bind to hsa-miR-7-5p. Besides, hsa-miR-7-5p targeted and negatively regulated NOTCH3 expression. Moreover, RUSC1-AS1 sponged hsa-miR-7-5p to upregulate NOTCH3 and to trigger the NOTCH signaling pathway. The rescue assays depicted that RUSC1-AS1 regulated HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis through modulating NOTCH signaling. In conclusion, lncRNA RUSC1-AS1 promoted the proliferation and reduced the apoptosis of HCC cells through activation of NOTCH signaling via hsa-miR-7-5p/NOTCH3 axis.
