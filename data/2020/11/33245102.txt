Chemotherapy resistance is still a key hurdle in current hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. Therefore, clarifying the molecular mechanisms contributing to this acquired resistance is urgent for the effective treatment of liver cancer. In this research, we observed that lncRNA FAM225A expression is dramatically upregulated not only in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and cell lines but also in sorafenib-resistant HepG2/SOR cells. Moreover, FAM225A knockdown significantly weakened HepG2/SOR cells resistance to sorafenib treatment by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Similar results were obtained from the tumor xenograft model in mice. Further mechanistic researches revealed that the direct interaction between FAM225A and miR-130a-5p, while miR-130a-5p negatively modulated CCNG1 expression by targeting 3'UTR of CCNG1. MiR-130a-5p inhibition or CCNG1 overexpression could partially offset FAM225A knockdown-induced increased viability of HepG2/SOR cells in response to sorafenib challenge. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that FAM225A/miR-130a-5p/CCNG1 interaction network regulates the resistance of HCC cells to sorafenib treatment and could supply a possible strategy for restoring sorafenib sensitivity in HCC therapy.
