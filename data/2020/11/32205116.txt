Background and aims:Immune response against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have reported that interleukin 22 (IL-22) exhibits both protective and pathological properties in liver diseases. Our aim was to explore the importance of IL-22 in the development of HCC, and to characterize the relationship between IL-22 levels and the prognosis of HCC.Methods:Totally, 136 liver biopsy specimens from 46 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 37 with atypical hyperplasia (AH), 53 with HCC, patient-matched tumors and peritumoral surgical specimens from 56 HCC patients included in the study. The expression of IL-22 and CD8 was evaluated by immunochemistry. Corresponding serum samples were collected from 30 CHB, 30 AH, and 30 HCC patients. IL-22 expression was determined by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.Results:Liver-infiltrating IL-22+ cells increased in a stepwise manner from CHB to AH and HCC (CHB vs. AH, P=0.002; AH vs. HCC, P=0.010), whereas a decreasing trend was observed for CD8+ T cells (CHB vs. AH, P=0.031; AH vs. HCC, P=0.652). Serum IL-22 levels also increased from CHB to AH and HCC (CHB vs. AH, P=0.024; AH vs. HCC, P=0.026). Tumor-infiltrating IL-22+ cells and serum IL-22 were associated with histologic grade (P=0.024 and P=0.033). Additionally, CD8+ T cells correlated with tumor size (P=0.032). Furthermore, the high intratumoral IL-22+ cell group and high serum IL-22 group showed lower overall survival (OS; P=0.001, P=0.017) and disease-free survival (DFS; P=0.005, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that intratumoral IL-22+ cells and serum IL-22 levels were independent prognostic factors for both OS and DFS.Conclusions:These findings indicate that IL-22 promotes the progression of HCC in CHB patients. High tumor-infiltrating IL-22+ cells and serum IL-22 levels are thought to be unfavorable prognostic indicators for HCC.
