Plants polysaccharides are an infinite stock of drug composites with varying pharmacological and biological activities. The present investigation aimed to examine the antibacterial, anti-scavenging and cytotoxic potential of garden cress (GC) polysaccharides. The antibacterial effects vs Escherichia coli and as well as Staphylococcus aureus of GC polysaccharides were examined by means of agar diffusion assay, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), outer and inner cell membrane permeability. Antioxidant potential of the GC polysaccharides were performed by free radical DPPH scavenging, superoxide anion scavenging, hydroxyl radical scavenging, reducing power potential assay, and hydrogen peroxide method. Cytotoxicity potential of GC polysaccharides were evaluated by MTT assay in human cervical (HeLa) and liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. The findings showed that GC polysaccharides MIC were 1.06 and 0.56 mg mL-1 against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Compared to the standard inhibitor, the GC polysaccharides showed essential inhibitor assays in a very dose dependent approach, and notable actions to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also due to the large quantities of hydrophilic polyphenols. The IC50 values of all tested parameters were measured against standard ascorbic acid antioxidant agent. The GC polysaccharides diminish the cell viability percentage of HeLa and HepG2 in a concentration dependent manner. GC polysaccharides at a dose of 500 µg ml-1 exhibited higher anti-tumor activity in both HeLa (65.33 ± 3.75%) and HepG2 (60.33 ± 3.48%). The findings obtained in this study indicate that GC polysaccharides has antibacterial and has a possible source of natural antioxidant and also has cytotoxic effect on different carcinoma cell lines.
