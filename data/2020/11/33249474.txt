Background:Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and fatty liver (FL) are common, natural history data on concurrent FL and CHB (FL-CHB) are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of FL on cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and HBsAg seroclearance incidence in CHB patients.Methods:In a retrospective cohort study of 6,786 adult CHB patients, we used propensity score matching (PSM) to balance the FL-CHB and non-FL CHB groups. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare cumulative cirrhosis, HCC, and HBsAg seroclearance rates between subgroups.Results:Before PSM, compared to non-FL CHB, FL-CHB patients had lower 10-year cumulative rates of cirrhosis, HCC, and a higher HBsAg seroclearance rate. Similar results were found in the matched FL-CHB and non-FL CHB patients, as well as in antiviral treated PSM cohort. Cox proportional hazards model indicated FL to remain significantly and strongly associated with lower risk of cirrhosis and HCC (HR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.12-0.33, PConclusions:FL was significantly associated with lower cirrhosis and HCC risk and higher HBsAg seroclearance. Further studies are needed to confirm our funding and investigate the mechanisms underlying the impact of FL on CHB.
