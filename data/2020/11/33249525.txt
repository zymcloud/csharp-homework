Background:The impact of tumor necrosis relative to prognosis among patients undergoing curative-intent resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains ill-defined.Methods:Patients who underwent curative-intent resection for HCC without any prior treatment between 2000 and 2017 were identified from an international multi-institutional database. Tumor necrosis was graded as absent, moderate (Results:Among 919 patients who underwent curative-intent resection for HCC, the median tumor size was 5.0 cm (IQR, 3.0-8.5). Tumor necrosis was present in 367 (39.9%) patients (no necrosis: n = 552, 60.1% vs Conclusion:Tumor necrosis was associated with worse OS and RFS, as well as T-category upstaging of patients. A modified AJCC T classification that incorporates tumor necrosis should be considered in prognostic stratification of HCC patients.
