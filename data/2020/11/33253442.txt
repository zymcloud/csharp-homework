This study analyzed the impact of venous outflow congestion in the liver graft on hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence in liver transplantation recipients. Hepatocellular carcinoma patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation at Samsung Medical Center between 2007 and 2018 were included. The congested volume was calculated based on 2-week post-transplantation computed tomography. Recurrence-free survival and overall survival were analyzed using the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model including the degree of venous congestion. A total of 582 patients were included. There were 232 patients (39.9%) with certain degree of congestion volume. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed 1-, 5-, and 10-year recurrence-free survivals of 86.0%, 72.2%, and 70.7%, respectively, and overall survivals of 91.5%, 73.4%, and 68.9%, respectively. While congestion volume per 10 cm3 was a significant risk factor for recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.024, CI: 1.002-1.047, P = 0.034), there was no significant relationship with overall survival. (HR = 1.015, CI: 0.992-1.039, P = 0.213). Venous outflow congestion in the liver after living donor liver transplantation was related to the poor recurrence-free survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
