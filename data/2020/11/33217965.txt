By pegylated interferon (PegIFN)-free direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a sustained virological response (SVR) rate >95% can be attained with a satisfactory tolerability and shorter treatment duration. However, it remains controversial whether there is any difference in prognosis depending on regimens-PegIFN or DAAs. We compared the probabilities of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development between patients achieving an SVR by PegIFN/ribavirin (PegIFN group, n = 603) and DAAs (DAAs group, n = 479). The DAAs group was significantly older and had a higher proportion of cirrhosis than the PegIFN group. Before adjustment, the DAAs group had a higher HCC incidence than the PegIFN group (p < 0.001). However, by multivariate analyses, the DAAs (vs. PegIFN) group was not associated with HCC risk (adjusted hazard ratio 0.968, 95% confidence interval 0.380-2.468; p = 0.946). Old age, male, higher body mass index, cirrhosis, and lower platelet count were associated with increased HCC risk (all p < 0.05). After propensity score matching (PSM), a similar HCC risk between the two groups was observed (p = 0.372). We also compared HCC incidences according to sofosbuvir (SOF)-based and SOF-free DAAs, showing a similar risk in both groups before adjustment (p = 0.478) and after PSM (p = 0.855). In conclusion, post-SVR HCC risks were comparable according to treatment regimens; PegIFN- vs. DAA-based regimens and SOF-based vs. SOF-free DAA regimens. Further studies with a longer follow-up period are required.
