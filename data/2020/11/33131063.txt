Background & aims:Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance is considered a realistic goal in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), known as "functional cure". However, it remains elusive whether nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC)-induced HBsAg seroclearance, compared with spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance, differs in its association with favorable long-term clinical outcomes.Approach & results:A total of 1,972 CHB patients with confirmed HBsAg seroclearance at least two consecutive times, 6 months apart, were retrospectively analyzed. The risks of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and composite clinical events, including HCC, liver-related death, and liver transplantation, were compared between spontaneous and NUC-induced HBsAg seroclearance. Of 1,972 patients, the mean patient age was 53.7 years, and 64.4% were men. Cirrhosis was present in 297 (15.1%) patients. HBsAg seroclearance was achieved spontaneously in 1,624 (82.4%) patients and by NUC-treatment in 348 (17.6%) patients. HCC developed in 49 patients, with an annual incidence of 0.38/100 PY during a median follow-up of 5.6 years. With 336 propensity score-matched pairs, the risk of HCC (P=0.52) and clinical events (P=0.14) was not significantly differ between NUC-induced and spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance. By multivariable analysis, NUC-induced HBsAg seroclearance, compared with spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance, was not associated with the significantly higher risk of HCC (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.49; P=0.26) and clinical events (AHR, 1.78; P=0.06).Conclusions:Risks of HCC and clinical events were not significantly different between spontaneous and NUC-induced HBsAg seroclearance. Nonetheless, the annual risk of HCC exceeds the recommended cut-off for HCC surveillance even after HBsAg seroclearance, suggesting that continued HCC surveillance is required.
