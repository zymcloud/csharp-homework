Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the few cancers that can be diagnosed based on imaging findings alone. The factors associated with the decision to perform a biopsy and the clinical impact have not been previously studied.Methods:We collected data of patients diagnosed with HCC between 2004 and 2015 from the National Cancer Database. We assessed associations between biopsy and survival with demographic and clinical factors.Results:We included 160,507 patients. The median age was 62 (40-90), 74.1% were male and 74.9% were white. Over the 12-year period, 47.7% (76,524/160,517) underwent a biopsy. Factors associated with a biopsy were black race, older age, presence of metastatic disease, larger tumor size, and treatment at a community cancer center. Factors associated with increased mortality were older age, higher comorbidity index, larger tumor size, presence of metastatic disease, higher AFP and elevated bilirubin. There was a significant decreased use of biopsy over successive years (2007-2015). After adjusting for prognostic factors, biopsy had no significant impact on survival HR 1.01 (95%CI 1.00-1.03. p = 0.07).Conclusions:A significant number of patients underwent a biopsy. Performing a biopsy did not have a significant impact on survival.
