Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) are rare benign tumors of the liver, occurring predominantly in females using oral contraceptives. Our case describes a 66-year-old woman presenting with a palpable mass in her upper abdomen. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a large exophytic mass protruding from the caudal border of liver segments IV and V, without visible metastases. Laparoscopic resection of the tumor and gallbladder was performed. Histopathological examination showed a hepatocellular carcinoma with areas of HNF1a-HCA (H-HCA). This case shows that malignant transformation is possible in H-HCA. We present our preoperative decision-making process, as well as the role of imaging techniques in this rare case.
