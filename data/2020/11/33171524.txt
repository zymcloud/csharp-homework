Background and aim:This study aimed to elucidate the clinical importance of muscle volume loss (pre-sarcopenia) in patients receiving lenvatinib as treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC).Methods:Of 437 u-HCC patients treated with lenvatinib at specific institutions in Japan between March 2018 and May 2020, 151 with available computed tomography imaging data from the time of lenvatinib introduction were enrolled. Pre-sarcopenia was diagnosed based on a previously reported cut-off value calculation formula [psoas muscle area at level of middle of third lumbar vertebra (cm2 )/height (m)2 ]. Clinical features and prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) with inverse probability weighting were investigated retrospectively for their relationship with pre-sarcopenia.Results:Cox hazard multivariate analysis showed alpha-fetoprotein (â‰¥400 ng/mL) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.271, P Conclusion:Pre-sarcopenia was shown to be a significant prognostic factor in patients treated with lenvatinib for u-HCC.
