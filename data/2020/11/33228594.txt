Background:Research focusing on the relationship between five types of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) SNPs and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were still controversial. Hereby, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the association between TNF-α promoter SNPs: -1031 T/C, - 863 C/A, - 857 C/T, - 308 G/A, and - 238 G/A with HCC risk.Methods:We interrogated articles from journal database: PubMed, Pro-Quest, EBSCO, Science Direct, and Springer to determine the relationship between five types of SNPs in TNF-α gene with HCC risk. RevMan 5.3 software was used for analysis in fixed/random effect models.Results:This meta-analysis included 23 potential articles from 2004 to 2018 with 3237 HCC cases and 4843 controls. We found that SNP - 863 C/A were associated with a significantly increased HCC risk (A vs C, OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.03-1.67). Similar results were obtained in - 857 C/T (TT/CT vs CC, OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.06-1.62), - 308 G/A (AA vs GG, OR = 3.14, 95% CI = 2.06-4.79), and - 238 G/A (AA vs GG, OR = 3.87, 95% CI = 1.32-11.34). While no associations were observed between SNP TNF-α - 1031 T/C and HCC risk.Conclusions:The present meta-analysis showed that TNFα SNPs -863C/A, - 857 C/T, - 308 G/A, and - 238 G/A were associated with the risk of HCC.
