In the study, a new Schiff base (ligand) was obtained using 4-aminopyrimidine-2(1H)-one, the starting material, and 2,3,4-trimethoxy benzaldehyde. Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes were obtained from the reaction of the ligand and NiCl2Â·6H2O, PdCl2(CH3CN)2 (1:1 ratio). These compounds were characterized using the elemental and mass analysis, 1H, 13C-NMR, FT-IR, UV-Vis, magnetic susceptibility, thermal analysis, and the X-ray diffraction analyses. The antiproliferative activities of the synthesized ligand, Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes were identified on the HepG2 (human liver cancer cells) cell line and their biocompatibility was tested on the L-929 (fibroblast cells) cell line by the MTT analysis method. Furthermore, the effects of electroporation (EP) on the cytotoxic activities of synthesized compounds were investigated in HepG2 cancer cells. According to the MTT findings of the study, the ligand did not exhibit an antiproliferative activity while its Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes exhibited an antiproliferative activity. Moreover, it was observed that the antiproliferative activity of the Pd(II) complex was stronger than that of the Ni(II) complex. The combined application of EP + compounds is much more effective than the usage of the compounds alone in the treatment of HepG2 cancer cells. The EP increased the cytotoxicity of the Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes by 1.66, and 2.54 times, respectively. It was concluded that Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes may contribute as potential anti-cancer agents for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and yield promising results in the case of being used in ECT.
