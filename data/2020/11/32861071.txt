Chitinase 3-like protein 1(CHI3L1) participates in physiological and pathophysiological process, such as cell survival, cell proliferation, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, etc. Some studies demonstrated that CHI3L1 is liver-enriched and has better application value in staging liver fibrosis than platelet ratio index(APRI) and Ô¨Åbrosis-4 index(FIB-4) and that CHI3L1 can be used in monitoring the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this review, we summarized the pathophysiological role and the diagnostic value of CHI3L1 in liver fibrosis in different background and HCC.
