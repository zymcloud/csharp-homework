Background:miRNA-105 has been reported in a vast number of malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal, esophageal, breast and non-small lung cancers. Still, the biological role of miR-105 remains mostly uncovered in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).Methods:miR-105 expression in OSCC tissues and cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, while the prognostic significance of miR-105 was evaluated by Cox regression analysis with a cohort of 90 OSCC patients. The effects of miR-105 on the proliferation of tumor cells were analyzed by CCK-8 assay and crystal violet staining, while cell invasion was assessed by transwell assays.Results:Our current work indicates that miR-105 was upregulated in human OSCC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, miR-105 expression was closely associated with tumor size as well as clinical and differentiation stages. Notably, an elevated expression of miR-105 may predict some poor clinical prognosis in OSCC patients. Furthermore, miR-105 overexpression can significantly promote the proliferation and invasion of OSCC cells, whereas downregulation of miR-105 inhibits these cellular events.Conclusion:This study demonstrates that miR-105 can promote the proliferation and invasion of OSCC cells. High expression of miR-105 predicts poor prognosis for OSCC and, therefore, it may represent a prognostic biomarker and putative therapeutic target for patients affected by OSCC.
