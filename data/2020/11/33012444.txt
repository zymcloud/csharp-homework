Hepatocellular carcinoma is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Owing to the current epidemic of metabolic syndrome, the population affected by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis continues to increase and now comprises a significant portion with those with hepatocellular carcinoma. The World Health Organization goal of obtaining universal hepatitis B virus vaccination has led to a global effort to improve vaccination, prevent mother-to-child transmission, and implement linkage to care to avoid the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast with the decreased burden of chronic hepatitis C virus, there has been an increase in new-onset acute hepatitis C virus.
