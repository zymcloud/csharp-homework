Purpose:The liver function index can predict the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and many other non-neoplastic diseases. We aimed to determine whether the preoperative albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade could predict the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer (GC).Patients and methods:Data of 243 patients with GC who underwent radical resection were collected retrospectively. Patients were divided into the high ALBI (>-2.34) and low ALBI (≤-2.34) grade groups. Overall survival was analyzed between the two groups using the Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the independent factors associated with postoperative complications and overall survival.Results:The postoperative complication rates were higher in the high ALBI grade group than in the low ALBI grade group (P=0.005). The high ALBI grade group also had worse overall survival (PConclusion:Preoperative ALBI grade could predict postoperative complications and overall survival of patients with GC, especially those with TNM stages II-III. This grading method has the advantages of preoperative availability, simplicity, and objectivity and aids in improving preoperative prognosis prediction and in achieving better outcomes of postoperative chemotherapy.
