Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of primary liver cancer and dietary exposure to aflatoxins is a major risk factor of HCC. The current study aimed to assess the role of resveratrol and nicotinamide in renal toxicity during alcohol-aflatoxin-B1-induced HCC. The results revealed that resveratrol treatment normalized the level of urea, lipid peroxidation, lactate and lactate dehydrogenase, which were increased in HCC. It also downregulated the increased expression of sirtuin 1 in HCC kidney. Furthermore, amelioration of oxidative stress in kidney of HCC rats by resveratrol was observed to be catalase dependent and glutathione peroxidase independent.
