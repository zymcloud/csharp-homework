Colorectal cancer is the second most lethal cancer type across all ages and sexes, the many mechanisms of which are still currently being further elucidated. PIERCE1 has been known to be involved in the cell cycle and proliferation, the expression of which is regulated by stress conditions in a p53-dependent manner. Through a database search, we found that PIERCE1 was significantly augmented in patients with colorectal carcinoma compared to normal samples, suggesting its possible role in tumor regulation. Recently, PIERCE1 has also been reported to increase proliferation of a liver cancer cell line, indicating its possible role as an oncogene. To examine its relevance to tumorigenesis, such as whether it has either oncogenic or tumor suppressive function, PIERCE1 was knocked down and overexpressed in several colorectal cancer cell lines and mice, respectively. To evaluate the roles of Pierce1 in vivo, we established a Pierce1 transgenic (TG) mouse model and then administered azoxymethane with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colorectal carcinogenesis via promoting mutations in Apc and Kras. Nonetheless, PIERCE1 depletion in these cell lines showed no significant change in cell growth. AOM/DSS-treated Pierce1 TG mice were comparable with respect to colon lengths, the number of polyps, and tumor sizes to those of the control mice. These results implicate that PIERCE1 does not play an oncogenic or tumor suppressive role in AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer.
