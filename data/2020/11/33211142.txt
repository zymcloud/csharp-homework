Objectives:To evaluate the postoperative prognostic value of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) category on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT in patients with primary liver carcinomas (PLCs).Methods:A total of 189 patients with chronic liver disease and surgically proven single PLC (42 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and 21 combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas and 126 hepatocellular carcinomas [2:1 matching to non-HCC malignancies]) were retrospectively evaluated with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and PET-CT. Two independent reviewers assigned an LI-RADS category for each observation. The tumor-to-liver standardized uptake value ratio (TLR) was calculated. The overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and the associated factors were evaluated.Results:In multivariable analysis, LI-RADS category (LR-4 or LR-5 [LR-4/5] vs. LR-M; OS, hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p = 0.006; RFS, HR 1.61, p = 0.028) and TLR (low, 0.05).Conclusions:Both LI-RADS category on MRI and TLR on PET-CT are associated with the postoperative prognosis of PLCs. The prognosis of PLCs classified as LR-M can be further stratified according to the TLR group, but not for the PLCs classified as LR-4/5.Key points:• The LI-RADS category (LR-4/5 vs. LR-M) and tumor-to-liver standardized uptake value ratio (TLR, low vs. high) were independent factors for postoperative prognosis of primary liver carcinomas (PLCs). • For PLCs classified as LR-M, the TLR group helps stratify the postoperative prognosis of PLCs, with the high TLR group having a poor prognosis and the low TLR group having a better prognosis (p = 0.008 for OS and p 0.05).
