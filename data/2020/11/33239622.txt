Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high mortality rate and lacks an effective therapeutic target. Elevated expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is an important hallmark in cancers, but the mechanism by which TERT is activated differentially in cancers is poorly understood. Here, we have identified nuclear receptor coactivator-3 (NCOA3) as a new modulator of TERT expression and tumor growth in HCC. NACO3 specifically binds to the TERT promoter at the -234 to -144 region and transcriptionally activates TERT expression. NCOA3 promotes HCC cell growth and tumor progression in vitro and in vivo through upregulating the TERT signaling. Knockdown of NACO3 suppresses HCC cell viability and colony formation, whereas TERT overexpression rescues this suppression. NCOA3 interacts with and recruits SP1 binding on the TERT promoter. Knockdown of NCOA3 also inhibits the expression of the Wnt signaling-related genes but has no effect on the Notch signaling-targeting genes. Moreover, NCOA3 is positively correlated with TERT expression in HCC tumor tissues, and high expression of both NCOA3 and TERT predicts a poor prognosis in HCC patients. Our findings indicate that targeting the NCOA3-SP1-TERT signaling axis may benefit HCC patients.
