Aim:Niclosamide (NIC) is an anthelmintic agent repurposed as a potent anticancer agent. However, its use is hindered by its poor solubility. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of NIC anticancer activity employing a novel oral NIC pluronic-based nanoformulation and tested its effect in thioacetamide-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rats. We evaluated its antitumor effect through regulating Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling pathways and apoptosis.Main methods:Niclosamide-loaded pluronic nanoparticles (NIC-NPs) were optimally developed and characterized with sustained release properties up to 7 days. Sixteen weeks after HCC induction, NIC (70 mg/kg) and an equivalent dose of NIC-NPs were administered orally for 3 consecutive weeks. Hepatocyte integrity was assessed by measuring serum levels of aminotransferases, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin and total protein. HCC development was detected by measuring AFP expression. Necroinflammation and fibrosis were scored by histopathological examination. Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling were evaluated by measuring hepatic mRNA levels of Wnt3A, Lrp5 and Lrp6 Co-receptors, Dvl-2, Notch1 and Hes1 and β-catenin protein levels. Apoptosis was assessed by measuring mRNA and protein levels of cyclin D1 and caspase-3.Key finding:The novel NIC-NPs restored liver integrity, reduced AFP levels and showed improved anticancer and proapoptotic activities compared to drug alone. The inhibitory effect of NIC on Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling pathways was potentiated by the NIC-NPs formulation.Significance:We conclude that NIC acts by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling and inducing apoptosis in HCC. Developing pluronic-based nanoformulations may be a promising approach to improve NIC solubility and offer the possibility of controlled release.
