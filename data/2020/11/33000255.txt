Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global public health problem. Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are the main causes of death in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection. Liver fibrosis is an important cause of cirrhosis and end‑stage liver disease after CHC infection. Along with the course of infection, liver fibrosis exhibits a progressive exacerbation. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are involved in both physiological and pathological processes of the liver. During the chronic liver injury process, the activated HSCs transform into myofibroblasts, which are important cells in the development of liver fibrosis. At present, HCV infection still lacks specific markers for the accurate detection of the disease condition and progression. Therefore, the present review focused on HSCs, which are closely related to HCV‑infected liver fibrosis, and analyzed the changes in the HSCs, including their surface‑specific markers, cytokine production, activation, cell function and morphological structure. The present review aimed to propose novel diagnostic markers, at both the cellular and molecular level, which would be of great significance for the timely diagnosis of the disease. According to this aim, the characteristic changes of HSCs during HCV infection were reviewed in the present article.
