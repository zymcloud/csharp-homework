Background:Conflicting studies were proposed either suggested or denied the relationship between early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence and the use of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C management AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate HCC recurrence rate post-DAAs and potential predictive factors.Study This prospective cohort study included all HCC patients achieved complete response attending our multidisciplinary HCC clinic, Cairo University, from November 2013 to February 2018. Group I (60 patients) who received DAAs after HCC ablation and group II (273 patients) who were DAAs-untreated. We studied factors that could play a role in HCC recurrence.Results:The sustained virological response rate was 88.3% among DAA-treated patients. HCC recurrence rate was 45% in the post-DAA group vs. 19% in the non-DAAs group; P Conclusion:Our study reports high rate of HCC recurrence post-DAA therapy in patients treated with transarterial chemoembolization but not in those treated with curative measures. DAA therapy after curative treatment for HCC led to significantly earlier HCC recurrence, which correlated with specific clinic-pathologic features in our prospective single-institution study. However, future independent prospective randomized studies are warranted to evaluate this correlation which may lead to a change in the current standard-of-care approach to patients with hepatitis C virus-related HCC.
