Objective:Programmed death ligand-2 (PD-L2)has been detected in various cancers. However, its prognostic value in digestive system cancers (DSCs) remains unclear. Accordingly, this meta-analysis investigated the prognostic and clinicopathological utility of PD-L2 in patients with DSCs.Methods:We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov., Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases for eligible studies up to April 30, 2020. The hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of the outcomes were calculated.Results:Twenty two studies with 4886 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that PD-L2 overexpression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR 1.470, 95% CI: 1.252-1.728, p Conclusion:PD-L2 overexpression in DSCs after surgery might predict a poor prognosis, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer. Larger patient cohorts are needed to validate its prognostic role.
