Background:Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint have demonstrated substantial clinical benefit for a variety of solid tumors. However, their applications in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are reported with unclear molecular mechanisms. Here, we report a novel mouse anti-human PD-1 mAb that can reverse the immunosuppressive effect of HePG2 cells on Jurkat cells.Materials and methods:HepG2 liver cancer cells, which were induced to overexpress PD-L1 by IFN-Î³, were co-cultured with PHA-activated Jurkat lymphocytic cells to investigate the immunostimulative effect and mechanisms of the 14 newly generated PD-1 mAbs. Multiple cellular and molecular biology experiments were performed in this study, such as CCK-8, ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and Western blot.Results:We found that mAb B1C4 significantly enhanced the tumor-killing cytokine secretion level by Jurkat cells in the co-culture system and increased the killing ability of Jurkat cells on HepG2 cells. Co-culture with HePG2 cells led to Jurkat cell cycle delay in S phase, and B1C4 promoted cell cycle progression from S to G2/M. Co-culture with HePG2 cells also caused apoptosis in Jurkat cells, which was inhibited by B1C4. B1C4 reversed the immunosuppression of Jurkat cells resulted from co-cultured with HePG2 cells through inhibiting PTEN and activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.Conclusion:Our study demonstrated that anti-PD-1 mAb B1C4 could inhibit the apoptosis of Jurkat cells induced by HePG2 hepatoma cells and reverse the immunosuppressive effect of HePG2 cells on Jurkat cells. The study provides a vital basis for applying PD-1 monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of HCC and provides antibody selection for the development of novel PD-1 mAb with blocking activity.
