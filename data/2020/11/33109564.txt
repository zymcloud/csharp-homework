Background/aim:Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. This study aimed to investigate the anticancer effect of the combination treatment of Ribociclib (LEE011) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) on CRC cells.Materials and methods:HT-29 and SW480 cells were treated with LEE011, 5-FU, or the combination of LEE011 and 5-FU. Cell viability and cycle were investigated through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay and flow cytometry. The expression of cell cycle-related proteins was determined through western blot.Results:The combined treatment of LEE011 with 5-FU synergistically reduced cell viability in HT-29 and SW480 cells. Specifically, it induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, down-regulated the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and the expression of p53.Conclusion:LEE011 exhibited potential as an effective therapeutic inhibitor for the combination treatment of CRC patients.
