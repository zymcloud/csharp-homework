Background:Disturbances in fatty acid (FA) metabolism have been reported in cirrhosis, but the role of FAs in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. Biomarkers are a promising means to explore the associations between exogenous intake or endogenous production of FAs and cancer risk.Aim:To estimate the relationship between fatty acid content in erythrocyte membranes and HCC risk in cirrhotic patients METHODS: The "CiRCE" case-control study recruited cirrhotic patients from six French hospitals between 2008 and 2012. Cases were cirrhotic patients with HCC (n = 349); controls were cirrhotic patients without HCC at inclusion (n = 550). FA composition of phospholipids in erythrocyte membranes was determined by high performance gas chromatography. Odds ratios for HCC risk according to FA concentrations were estimated with multivariable logistic regression.Results:HCC patients were older and more often men (P Conclusions:The FA composition of erythrocyte membranes differed according to the presence of HCC with higher levels of saturated FAs, linoleic and eicosadienoic acids, and lower levels of stearic and arachidonic acids. These alterations may reflect particular dietary patterns and/or altered FA metabolism. Further investigations are warranted.
