Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, is considered as the only approved drug to cure the advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the acquired chemoresistance caused by intratumoral hypoxia through sorafenib long term therapy induces sorafenib inefficacy. We demonstrated here that hypoxia significantly attenuated sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib treatment and reduced its proliferation. Autophagy was observed in sorafenib-treated HCC cells in hypoxia, and inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA eliminated hypoxia-induced sorafenib resistance. Further study revealed hypoxia-activated FOXO3a, an important cellular stress transcriptional factor, via inducing its dephosphorylation and nuclear location; and FOXO3a-dependent transcriptive activation of beclin-1 was responsible for hypoxia-induced autophagy in HCC cells. Knockout of FOXO3a inhibited the autophagy induced by sorafenib itself in normoxia and significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of sorafenib in HCC cells; and it also inhibited the hypoxia-induced autophagy and achieved the same effect in sorafenib sensitivity-enhancement in HCC cells as it in normoxia. Finally, knockout of intratumoral FOXO3a significantly enhanced curative efficacy of sorafenib via inhibition of autophagy in xenograft tumors in nude mice. Collectively, our study suggests that FOXO3a plays a key role in regulating hypoxia-induced autophagy in sorafenib-treated HCC, and FOXO3-targeted therapy may serve as a promising approach to improve clinical prognosis of patients suffering from HCC.
