Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) exists as a spectrum of disease ranging from excessive accumulation of fat within the liver (simple steatosis), inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) through to fibrosis, cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. There is also an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The principal risk factor for NAFLD is overweight or obesity, along with type 2 diabetes, and NAFLD itself is also a risk factor for incident type 2 diabetes. Overweight/obesity is synergistic with alcohol consumption in causing progressive and insidious liver damage. Recent consensus advocates a change in nomenclature from NAFLD to 'metabolic associated fatty liver disease' (MAFLD), reflective of the associated metabolic abnormalities (insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome components). Additional extra-hepatic manifestations of NAFLD include cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and certain cancers. Unlike other micro- and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes, systematic screening or surveillance protocols have not been widely adopted in routine diabetes care to assess for presence/severity of NAFLD. Various screening tools are available (non-invasive tests and biochemical indices) combined with imaging techniques (e.g. transient elastography) to detect steatosis and more importantly advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis to facilitate appropriate surveillance. Liver biopsy may be sometimes necessary. Treatment options for type 2 diabetes, including lifestyle interventions (dietary change and physical activity), glucose-lowering therapies and metabolic surgery, can modulate hepatic steatosis and to a lesser extent fibrosis. Awareness of the impact of liver disease on the choice of glucose-lowering medications in individuals with type 2 diabetes is also critical.
