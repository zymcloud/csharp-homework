Measuring transverse relaxation rate (R2* = 1/T2*) via MRI allows for noninvasive evaluation of multiple clinical parameters, including liver iron concentration (LIC) and fat fraction. Both fat and iron contribute to diffuse liver disease when stored in excess in the liver. This liver damage leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis with an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver iron concentration is linearly related to R2* measurements using MRI. A phantom was constructed to assess R2* quantification variability on 1.5 and 3 T MRI systems. Quantification was executed using least-squares curve fitting techniques. The phantom was created using readily available, low-cost materials. It contains four vials with R2* values that cover a clinically relevant range (100 to 420 Hz at 1.5 T). Iron content was achieved using ferric chloride solutions contained in glass vials, each affixed in a three-dimensional (3D)-printed polylactide (PLA) structure, surrounded by distilled water, all housed in a sealed acrylic cylinder. Multiple phantom stands were also 3D-printed using PLA for precise orientation of the phantom with respect to the direction of the static magnetic field. Acquisitions at different phantom angles, across multiple MRI systems, and with different pulse sequence parameters were evaluated. The variability between any two R2* measurements, taken in the same vial under these various acquisition conditions, on a 1.5 T MRI system, was
HIC; LIC; MR relaxometry; R2* relaxometry; iron overload.
