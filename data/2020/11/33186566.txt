We investigated the association between c-Src and the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its underlying mechanisms. The relationship between c-Src expression and the occurrence and development of HCC was explored using GEPIA and further confirmed by western blotting analysis and real-time quantitative PCR. CCK-8, flow cytometry, Transwell, and wound-healing assays were conducted to analyze the effects of c-Src on the growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and infiltration of HCC cells. Mouse models of transplanted xenogeneic human tumors were constructed to explore the effects of c-Src on HCC tumor growth. Compared with that in adjacent normal liver tissues, the expression level of c-Src in HCC tissues was significantly increased and was negatively correlated with patient survival. These findings are consistent with those in the GEPIA database. Downregulation of c-Src expression can inhibit the growth, infiltration, and migration of HCC cells. c-Src impeded the translocation of YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and promoted Yes-associated protein transcriptional activity. In vivo experiments showed that c-Src inhibition suppressed tumor growth in mice. We found that c-Src can promote the growth and tumorigenesis of HCC cells by activating the Hippo signaling pathway.
