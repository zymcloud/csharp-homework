Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as the most common type of primary malignant liver cancer, has become a leading cause of cancer deaths in recent years. Accurate segmentation of HCC lesions is critical for tumor load assessment, surgery planning, and postoperative examination. As the appearance of HCC lesions varies greatly across patients, traditional manual segmentation is a very tedious and time-consuming process, the accuracy of which is also difficult to ensure. Therefore, a fully automated and reliable HCC segmentation system is in high demand. In this work, we present a novel hybrid neural network based on multi-task learning and ensemble learning techniques for accurate HCC segmentation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs). First, three task-specific branches are integrated to enlarge the feature space, based on which the network is able to learn more general features and thus reduce the risk of overfitting. Second, an ensemble learning scheme is leveraged to perform feature aggregation, in which selective kernel modules (SKMs) and spatial and channel-wise squeeze-and-excitation modules (scSEMs) are adopted for capturing the features from different spaces and scales. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets, with segmentation accuracies of 0.797, 0.923, and 0.765 in the PAIP, CRAG, and UHCMC&CWRU datasets, respectively, which demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing the HCC segmentation problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work on the pixel-wise HCC segmentation of H&E-stained WSIs.
