Injectable hydrogels with pH-sensitive and self-healing properties have great application potential in the field of anti-cancer drug carriers. In this work, an injectable hydrogel is prepared using 4armPEG-benzaldehyde (4armPEGDA) and N-carboxyethyl chitosan (CEC) as a new drug carrier. The gelation time, equilibrium swelling rate, degradation time, and dynamic modulus of the injectable hydrogels can be adjusted by merely changing the concentration of 4armPEGDA. The volume of the hydrogel shrinks at pH 5.6 and expands at pH 7.4, which helps to control the release of anti-cancer drug. At pH 5.6, the hydrogels show a fast and substantial Dox release effect, which is five times higher than that at pH 7.4. In vitro cumulative drug release of all the hydrogels reached equilibrium on about the fourth day, and the hydrogel is completely degraded within five days, which contributes to the Dox-loaded hydrogel to further release the remaining Dox. Moreover, the Dox-loaded hydrogel shows a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). Finally, the anti-tumor model experiment in vivo demonstrated that the Dox-loaded hydrogel can significantly inhibit tumor growth within five days. Therefore, such injectable hydrogels are excellent carriers for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
