Objective:We investigated the safety and effectiveness of a modified transabdominal approach for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a supradiaphragmatic inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus (TT).Methods:Eight patients underwent radical nephrectomy with removal of a supradiaphragmatic IVC-TT through an abdominal incision using a transdiaphragmatic approach in Peking University Third Hospital from April 2015 to January 2018. We modified this technique using a Foley catheter balloon to avoid piggyback liver mobilization.Results:All patients underwent successful operations. The median operative time was 7 hours 23 minutes. The median estimated blood loss was 2963 mL. All patients received a blood transfusion with a median blood infusion volume of 2162 mL. Two patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome developed postoperative ascites and hydrothorax due to non-watertight repair of the diaphragm. During a follow-up of 11 to 44 months, only one patient died of liver metastasis and four patients developed distant metastasis without recurrence in the IVC.Conclusions:The modified transabdominal approach described herein has an encouraging safety profile and provides a surgical option for treatment of RCC with a supradiaphragmatic IVC-TT. More evidence concerning the beneficial role of this procedure will be elucidated in further studies.
