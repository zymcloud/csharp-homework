Kasai operation is widely performed for biliary atresia (BA), as it improves the prognosis. Biliary tract cancer has rarely been reported as a complication after Kasai operation. A 17-year-old man underwent liver transplantation for progressive jaundice and liver dysfunction after Kasai operation for BA. A macroscopic examination of the explanted liver revealed a 3.6-cm-diameter mass in the hilus of the explanted liver. The tumor consisted of an atypical proliferation of glandular cells in the collagenous stroma. The differential diagnosis included a florid ductular reaction and primary adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the glandular cells were diffusely positive for IGF2BP3 and S100P, but negative for CDX2. A diagnosis of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma arising from the liver hilus was made. To our knowledge, this is the third case of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma after Kasai operation for BA. The previously reported cases had a poor prognosis, but the current case did not recur during a 15-year follow-up. Cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma can occur as a late complication of BA after Kasai operation, and early detection and liver transplantation may improve the prognosis.
