Sorafenib (SOR), a multi-kinase inhibitor for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), reveals a limited therapeutic effect due to a lack of selectivity and evident drug resistance. In the present study, bismuth-based mesoporous nanomaterial (NBOF) is loaded with SOR and then coated with polyethylene glycol and folic acid conjugates (P-FA) to form an NBOF@SOR-P-FA nanocarrier system. The system achieves significantly enhanced anti-cancer efficacy by combining chemotherapy with radiotherapy. To evaluate the effect of synergistic treatment, cytotoxicity detection, Live/Dead staining, apoptotic assay, and Western blot analysis are performed. The results suggest that NBOF@SOR-P-FA significantly inhibits HCC cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis. Also, the NBOF@SOR-P-FA exhibits excellent biocompatibility by hemolysis and serum biochemical tests and produces a substantially enhanced contrast efficiency as compared to iohexol by computed tomography imaging. More importantly, the profound suppression of tumor growth and potentiation of apoptosis are observed in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model. Collectively, these results indicate that the bismuth-based nanotheranostic platform could enhance the therapeutic effect of sorafenib and serve as an innovative method for HCC treatment.
