EZH2, a histone methyltransferase, has been shown to involve in cancer development and progression via epigenetic regulation of tumor suppressor microRNAs, whereas BMI1, a driver of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a downstream target of these microRNAs. However, it remains unclear whether EZH2 can epigenetically regulate microRNA expression to modulate BMI1-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, we established that high EZH2 expression correlated with enhanced tumor size, elevated metastasis, increased relapse, and poor prognosis in HCC patients. Further clinical studies revealed that EZH2 overexpression was positively correlated to its gene copy number gain/amplification in HCC. Mechanistically, EZH2 epigenetically suppressed miR-200c expression both in vitro and in vivo, and more importantly, miR-200c post-transcriptionally regulated BMI1 expression by binding to the 3'-UTR region of its mRNA. Furthermore, miR-200c overexpression inhibits the growth of HCC cells in vivo. Silencing miR-200c rescued the tumorigenicity of EZH2-depleted HCC cells, whereas knocking down BMI1 reduced the promoting effect of miR-200c depletion on HCC cell migration. Finally, combination treatment of EZH2 and BMI1 inhibitors further inhibited the viability of HCC cells compared with the cells treated with EZH2 or BMI1 inhibitor alone. Our findings demonstrated that alteration of EZH2 gene copy number status induced BMI1-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis via epigenetically silencing miR-200c, providing novel therapeutic targets for HCC treatment.
