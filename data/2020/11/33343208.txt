Locoregional therapies (lrts) play an important role in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), with the aim of increasing overall survival while preserving liver function. Various forms of lrt are available, and choosing the best one depends on technical aspects, liver morphology, tumour biology, and the patient's symptoms. The purpose of the present review article is to provide an overview of the current evidence relating to the use of percutaneous ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, and transarterial radioembolization for the curative or palliative treatment of hcc. Special situations are also reviewed, including the combined use of systemic therapy and lrt, indications and techniques for bridging to transplant and downstaging, and the use of lrt to treat patients with hcc and macrovascular invasion.
