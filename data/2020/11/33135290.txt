Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been demonstrated to play important roles in cancer progress. However, the roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unclear. Here, we found has_circRNA_001306 (circ_1306) was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown the expression circ_1306 significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation and induced the cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we identified circ_1306 could up-regulate the expression of CDK16 by sponging miR-584-5p. The expression of miR-584-5p was decreased, and the expression of CDK16 was increased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Meanwhile, either knockdown of miR-584-5p or overexpression of CDK16 could suppress the HCC cell proliferation. In vivo, overexpression of miR-584-5p or knockdown of circ_1306 could inhibit the expression of CDK16, and suppress tumour growth. Altogether, our findings suggested that circ_1306 could promoter HCC progress by miR-584-5p/CDK16 axis, which provided a novel marker for HCC diagnosis and treatment.
