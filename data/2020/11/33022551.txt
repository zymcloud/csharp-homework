Purpose:To investigate whether Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) imaging features at preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI can predict microvascular invasion (MVI) and histologic grade of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to evaluate their associations with recurrence after curative resection of single HCC.Materials and methods:From July 2015 to September 2018, 111 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed HCC who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI within 1 month before surgery were included in this retrospective study. Significant MRI findings and clinical parameters for predicting MVI, high-grade HCCs and postoperative recurrence were identified by logistic regression model and Cox proportional hazards model.Results:Twenty-six of 111 (23.4 %) patients had MVI and 36 of 111 (32.4 %) patients had high-grade HCCs, whereas 44 of 95 (46.3 %) patients experienced recurrence. Tumor size > 5 cm (OR = 9.852; p 400 ng/mL (HR = 2.071; p = 0.023) were independent predictors of recurrence.Conclusion:LI-RADS imaging features can be used as potential biomarkers for predicting aggressive pathologic features and recurrence of HCC. The identification of prognostic LI-RADS imaging features may facilitate the selection of surgical candidates and optimize the management of HCC patients.
