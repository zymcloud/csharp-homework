Objective:This study aimed at confirming the alteration of circulating anti-p16 immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:An in-house-developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for determining plasma IgG antibodies against p16-derived antigens in 122 HCC patients and 134 healthy controls.Results:Plasma anti-p16 IgG levels were significantly higher in HCC patients than in the controls (Z = 3.51, P = 0.0004), with no difference between males and females. A trend of increasing plasma anti-p16 IgG levels was associated with increasing HCC stage, with group 3 patients having the highest anti-p16 IgG levels (Z = 3.38, P = 0.0008). Group 3 exhibited the best sensitivity (19.6%) and specificity (95%) for plasma anti-p16 IgG detection, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.659 (95% confidence interval, 0.564-0.754).Conclusion:Circulating IgG antibody to p16 protein might be a useful biomarker for HCC prognosis assessment rather than for early malignancy diagnosis.
