Objectives:To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of liver-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium-containing contrast agent guidance for microwave ablation (MWA) of recurrent small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:The Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University approved this study. Eighteen patients presented with 30 recurrent small HCCs, at least one lesion per patient was undetectable on unenhanced MRI, but this was clearly demonstrated in the hepatobiliary phase after liver-specific MRI contrast agent administration. Gd-BOPTA (16 cases) or Gd-EOB-DTPA (2 cases) were injected half an hour before the procedure, and MWA was performed by percutaneous puncture of the target lesion with a magnetic resonance-compatible microwave antenna under 1.5 T MRI guidance.Results:The technical success rate was 100%. The mean maximum diameter of the lesions was 9.7 ± 2.8 mm (5.0-15.4 mm). The mean follow-up time was 11.6 ± 4.7 months (range, 4-19 months), and no local recurrence was observed.Conclusions:MWA of small HCCs guided by enhanced liver-specific MRI contrast agent is a safe and effective technique.
