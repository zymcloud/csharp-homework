Backgrounds/aims:Intrahepatic recurrence is frequent result after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We analyzed the clinical results of patients who had the intrahepatic recurrences of HCC after curative surgical resections.Methods:From January 2009 to December 2016, 320 patients underwent curative surgical resection for HCC in department of Surgery, Korea Cancer Center Hospital. After surgical resection, 155 patients had suffered HCC recurrence during follow-up period. Among them, 122 patients had only intrahepatic recurrence initially, who were included in this retrospective study. We analyzed about the period of the recurrence after surgery, treatment methods for the recurred tumors, and poor prognostic factors for survival after intrahepatic recurrences.Results:Among the 122 patients, 83 patients had recurrence within 24 months after surgery. Thirty-eight patients underwent curative treatment for the recurred tumors (re-resection in 18, radiofrequency ablation in 20 patients). Non-curative treatments were performed in 77 patients (TACE in 68 patients, radiotherapy in 9 patients) and conservative management in 7 patients. Five-year survival rate of patients who underwent curative treatment is 86.4% (p≤0.001). Five-year survival rate of non-curative treatment is 55.7% (p≤0.001), conservative management is 0% (p=0.021). Among the clinical factors, non-curative treatment for recurred tumor, AFP level at the time of recurrence, size of recurred tumor were independent poor prognostic factors for survival after intrahepatic recurrences (p<0.001).Conclusions:For the patients who had intrahepatic recurrent HCC after surgery, aggressive local treatment can improve the prognosis in selective cases. Further study is necessary to validate this retrospective investigation.
