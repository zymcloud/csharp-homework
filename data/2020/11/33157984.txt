Hepatic carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor, with insidious onset and poor prognosis. However, more hub genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma are unknown. And there are few researches about the conjoint analysis with the hub genes and multi-slice spiral computerized tomography (CT).A total of 100 HCC participates were recruited, who all received the examination of multi-slice spiral CT. Two expression profile data sets (GSE101728 and GSE101685) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GEO2R can perform a command to compare gene expression profiles between groups in order to identify differently expressed genes (DEGs). Functional annotation of DEGs via Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis was made with Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction network were performed. Furthermore, the study could mine of hub genes and explore the correlation with the multi-slice CT. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay was used the exam the expression of hub genes.A total of 10 genes were identified as hub genes with degrees â‰¥10. The hub genes (NIMA Related Kinase 2 [NEK2], Anillin Actin Binding Protein [ANLN], DNA Topoisomerase II Alpha [TOP2A], Centromere Protein F [CENPF], Assembly Factor For Spindle Microtubules [ASPM], Cell Division Cycle 20 [CDC20], Cyclin Dependent Kinase 1 [CDK1], Cyclin B1 [CCNB1], Epithelial Cell Transforming 2 [ECT2], Cyclin B2 [CCNB2]) were identified from the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) network. These hub genes were highly expressed in HCC tissues, and when these genes were highly expressed, the survival prognosis of HCC patients was poor. The type of CT enhancement was significantly related with the expression of NEK2 (P
