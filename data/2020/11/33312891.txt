Liver transplantation (LT) is one of the leading curative therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite recent optimization of transplant selection criteria, including alpha-feto protein, HCC recurrence after LT is still the leading cause of death in these patients. During the last decades, effective systemic treatments for HCC, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy, have been approved. We describe the clinical scenario of a patient with recurrence of HCC five years after LT, who received lenvatinib as first-line systemic therapy to introduce systemic treatment options in this clinical setting. In this opinion review, we detail first and second-line systemic treatment options, focusing on those feasible for patients with recurrent HCC after LT. Several trials have evaluated new drugs to treat HCC patients in first and second-line therapy, but patients with recurrent HCC after LT have been excluded from these trials. Consequently, most of the evidence comes from observational retrospective studies. Whether tyrosine kinase inhibitors will remain the primary therapeutic approach in these patients, due to a relative contraindication for immunotherapy, may be clarified in the near future.
