Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal cancer with limited therapeutic options, and standard therapy with sorafenib provides only modest survival benefits. Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) has been proposed as a driver oncogene, and targeting its receptor, FGFR-4, may provide a better alternative to standard therapy for patients with FGF19-driven tumors. Sixty-three HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were screened for FGF19 expression. Mice bearing high and low FGF19-expressing tumors were treated with FGF401 and/or vinorelbine, and the antitumor activity of both agents was assessed individually and in combination. Tumor vasculature and intratumoral hypoxia were also examined. High FGF19 expression was detected in 14.3% (9 of 63) of the HCC models tested and may represent a good target for HCC treatment. FGF401 potently inhibited the growth of high FGF19-expressing HCC models regardless of FGF19 gene amplification. Furthermore, FGF401 inhibited the FGF19/FGFR-4 signaling pathway, cell proliferation, and hypoxia, induced apoptosis and blood vessel normalization and prolonged the overall survival (OS) of mice bearing high FGF19 tumors. FGF401 synergistically acted with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug vinorelbine to further suppress tumor growth, promote apoptosis, and prolong the OS of mice bearing high FGF19 tumors, with no evidence of increased toxicity. Our study suggests that a subset of patients with high FGF19-expressing HCC tumors could benefit from FGF401 or FGF401/vinorelbine treatment. A high level of FGF19 in a tumor may serve as a potential biomarker for patient selection.
