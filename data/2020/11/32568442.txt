Genetic predisposition of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR has been linked to nonresponse to hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination. We sought to reveal their effects on chronic infection and evolution of HBV and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genetic polymorphisms at HLA-DR enhancer regions were genotyped in 4588 participants using quantitative PCR. HBV mutations were determined by sequencing. A dual-luciferase assay was applied to detect the enhancer activity. Associations between HLA-DR polymorphisms and postoperative prognosis were investigated in another cohort of 397 HBV-infected HCC patients. Variant alleles (rs3135395-T, rs3135338-C and rs477515-T) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of HBV persistence in Chinese patients. rs3135395-T, rs3135338-C, rs477515-T and rs2395178-G also significantly decreased HCC risk. rs3135395-T, rs477515-T and rs2395178-G were inversely associated with the generation of A1762T/G1764A, T1753V and C1653T, the HCC-risk HBV mutations. Multiplicative interactions of the variant genotypes with the HCC-risk HBV mutations were significantly associated with a decreased risk of HCC. In multivariate Cox analysis, rs477515-T independently predicted a favourable prognosis, with a hazard ratio of 0.48 (P = .002). The activity of the HLA-DRB1 enhancer with rs477515-T was significantly higher than that with rs477515-C. The activity of the HLA-DRB1 enhancer with rs477515-T and that with rs477515-C was significantly up-regulated by interferon-Î³ and interleukin-4, respectively. Interleukin-6 significantly inhibited the HLA-DRB1 enhancer activity, and this effect was more evident in those carrying rs477515-T. Polymorphisms predisposing to down-regulation of HLA-DR facilitate the Th1-to-Th2 transition and promote HCC development, possibly via selecting the HCC-risk HBV mutations. This can be transformed into specific prophylaxis of HCC.
