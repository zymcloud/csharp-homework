Epigenetics, an inheritable phenomenon, which influences the expression of gene without altering the DNA sequence, offers a new perspective on the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is projected to account for a significant share of HCC incidence due to the growing prevalence of various metabolic disorders. One of the major molecular mechanisms involved in epigenetic regulation, post-translational histone modification seems to coordinate various aspects of NASH which will further progress to HCC. Mounting evidence suggests that the orchestrated events of cellular and nuclear changes during apoptosis can be regulated by histone modifications. This review focuses on the current advances in the study of acetylation-/methylation-mediated histone modification in apoptosis and the implication of these epigenetic regulations in HCC. The reversibility of epigenetic alterations and the agents that can target these alterations offers novel therapeutic approaches and strategies for drug development. Further molecular mechanistic studies are required to enhance information governing these epigenetic modulators, which will facilitate the design of more effective diagnosis and treatment options.
