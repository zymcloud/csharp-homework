Introduction:We aim to discuss the utility of self-expandable esophageal metal stent (SEMS) in variceal bleeding in challenging cases.Methods:Case description, discussion on patient management and decision-making process in an uncommon situation, from a multidisciplinary point of view.Results:We report a case of a cirrhotic patient with refractory variceal bleeding who underwent a SEMS placement, which remained in situ for 9 months. This decision was based on the initial poor status and short life expectancy, limiting the consideration of other options for lowering portal hypertension, along with an underlying prothrombotic predisposition. However, the patient's general and hepatic improvement and the development of dysphagia led to the SEMS removal, exposing a large esophageal-tracheal fistula.Discussion:Early patient evaluation, risks of long-term SEMS, and life expectancy should be taken in consideration before SEMS placement.
