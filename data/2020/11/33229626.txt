Steroid 5 alpha-reductase 3 (SRD5A3) is an important molecule in glycosylation metabolism and steroid hormone formation. It is differentially expressed in human fetal liver, endometrial cancer and prostate cancer; however, its prognostic value and biological function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Here, bioinformatics analysis was employed to explore the expression and prognostic significance of SRD5A3 in various cancers including HCC. Additionally, clinical specimens of HCC were applied to analyze the expression of SRD5A3. SRD5A3-underexpressed HCC cell lines were established to test the effect of SRD5A3 on cell proliferation in in vitro and in vivo. We found that the elevated expression of SRD5A3 was common in many cancers with poor prognosis. Moreover, public datasets and our specimens revealed that SRD5A3 was also upregulated in HCC tissues and associated with clinical stage and patient's gender. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that higher SRD5A3 level predicted poor overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse-free survival and disease specific survival in HCC patients. Further experiments showed that the lack of SRD5A3 inhibited the growth of HCC. Collectively, these findings indicate that SRD5A3 functions as an oncogene and might serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis and a therapeutic target for HCC.
