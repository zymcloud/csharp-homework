Prevalence and age distribution of tumors is largely unknown in pet rabbits. Currently available studies focused on specific organ systems or specific tumor types and never covered a comparative examination of all tumor types. Previous studies on laboratory rabbits suggested a low tumor prevalence but were mostly limited to young adult animals. In the present study, all tumor types and several tumor-like lesions of all organ systems were analyzed retrospectively in archived pet rabbit samples of all ages. Cases included necropsy cases (n = 2,014) or postmortem tissue samples (n = 102) as well as surgical biopsies (n = 854). All lesions suspicious of neoplasia were reevaluated by histopathology and, when indicated, by immunohistochemistry. Necropsy cases had a tumor prevalence of 14.4% in both sexes or 19.8% in female intact rabbits of all age groups, and up to 47.2% or 66.7%, respectively, in rabbits older than 6 years. Overall, the most common tumor types were uterine adenocarcinoma (prevalence in female intact animals: 13.1%), lymphoma (prevalence: 2.8%), and thymoma (prevalence: 2.1%). Lymphoma, the most common tumor of rabbits â‰¤24 months of age, were of B-cell immunophenotype in 96% of cases and most commonly located in the lymph nodes (57%), gastrointestinal tract (54%), kidneys (48%), spleen (42%), and liver (41%). Tumors accounted for 81.1% of surgical biopsies and mostly comprised cutaneous, mammary, and uterine tumors. In conclusion, tumor types and prevalence varied significantly with respect to age, revealing some differences from previous studies on laboratory rabbits.
