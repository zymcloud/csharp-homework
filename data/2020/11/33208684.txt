Introduction:After hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) interventional therapies, noninvasive vascular diagnostic imaging [duplex, Color/power Doppler ultrasonography, and triphasic computed tomography (CT)] determines the lesion complete/incomplete ablation. The aim was to analyze the usefulness of duplex, color/power Doppler ultrasonography in HCC ablation after percutaneous ablative therapies (PATs).Methods:We included 30 patients with 33 HCCs subjected to duplex/Doppler ultrasonography, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), and triphasic CT, all these before and after PATs.Results:One week after treatment ended, out of 21 lesions with pretreatment positive color-Doppler, signals disappeared in 19 (90.5%) lesions. Out of 29 lesions with pretreatment positive power-Doppler, signals disappeared in 24 (82.8%). Out of 13 lesions with pretreatment intralesional power/duplex arterial signals, signals disappeared in eight (61.5%). There was a significant correlation (P Conclusion:Power-Doppler is a good positive test as intralesional arterial signals in a cirrhotic liver lesion is highly suggestive of HCC. Power-Doppler was sensitive in HCC ablation assessment in pretreatment positive cases only. Both triphasic CT and duplex/Doppler are complementary and the use of different diagnostic modalities after ablation is mandatory.
