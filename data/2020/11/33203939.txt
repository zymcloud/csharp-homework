Chronic liver injury with any etiology can progress to fibrosis and the end-stage diseases cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The progression of liver disease is controlled by a variety of factors, including liver injury, inflammatory cells, inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and the gut microbiome. In the current review, we discuss recent data on a large number of cytokines that play important roles in regulating liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis, and regeneration, with a focus on interferons and T helper (Th) 1, Th2, Th9, Th17, interleukin (IL)-1 family, IL-6 family, and IL-20 family cytokines. Hepatocytes can also produce certain cytokines (such as IL-7, IL-11, and IL-33), and the functions of these cytokines in the liver are briefly summarized. Several cytokines have great therapeutic potential, and some are currently being tested as therapeutic targets in clinical trials for the treatment of liver diseases, which are also described.
