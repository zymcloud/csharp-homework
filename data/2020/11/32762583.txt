Introduction:Camrelizumab (also known as SHR-1210), a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, has been shown to block the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and consequently inhibit the immune escape of tumor cells. Recently, camrelizumab was approved as a second-line drug for previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in China.Areas covered:In this paper, the chemical properties, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of camrelizumab for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma are introduced in detail. The strategy for combination therapy and the potential application of camrelizumab in other solid tumors are briefly described. We performed a systematic review of the literature in PubMed and the following keywords were used: 'SHR-1210,' 'Camrelizumab,' and 'hepatocellular carcinoma.'Expert opinion:Camrelizumab is a selective, humanized, high-affinity IgG4 kappa mAb against PD-1. Camrelizumab showed promising antitumor activity and manageable toxicities and offers a new second-line drug option for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation is a novel but prevalent immune-related dermatologic toxicity of camrelizumab, which is mild, reversible, and predictable. More clinical trials of camrelizumab are ongoing to develop combination therapy strategies and new indications for malignancies.
