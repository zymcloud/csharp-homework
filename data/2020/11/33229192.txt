The hepatocellular carcinoma, as one of the most frequently happened types of cancer in the world, has very complicated intracellular and extracellular molecular underlying pathogenic mechanisms. The role of genome and proteome in the proliferation and metastasis of the hepatocellular carcinoma has been thoroughly investigated, and many theories have been proposed. The subsequent developments, such as the targeted anti-cancer medicine or the treatment strategy, has profoundly influenced the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. As for the transcriptome, it is undeniable that the function of mRNA, rRNA even the long non-coding RNA have been discussed, while as a particular type of RNA-piRNA is not paid enough attention by the academy. piRNA is named because it always interacts with the piwi protein to achieve its physiological functions, with a length that is no more than 30 nucleotides. It is widely distributed in the reproductive organs such as the testis, the ovarian, and the stem cells. Previous studies have elucidated that the piRNA is closely closely related to the maturation of the sperms or the oocytes, even the progression of lung cancer. While the role and underlying molecular mechanisms of piRNA in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma is not thoroughly researched and remained unknown. The authors in this article proposed potential mechanisms of piRNA to initiate the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma. We are hoping to provide a unique perspective to the academy and the following researches.
Hepatocellular carcinoma; PiRNA.
