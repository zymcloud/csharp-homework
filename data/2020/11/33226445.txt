Malignant transformation of fibrous dysplasia lesions has been reported in patients with fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome (FD/MAS). Recently, we have observed an increased risk for breast cancer. In this study, the prevalence of skeletal and extraskeletal malignancies in patients with FD/MAS in the Netherlands was assessed by analyzing data from our cohort of FD/MAS patients, the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA), and the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). We extracted data on sex, age at diagnosis of FD/MAS, type of FD/MAS, type of malignancy, and age at diagnosis of malignancy and histology of bone and malignant tissue when available, including GNAS-mutation analysis from patients' medical records. Standardized Morbidity Ratios (SMRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Twelve malignancies were identified in the LUMC FD/MAS cohort and 100 in the PALGA cohort. In this cohort, SMR was increased for osteosarcoma (19.7, 95% CI 3.5-48.9), cervical cancer (4.93, 95%CI 1.7-8.2), thyroid cancer (3.71, 95% CI 1.1-7.8), prostate cancer (3.08, 95% CI 1.8-4.6), and melanoma (2.01, 95%CI 1.2-3.1). SMRs for pancreatic cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma could not be calculated due to low numbers. The small number of malignancies identified in our FD/MAS cohort precluded the calculation of SMRs for our cohort specifically. Our findings show that patients with FD/MAS appear to have an increased risk for osteosarcoma, cervical, thyroid, and prostate cancer and melanoma. However, these data should be interpreted with caution, as true incidence rates of the identified malignancies may be influenced by the inclusion of only patients with histologically confirmed FD/MAS. The etiology of this increased risk for malignancies still needs to be elucidated.
