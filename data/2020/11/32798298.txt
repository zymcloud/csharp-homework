Background:Preclinical observations suggested a synergistic effect of sorafenib (SFN) and irinotecan (CPT-11) in hepatoblastoma (HB). Thus, we conducted a feasibility study of fractionated CPT-11 combined with SFN to develop a new therapy against relapsed/refractory pediatric hepatic cancer (HC).Procedure:The study was originally designed as a phase I, standard 3+3 dose-finding study to evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) for the regimen and the optimal CPT-11 dose in combination with SFN against relapsed/refractory pediatric HC, including HB and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The enrolled patients received SFN at 200 mg/m2 every 12 hours or 400 mg/m2 every 24 hours daily combined with CPT-11 at 20 mg/m2 /day on days 1 to 5 as an initial level 1 dose.Results:Six patients with HB (n = 4) or HCC (n = 2) were enrolled and treated with CPT-11 dose level 1. The median age at enrollment was 8.7 (6.2-16.3) years. All patients received platinum-containing chemotherapy, and five or two patients received CPT-11 or SFN before enrollment, respectively. Regimen toxicities were evaluable in all patients. One of six patients experienced a grade 4 transaminase levels increase, which was defined as a DLT per protocol. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and a grade 3 transaminase level increase occurred in three patients and one patient, respectively. All patients reported grade 1/2 toxicities such as anemia, skin toxicity, gastrointestinal symptoms, and hypoalbuminemia.Conclusions:Although the study was terminated before determining the maximum-tolerated CPT-11 dose, SFN and CPT-11 at the level 1 dose were concluded to be tolerable in pediatric patients with HC.
