Liver fibrosis can develop into liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma substantially without effective available treatment currently due to rarely characterized molecular pathogenesis. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1(IDO1) can be detected on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and modulates various immune responses. However, the role of IDO1 in the regulation of dendritic cells (DCs) during liver fibrosis is rarely reported. Here, we found that hepatic IDO1 was up-regulated during CCL4-induced liver fibrosis, which accompanied by a significant decrease in the frequencies of CD11c+CD80+, CD11c+CD86+, CD11c+CD40+ and CD11c+MHCII+ cells and a reduction in the subsequent T cell proliferation rate, whereas these changes were reversed significantly in IDO1-/- mice. Overexpressing IDO1 by adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) significantly inhibited the maturation status of DCs, worsened fibrosis. In vitro studies showed that significantly elevated CD80, CD86, CD40 and MHCII expression were observed in BMDCs derived from IDO1-/- mice. Moreover, the maturation of BMDCs derived from WT mice were significantly increased after stimulated with IDO1 inhibitor (1-methyl- D -tryptophan). Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key regulator of the cellular adaptive response to oxidative insults and inflammation, exhibited a markedly decrease in the liver of WT fibrotic mice, nevertheless, knockout of IDO1 enhanced the protein level of Nrf2. Moreover, the expression of IDO1 and Nrf2 exhibited inverse colocalization pattern suggesting that ectopically expressed IDO1 down-regulated Nrf2. Additionally, up-regulation of IDO1 was also observed in the livers of Nrf2-/- fibrotic mice. Taken together, these data uncovered mutual antagonism between IDO1 and Nrf2 on the maturation status of DCs during hepatic fibrosis.
