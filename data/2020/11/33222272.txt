Background:It is unknown whether patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who achieved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance spontaneously or following anti-viral therapy have similar clinical outcomes.Aim:To compare the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with CHB who either cleared HBsAg spontaneously or following anti-viral therapy METHODS: Adult CHB-monoinfected patients who cleared HBsAg between January 2000 and March 2019 were identified from a territory-wide database in Hong Kong. Patients with liver transplantation and/or HCC before HBsAg loss were excluded. Patients' demographics, comorbidities, anti-viral treatment, laboratory parameters and HCC development were analysed.Results:Of 7,124 identified patients with CHB who cleared HBsAg, mean age was 58.1 Â± 13.8 years; 4,340 (60.9%) were male; 451 (6.3%) had cirrhosis; 5,917 (83.1%) and 1,207 (16.9%) had spontaneous and nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-induced HBsAg seroclearance, respectively. Most patients had normal liver function at HBsAg loss. Patients with NA-induced HBsAg seroclearance were younger, and more likely to be male and cirrhotic than patients with spontaneous HBsAg loss. At a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 4.3 (2.2-7.6) years, 97 (1.6%) and 16 (1.3%) patients with spontaneous and NA-induced HBsAg loss developed HCC, respectively. Patients who achieved NA-induced HBsAg loss had comparable HCC risk as those with spontaneous HBsAg loss (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.43-1.32, P = 0.323). The results remained robust in propensity score weighting and matching analyses.Conclusion:The HCC risk was similarly low after either spontaneous or NA-induced HBsAg seroclearance in a territory-wide cohort of patients with CHB who had cleared HBsAg.
