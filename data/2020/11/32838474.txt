Aim:Esophageal variceal ligation (EVL) is usually carried out to decrease the risk of hemorrhage. Several complications have been reported with the procedure, including bleeding from ligation-induced esophageal ulcers or heartburn. However, there is scant evidence for gastroesophageal reflux caused by EVL. The aim of this study was to assess 24-h pH monitoring in the esophagogastric junction before and after EVL and the bleeding rate for 18 months.Methods:We undertook this single-center prospective trial in Kitasato University Hospital (Sagamihara, Japan). We included patients with cirrhosis who were Child-Pugh classification A or B, without uncontrollable hepatocellular carcinoma, and had F2 or larger esophageal varices, and/or were red color sign (RC) positive. The study period was from July 2012 through September 2017 for 32 patients enrolled in this study and followed up until March 2019.Results:Baseline characteristics were: median Child-Pugh score, 6; and mean age, 64.3 years. Before and after EVL, the median 24-h under pH 4 holding time percentages of all patients were 0.6% (range, 0-5.6%) and 0.95% (range, 0-50.6%), respectively, without a significant difference (P = 0.107). We could not find any G3 or G4 adverse events during this study, and 75% of the patients who had already suffered from moderate gastroesophageal reflux became worse after EVL (P = 0.18) and required antacid therapies. There were no patients with hemorrhage from esophageal varices.Conclusions:Esophageal variceal ligation for esophageal varices did not significantly change gastroesophageal reflux. Therefore, acid suppressive therapy might be unnecessary for patients who do not suffer from gastroesophageal reflux after EVL.
