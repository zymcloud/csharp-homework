With an increase in sedentary lifestyle and dietary over nutrition, obesity has become one of the major public health problems worldwide and is a prevalent predisposing risk factor to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic liver disease in Western developed countries. NAFLD represents a series of diseased states ranging from non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to fibrosis and eventually to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the only effective treatment to cure end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation. Macrophages have been reported to play a crucial role in the progression of NAFLD, thereby are a potential target for therapy. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on the role of macrophages and inflammatory signalling pathways associated with obesity and chronic liver inflammation, and their contribution to NAFLD development and progression.
