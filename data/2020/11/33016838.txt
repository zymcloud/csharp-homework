Background:Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is crucial in providing more effective therapies. As routine laboratory variables are readily accessible, this study aimed to develop a simple non-invasive model for predicting hepatocellular cancer.Methods:Two groups of patients were recruited: an estimation group (n = 300) and a validation group (n = 625). Each comprised two categories: hepatocellular cancer and liver cirrhosis. Logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to develop and validate the HCC-Mark model comprising AFP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, albumin and platelet count. This model was tested in cancer patients classified by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), Cancer of Liver Italian Program (CLIP) and Okuda systems, and was compared with other non-invasive models for predicting hepatocellular cancer.Results:HCC-Mark produced a ROC AUC of 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.90) for discriminating hepatocellular carcinoma from liver cirrhosis in the estimation group and 0.90 (0.86-0.90) in the validation group (both p Conclusion:HCC-Mark is an accurate and validated model for the detection of hepatocellular cancer and certain of its clinical features.
