Background and study aims:The demand for treatments for viral hepatitis using direct antiviral agents (DAAs) has increased; however, few real-world clinical studies are available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir combined with ribavirin for patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 2 (GT2).Patients and methods:A total of 106 consecutive CHC GT2 patients treated with sofosbuvir plus ribavirin between May 2016 and August 2018 (median age: 52.5 years, male: 51 [48.1%], treatment-na√Øve patients: 98 [92.5%]) were analyzed. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12). The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of side effects during treatment.Results:Of a total of 106 patients with CHC GT2, 103 were genotype 2a (97.2%), and 3 were 2b (2.8%). SVR12 was confirmed in 105 of 106 patients (99.1%). The one patient with treatment failure had combined liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Twenty-five patients had liver cirrhosis in addition to hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP)-A, n = 24; C, n = 1), and SVR12 was confirmed in 24 of these patients (96.0%). The mean HCV RNA titer was 2,629,159 IU/ml. Reductions in haemoglobin levels occurred in 23 patients during treatment (3.0 mg/dL, mean), and consequently, ribavirin dose reduction was required (365.2 mg, mean).Conclusion:Sofosbuvir plus ribavirin was highly effective for the treatment of patients with CHC GT2 and had no serious, treatment-related adverse effects.
