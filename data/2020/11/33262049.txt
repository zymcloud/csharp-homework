Background:The aim of this study was to establish a quantitative equation to predict microvascular invasion (MVI) for patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This retrospective study included 219 patients with resected HCC from 2004 to 2015. All had available three pre-operative serological markers (alfa-feto protein (AFP), fucosylated AFP (AFP-L3), and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP)), and one imaging marker (tumor to liver ratio of SUVmax (TLR) by 18F-FDG-PET). A multiple linear regression model for predicting MVI was developed (2004-2009, n = 111) and then validated (2010-2015, n = 108). Further, impact on the obtained model on survival outcomes was assessed.Results:Using the derivation cohort, following equation was developed; MVI probability (%) = 14.2 × log10DCP + 9.9 × TLR - 22.0. This model resulted in an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.806 and 0.751, in the derivation and validation cohort, respectively. Furthermore, MVI probability ≥40% determined by ROC analysis was associated with worse overall survival and recurrence-free survival in the derivation and the validation cohort (all p < 0.05).Conclusion:A quantitative model, using DCP and TLR, was able to preoperatively predict with good performance MVI and long-term outcomes in patients with HCC after liver resection.
