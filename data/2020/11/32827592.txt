Aims:The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients following transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Time to progression (TTP) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in competing risk model were compared in patients with (n = 289) or without (n = 763) T2DM. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce bias between the two groups. Multivariate competing risk regression was used to evaluate independent risk factors for TTP and CSM.Results:The T2DM group showed significantly worse 5-year TTP and CSM rates than the non-T2DM group both in the whole cohort (n = 1052) and the PSM cohort (n = 514) (81.3% vs. 70.9%, P Conclusions:T2DM worsened the long-term survival of intermediate-stage HCC patients who underwent TACE, especially in patients with cirrhosis.
