Our previous studies have indicated that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) SPRY4 intronic transcript 1 (SPRY4-IT1) was highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it still remained unclear how SPRY4-IT1 worked in tumorgenesis in HCC. In this study, we tested the overexpression of SPRY4-IT1 in HCC tissues and cells through a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analyses showed that the upregulation had an association with the tumor node metastasis stage, thrombin time, and alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, SPRY4-IT1 could be involved in cell proliferation, metastasis, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in HCC in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing and transcriptome analysis were carried out to explore the mechanism of SPRY4-IT1 in HCC. With SPRY4-IT1 being knocked down or overexpressed, the level of proteins in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway changed. We detected the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL) as a SPRY4-IT1 interacting protein through RNA pull-down assay and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, then verified through RNA immunoprecipitation. Downregulation of HNRNPL induced the change of proteins observed on SPRY4-IT1 downregulation revealing the SPRY4-IT1: HNRNPL complex in the TNF signaling pathway and EMT process in HCC. In general, our experimental data and analysis demonstrated the role of SPRY4-IT1 in promoting progress and metastasis of HCC by the TNF signaling pathway.
