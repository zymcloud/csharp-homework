Nod2 is a pattern recognition receptor that modulates host innate immune responses and protects from inflammation, steatosis, and obesity. Obesity and inflammation are risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma, however, the role of Nod2 in obesity-dependent hepatic tumorigenesis is not known. Here we tested the hypothesis that Nod2 protects from high fat diet (HFD)-dependent hepatic cancer. We used an obesity-dependent hepatic tumor model. WT and Nod2-/- mice were treated with the carcinogen dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and maintained on HFD. Nod2-/- mice treated with DMBA and maintained on HFD gain significantly more weight and develop more liver tumors than similarly treated WT mice. Livers of Nod2-/- tumorigenic mice had increased expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, immune responses, and cholesterol biosynthesis, increased infiltration of neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, and T cells, and increased activation of STAT3 and ERK during the later stages of tumorigenesis. Bioinformatic analyses of genes with differential expression predicted an increase in cancer, immune, and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. In summary, we have identified a novel role for Nod2 and demonstrate that Nod2 protects from HFD-dependent liver malignancy and this protection is accompanied by decreased cell proliferation, inflammation, steroid biosynthesis, neutrophils and macrophages infiltration, and STAT3 and MAPK signaling in the liver.
