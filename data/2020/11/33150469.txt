Purpose:To compare the technical efficacy and complications of the transarterial injection of a miriplatin-iodized oil suspension combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) in the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:This retrospective study included 123 HCCs in 101 patients treated with the transarterial injection of a miriplatin-iodized oil suspension and RFA (MPT-RFA) (maximum diameter: 1.5 [Formula: see text] 0.5 cm, range: 0.6-3.0 cm) and 68 HCCs in 49 patients treated with the transarterial injection of a miriplatin-iodized oil suspension and MWA (MPT-MWA) (maximum diameter: 1.6 [Formula: see text] 0.7 cm, range: 0.5-3.0 cm). Technical success was defined as the achievement of an ablative margin of at least 5 mm for each tumor. Technical success, complications, and local tumor progression were compared between the two groups.Results:The initial technical success rate was significantly higher with MPT-MWA (94.1%) than with MPT-RFA (76.4%; P = 0.003). The number of treatment sessions per nodule was significantly lower with MPT-MWA (1.1) than with MPT-RFA (1.3) (P = 0.004). The major complication rates were similar with MPT-RFA (5.8%) and MPT-MWA (2.7%) (P = 0.391). The one-year local tumor progression rate was similar between MPT-RFA (0%) and MPT-MWA (0%) (P = 0.73).Conclusion:MPT-MWA may have improved therapeutic efficiency in the treatment of small HCCs.
