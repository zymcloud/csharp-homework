Aims:This study assessed the real-world United States (US) treatment patterns and the associated economic burden in patients diagnosed with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The MarketScan database was used to identify patients newly diagnosed with HCC who received systemic therapy between 2011 and 2018 and continuously enrolled for ≥6 months (baseline period) prior and ≥1 month following HCC diagnosis. Treatment patterns (systemic and locoregional therapy), healthcare resource utilization, and costs were reported during follow-up.Results:The final sample included 1580 patients (median age, 61; 78% male; median follow up, 8.7 months). The most common first line of therapy (LOT) was sorafenib (78%). The median time from HCC diagnosis to start of sorafenib was 43 days, and the median duration of sorafenib therapy was 60 days. Only 17% of patients received second LOT, and non-sorafenib treatment use increased to 66% (mostly chemotherapy combination). Transarterial chemoembolization was the most commonly observed locoregional therapy prior to the first LOT. The multivariable-adjusted average all-cause total cost among sorafenib treated patients was $17,642 (95% CI: $16,711-$18,558) per-patient per-month), of which $11,393 were HCC-specific.Conclusions:In patients who received first-line therapy for HCC, the duration of therapy was short (potentially due to progression or tolerability). Most patients did not continue to second-line therapy. Despite the short duration of therapy, HCC patients still incur a high economic burden, and there is a need for more effective and tolerable treatments.
