Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of hepatic disorders. It represents a wide range of chronic liver diseases in patients with no history of significant alcohol consumption, starting with simple steatosis and progressing towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is usually associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. This disease has mostly been studied in obese individuals; however, it has been widely reported and studied among the lean/non-obese population in recent years. The pathogenesis of NAFLD in non-obese patients is associated with various genetic predispositions, particularly a patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 G allele polymorphism, which results in the accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and resistance to insulin. Additionally, dietary factors such as high fructose consumption seem to play a substantial role in the pathology of non-obese NAFLD. Although there is not enough evidence on the treatment of NAFLD in non-obese patients, the standard approach is to advise altering one's lifestyle in order to diminish visceral adiposity. Dietary modification, weight loss, and increased physical activity are highly recommended. We aimed to review and summarize the existing information on the prevalence, pathogenesis, genetic predispositions, diagnosis, and treatment of NAFLD in non-obese patients according to the latest literature.
