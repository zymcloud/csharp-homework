Background:Recently, many studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abnormally expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and may serve as a potential molecular biomarker to evaluate the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we accomplished a meta-analysis built on current studies to assess the prognostic value of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The PubMed database was carefully searched to collect all eligible studies until February 20, 2019. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the overall survival, relapse-free survival, and progression-free survival were calculated to evaluate the prognostic significance of lncRNAs expression in hepatocellular carcinoma using Stata12.0 software. Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were also evaluated.Results:The results showed that the expression level of lncRNAs was significantly correlated with clinical outcomes. Abnormally expressed lncRNAs predicted poor overall survival (HR=2.19, 95% CI: 1.99-2.42, P<0.001; I2=44.7%, P=0.005), relapse-free survival (HR=2.68, 95% CI: 1.74-4.14, P<0.001; I2=0.0%, P=0.763) and progression-free survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HR=2.44, 95% CI: 1.53-3.89, P<0.001; I2=0.0%, P=0.336). Statistical significance was also noted in subgroup meta-analyses that were stratified by follow-up time, cutoff value, and quality score. Moreover, the pooled results indicated that lncRNAs expression was significantly associated with tumor size (HR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.24-1.79), tumor number (HR=1.34, 95% CI: 1.08-1.66), and tumor node metastasis stage (HR=2.10, 95% CI: 1.48-2.99), but not liver cirrhosis and tumor differentiation (P>0.05).Conclusions:This meta-analysis indicates that lncRNAs are strongly associated with prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma and may serve as a promising indicator for prognostic evaluation of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. But larger clinical studies are needed to verify its feasibility.
