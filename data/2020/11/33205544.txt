Background & aims:Liver transplantation (LTx) is one of the most effective treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, tumour recurrence after LTx often leads to poor outcomes. This study investigated the value of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) as a predictor of recurrence following LTx in patients with HCC.Methods:This analysis included 193 patients with HCC who underwent LTx at our institute and accepted pre- and post-operative CTC detection; 38 were selected for serial CTC monitoring. The predictive value of CTCs for tumour recurrence in patients with HCC following LTx was evaluated. Single-cell whole genome sequencing was used to characterize CTCs.Results:Overall, the CTC burden decreased after LTx (P Conclusions:CTCs may be a useful biomarker to evaluate recurrence risk following LTx in patients with HCC. Evaluation based on CTC detection may enhance the post-transplant management of HCC, and improve the therapeutic efficacy of LTx.
