Background:Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main factor affecting the prognosis of patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation (LT). In this study, we investigated the influencing factors of tumor recurrence and survival after LT for HCC, especially the long-term correlation with elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG).Methods:Clinical data from 165 patients with HCC after LT in the General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA between January 2013 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates, demographic characteristics, tumor characteristics, and surgical and postoperative data were evaluated.Results:Among 165 patients, 144 completed over 60 months of follow-up; the median follow-up period was more than 36 months. DFS rates were 76.97%, 51.52%, and 34.73% for 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The OS rate for 5 years was 40.28%. Independent risk factors for 1-year DFS were maximum tumor diameter >5 cm, age 5 cm, capsular invasion, and FBG ≥6.1 mmol/L. Independent risk factors for OS were maximum tumor diameter >5 cm, capsular invasion, and FBG ≥6.1 mmol/L.Conclusion:Elevated FBG after LT for HCC may promote medium- to long-term tumor recurrence and affect OS.
