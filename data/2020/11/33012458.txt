Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality, but unlike other leading causes of cancer death, HCC is increasing in mortality and burden of management. Management of HCC is unique because it usually arises in a diseased liver, which itself may be a driver of mortality. Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) for the management of complex diseases are becoming more common, but are especially needed in the management of patients with HCC. Liver cancer MDTs are used in most centers providing comprehensive care for patients with HCC, and should be considered the standard of care for these patients.
