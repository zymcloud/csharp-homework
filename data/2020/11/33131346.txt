BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer. First-line treatment options for unresectable HCC include sorafenib, lenvatinib, selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). The present study reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of first-line therapies for unresectable HCC in TACE-ineligible patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify RCTs of first-line treatments for TACE-ineligible patients with unresectable HCC. Data on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were extracted and a contrast-based Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. RESULTS The SLR identified three RCTs: two comparing Y-90 resin microspheres with sorafenib, and one comparing sorafenib with lenvatinib. No RCTs were identified comparing other SIRT technologies with any other approved first-line HCC therapies. The NMA showed no significant OS differences between Y-90 resin microspheres and sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.79-1.08) or lenvatinib (HR: 0.88, 95% CrI: 0.63-1.22). CONCLUSIONS An SLR and NMA showed no significant differences between sorafenib, lenvatinib and Y-90 resin microspheres in treating unresectable HCC. RCT evidence was not available for any other SIRT technologies and an evaluation of their relative efficacy was therefore not possible.
