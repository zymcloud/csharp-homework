Background/aims:Recently, lenvatinib demonstrated non-inferiority to sorafenib in terms of overall survival (OS) in a randomized phase III study that was conducted at 154 sites in 20 countries. Here, we investigated treatment outcomes and safety of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib and identified independent predictors of poor outcomes, including shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in Korean patients with unresectable HCC.Methods:Patients with advanced HCC treated with lenvatinib or sorafenib at Yonsei Liver Center, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine between October 2018 to October 2019, were considered eligible. Response evaluation was performed according to the modified RECIST criteria.Results:The lenvatinib arm had a significantly lower proportion of patients who received prior anti-HCC treatments (47.7% vs. 78.7%; PConclusions:Patients treated with lenvatinib demonstrated significantly longer PFS than those treated with sorafenib. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in mortality rates between the two groups, which indicated that lenvatinib is non-inferior to sorafenib in terms of OS.
