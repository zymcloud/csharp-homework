Background and aims:The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway is important for linking inflammation and tumorigenesis. Here, we characterized an NF-κB signaling activation-induced long intergenic noncoding (LINC) RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LINC00665, that contributes to the enhanced cell proliferation of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo.Approach and results:LINC00665 physically interacts with the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR), enhances its activation, and maintains its protein stability by blocking ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation, resulting in a positive feedback regulation of NF-κB signaling in HCC cells. Notably, patients with HCC and higher LINC00665 have poorer outcomes in the clinic.Conclusions:Our findings indicate that LINC00665 is involved in the NF-κB signaling activation in HCC cells and that the inflammatory LINC00665/PKR/NF-κB loop plays important oncogenic roles in hepatic cancer progression and may be a potential therapeutic target.
