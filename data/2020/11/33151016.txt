Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a major cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and mortality. Eliminating hepatitis C virus (HCV) can greatly improve long-term outcomes. Several direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), including sofosbuvir (SOF) plus different NS5A inhibitors, as well as non-SOF-based DAAs, including glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB), have been approved for treating CHC genotype-2 (GT-2) patients in Taiwan. However, there is limited real-world effectiveness data regarding these different regimens. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the real-world efficacy in CHC GT-2 patients who underwent these DAA regimens. We retrospectively enrolled CHC GT-2 patients who were treated with SOF-based DAAs or GLE/PIB at a single medical center. A total of 704 enrolled patients were treated with either SOF + ribavirin (RBV), SOF/daclatasvir (DCV) ± RBV, SOF/ledipasvir (LDV) ± RBV, SOF/velpatasvir (VEL) ± RBV, or with GLE/PIB. The overall sustained virological response (SVR) rate was 97.9%. The SVR rate was significantly lower in the SOF + RBV group (95.6%) than in the non-SOF + RBV (98.9%) group, especially compared to the SOF/DCV (100%) and GLE/PIB groups (99.5%). Among patients treated with SOF + RBV, cirrhotic patients had significantly lower SVR rates than noncirrhotic patients (89.4% vs 98.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with a younger age, hepatitis B virus coinfection, baseline cirrhosis, or those who received SOF + RBV were less likely to achieve SVR. In conclusion, for CHC GT-2 patients, SOF in combination with DCV, LDV, or VEL, as well as GLE/PIB, achieved similar high efficacies, regardless of cirrhosis, treatment experience, or chronic kidney disease status. Therefore, the use of DAA therapy to eradicate HCV should not be delayed in these populations.
