Background and aim:After the introduction of the contrast-enhanced ultrasound Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (CEUS LI-RADS), several studies have reported on its performance, but the reported data vary considerably. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic performance of CEUS LI-RADS in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and investigate the causes of study heterogeneity.Methods:Original studies published until May 30, 2020, investigating the diagnostic performance of CEUS LI-RADS were identified in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Meta-analytic summary sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of HCC were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the causes of study heterogeneity.Results:Of the 105 articles screened, eight studies were finally analyzed (5428 hepatic observations). The summary sensitivity and specificity of CEUS LI-RADS category 5 (LR-5) for diagnosing HCC were 73% [95% confidence interval (CI) 65-79%; I2 = 93%] and 95% (95% CI 91-97%; I2 = 89%), respectively. Substantial study heterogeneity was noted in both sensitivity and specificity. Study heterogeneity was significantly associated with the proportion of cases of HCC and the type of reference standard (p â‰¤ 0.05).Conclusion:CEUS LI-RADS had high pooled specificity for diagnosing HCC but suboptimal pooled sensitivity. Substantial study heterogeneity was found, which was significantly associated with the proportion of cases of HCC and the type of reference standard.
