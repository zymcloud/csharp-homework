We have read the remarkable report by Rich N et al. and would like to propose that the tumor growth model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) should be based on a distributed algorithm that includes damping factors and not on a simple exponential function. We would like to share some of our views on growth model of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that may differ from the valuable report by Rich N and colleagues.
