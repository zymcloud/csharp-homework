Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a fatal malignancy, is highly prevalent in China. Recently, tremendous achievements have been made in HCC, both in the clinical management and the understanding of cancer biology. The discovery and application of novel serum biomarkers, such as proteins, miRNAs, and cfDNA (cell-free circulating DNA) methylation will facilitate the early management of HCC. Improvements in radiological and computational technology have made the practice of precision liver surgery a true reality. The emergence of novel molecular targeted therapies, immunotherapy and their combinations has significantly prolonged patient survival rate, but the therapeutic breakthroughs are still needed. Integrated multi-omics analysis has broadened our understanding of HCC pathogenesis, providing an unprecedented molecular characterization of HCC and revealing new therapeutic opportunities. Technological innovations and revolutions such as single-cell sequencing, genome editing, and innovative drug research and development will greatly accelerate our understanding of HCC biology and bring new therapeutic opportunities. Nevertheless, HCC is a highly heterogeneous and treatment-refractory malignancy, therefore deep insights into the biology of the disease and novel therapies for HCC remain an unmet medical need.
