Background:Laparoscopic major liver resection, such as laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy (LLH), is still perceived as a complicated procedure due to technical difficulties and slow learning curve. The study introduced an optimized procedure using the liver parenchyma transection-first approach and investigated its advantages on surgical outcomes by comparison with the conventional hilar dissection approach for LLH.Methods:Between January 2015 and May 2019, 96 patients who underwent laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were enrolled in the study. Among these, 41 patients underwent the liver parenchyma transection-first approach (LP-first group) and the other 55 underwent the conventional hilar dissection approach (conventional group). A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compare the perioperative and long-term oncological outcomes of the two groups.Results:After 1:1 PSM, 37 patients in each group were selected for further analysis. The LP-first group was associated with shorter median operative time (210 vs 235 min, P = 0.035) and less blood loss (200 vs 300 mL, P = 0.410). In addition, no statistical differences were found in overall complications between the two groups (8.1% vs 24.3%, P = 0.058). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of 1-year and 3-year disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.608) and overall survival (OS, P = 0.414).Conclusion:The prior liver parenchyma approach for LLH is safe and reproducible in selected patients, which showed improved perioperative outcomes and comparable long-term oncological outcomes compared with the conventional approach.
