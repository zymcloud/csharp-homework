Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become an easily treatable disease after the introduction of sofosbuvir-based direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens. This is a large single center experience of changing severity and outcome profile of HCV-related liver disease after availability of DAAs.Methods:A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected liver transplantation (LT) database of adults (age > 18 years at the time of LT) was performed from June 2010 to July 2018. A total of 410 patients (including 26 co-infection with hepatitis B) underwent LT for hepatitis C-related decompensated cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) out of 1754 adult transplantation in the defined period.Results:The study group comprised of 296 males and 114 females aged 52.1 ± 7.9 years. HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis and/or HCC as indication of LT was present in 289/1016 (28.4%) during 2010-2014, which was reduced to 121/738 (16.3%) during 2015-2018 (p = 0.000). The LT recipients for HCV-related cirrhosis had significantly lower Child's and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score during 2015-2018 as compared to that during 2010-2014; Child's score was 7.9 ± 2.2 vs. 8.6 ± 2.1, p = 0.003; MELD score was 13.9 ± 5.3 vs. 17.1 ± 5.8, p = 0.000, respectively. There was a trend towards better survival in HCV patients during 2015-2018 as compared to that during 2010-2014. Significantly more patients had HCV RNA negative status before LT during 2015-2018 (38.8% vs. 13%, p = 0.000); moreover, the proportion of LT for decompensated cirrhosis (without HCC) decreased significantly in the latter period, 64.0% vs. 42.1% (p = 0.000).Conclusion:In the DAA era, HCV as an indication for LT has decreased and patients have less severe disease at transplantation. There is a trend towards better patient survival.
