Multidrug resistance (MDR) counteracts the efficiency of sorafenib, an important first-line therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sirtuins (SIRTs) 1 and 2 are associated with tumor progression and MDR. We treated 2D and 3D cultures (which mimic the features of in vivo tumors) from HCC cells with sorafenib alone or in the presence of SIRTs 1 and 2 inhibitors (cambinol or EX-527; combined treatments). Cultures subjected to combined treatments showed a greater fall in cellular viability, proliferation (PCNA, cyclin D1 and Ki-67 expression and cell cycle analysis), migration and invasion when compared with cultures treated only with sorafenib. Similarly, combined treatments produced more apoptosis (annexin V/PI, caspase-3/7 activity) than sorafenib alone. Since cell cycle dysregulation and apoptotic blockage are reported mechanisms of MDR, the modulation found in PCNA, cyclin D1, Ki-67 and caspase-3/7 proteins by cambinol and EX-527 are probably playing a role in enhancing the sensitivity of HCC cell lines to sorafenib. EX-527 reduced MRP3 and BCRP expression in sorafenib-treated HCC cells. Since ABC transporters contribute to MDR, MRP3 and BCRP could be also influencing in the response of HCC cells to sorafenib. Overall, 2D and 3D cultures behave similarly except that 3D cultures were less sensitive to treatments, reinforcing the clinical relevance of the current study. Findings presented in this manuscript support a potential application for SIRTs 1 and 2 inhibitors since we demonstrated that these compounds enhance the inhibitory effect of sorafenib upon treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma cells lines.
