Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in Taiwan. The Taiwan Liver Cancer Association and the Gastroenterological Society of Taiwan had established a management consensus guideline in 2016. The current recommendations focus on updating critical issues regarding the management of HCC, including surveillance, diagnosis, and systemic treatment. For surveillance, the updated guideline suggests the role of dynamic computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in selected patients. For diagnosis, this update incorporates CEUS and recognizes the role of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. For systemic therapy, the updated guideline summarizes the multiple choices of targeted therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and the combination of both. Through this update of the management consensus guideline, patients with HCC can benefit from receiving optimal diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.
