With advances in genome and transcriptome research technology, the function and mechanism of lncRNAs in physiological and pathological states have been gradually revealed. Nuclear Enriched Abundant Transcript 1 (NEAT1, a long non-coding RNA), a vital component of paraspeckles, plays an indispensable role in the formation and integrity of paraspeckles. Throughout the research history, NEAT1 is mostly aberrantly upregulated in various cancers, and high expression of NEAT1 often contributes to poor prognosis of patients. Notably, the role and mechanism of NEAT1 in liver diseases have been increasingly reported. NEAT1 accelerates the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, while exerting a protective role in the pathogenesis of acute-on-chronic liver failure by inhibiting the inflammatory response. In this review, we will elaborate on relevant studies on the different casting of NEAT1 in liver diseases, especially focusing on its regulatory mechanisms and new opportunities for alcoholic liver disease.
