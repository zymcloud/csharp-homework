Objectives:To investigate whether the increased soft tissue contrast of virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) obtained from a spectral detector computed tomography (SDCT) system improves washout assessment of arterially hyper-enhancing liver lesions.Methods:Fifty-nine arterially hyper-enhancing lesions in 31 patients (age 65 ± 9 years, M/W 20/11) were included in this IRB-approved study. All patients underwent multi-phase SDCT for HCC screening. MRI, CEUS or biopsy within 3 months served as standard of reference to classify lesions as LiRADS 3 or 4/5. VMIs and conventional images (CIs) were reconstructed. Visual analysis was performed on 40, 60, and 80 kiloelectronvolt (keV) and CIs by 3 radiologists. Presence and visibility of washout were assessed; image quality and confidence of washout evaluation were evaluated on 5-point Likert scales. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), lesion-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (|HUlesion-HUliver|/SDliver) and washout (|HUlesion-HUliver|) were calculated. Statistical assessment was performed using ANOVA and Wilcoxon test.Results:On subjective lesion analysis, the highest level of diagnostic confidence and highest sensitivity for the detection of lesion washout were found for 40-keV VMIs (40 keV vs. CI, 81.3 vs. 71.3%). Image quality parameters were significantly better in low-kiloelectronvolt VMIs than in CIs (p liver: 40 keV vs. CIs, 12.5 ± 4.1 vs. 5.6 ± 1.6). In LiRADS 4/5 lesions, CNR and quantitative washout values were significantly higher in 40-keV VMIs compared to CIs (p < 0.05; e.g. CNR and washout in 40 keV vs. CIs, 2.3 ± 1.6 vs. 0.8 ± 0.5 and 29.0 ± 19.1 vs. 12.9 ± 6.9 HU, respectively).Conclusion:By increasing lesion contrast, low-kiloelectronvolt VMIs obtained from SDCT improve washout assessment of hyper-enhancing liver lesions with respect to washout visibility and diagnostic confidence.Key points:• Low-kiloelectronvolt virtual monoenergetic images from spectral detector CT facilitate washout assessment in arterially hyper-enhancing liver lesions. • Image quality and quantitative washout parameters as well as subjective washout visibility and diagnostic confidence benefit from low-kiloelectronvolt virtual monoenergetic images.
