Background/aim:To evaluate the predictive value of metabolic activity assessed by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing Yttrium-90 (Y-90) transarterial radioembolization (TARE).Methods:Between 2009 and 2013, a total of 40 patients with HCC were treated with Y-90 TARE. Before each treatment, 18 F-FDG PET/CT was performed. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and tumor-to-non-tumorous liver uptake ratio (TLR; tumor SUVmax/non-tumorous liver mean SUV) were measured for each patient. Tumor response was evaluated in accordance with modified RECIST criteria at 3-month intervals after Y-90 TARE. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-squared test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:The median patient age was 56.5 years. Twenty-nine patients (72.5%) were men; 36 patients (90.0%) were classified as Child-Pugh class A. Thirty-three patients (82.5%) showed disease control in treated lesions at 3 months after Y-90 TARE. Eleven patients (27.5%) showed progression-free survival. However, low and high TLR (relative to the median value of 2.1) did not affect rates of disease control, progression-free survival, or overall survival. No predictive factors could be identified for disease progression or death in patients with HCC undergoing Y-90 TARE.Conclusions:TLR-based stratification is a simple method, but it may not be useful in treatment planning for HCC patient undergoing Y-90 TARE. Further studies with large number of patients are needed.
