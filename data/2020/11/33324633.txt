Glycogen metabolism plays a key role in tumorigenesis. High expression levels of glycogen phosphorylase B (PYGB) were reported in several cancers and might be served as a prognostic biomarker for cancer from precancerous lesions. Previous studies indicated the high expression of PYGB in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. However, the detailed roles of PYGB in HCC, as well as the regulatory mechanisms, are still unclear. In this study, we confirmed that PYGB was overexpressed in HCC tissues. PYGB overexpression was significantly associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype and poor prognosis of HCC patients. Functionally, PYGB knockdown suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, as well as tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that PYGB overexpression might enhance epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC. Moreover, miR-101-3p was identified to post-transcriptionally inhibit the expression of PYGB via binding to 3'-UTR of PYGB. Overexpression of PYGB antagonized the regulatory effect of miR-101-3p on cell proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC cells. In summary, our results suggest that miR-101-3p/PYGB axis has an important role in HCC and PYGB could be served as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for improving the prognosis of HCC patients.
