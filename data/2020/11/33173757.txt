Purpose:At present, there are no validated biomarkers that can predict whether patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) are likely to benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy. We aimed to determine whether lung immune prognostic index (LIPI) is associated with outcomes in patients with aHCC treated with PD-1 inhibitors.Patients and methods:Patients undergoing initial treatment with PD-1 inhibitors for aHCC at a single center from January 1, 2015 to August 31, 2019 were included. The patients were stratified according to pretreatment LIPI based on a derived neutrophils/(leukocytes minus neutrophils) ratio (dNLR) ≥ 3 and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level ≥ the upper limit of normal (ULN). Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Log rank test were used to calculate and compare survival between good LIPI and intermediate/poor LIPI scores. The prognostic values of LIPI for survival and disease control rate were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models, respectively.Results:Of the 108 study patients, 53 (49%) had a good LIPI (dNLR Conclusion:Pretreatment LIPI combined with a dNLR ≥ 3 and/or LDH ≥ ULN is associated with poor outcomes in patients with aHCC treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Further validation in large, prospective studies are warranted.
