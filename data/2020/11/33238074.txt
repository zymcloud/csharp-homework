Aim:The optimal choice between sorafenib (SOR) or lenvatinib (LEN) as the first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC) remains debatable. Using propensity score matching, this study compares the outcomes of SOR and LEN in the molecular-targeted agent (MTA) sequential treatment of u-HCC patients.Methods:This retrospective, multicenter, observational study recruited 137 u-HCC patients who underwent primary treatment with LEN (n = 52) or SOR (n = 85) between June 2017 and June 2020 after regorafenib was approved as the secondary treatment for u-HCC. Propensity score matching was used to reduce confounding, resulting in the selection of 104 patients (n = 52 for the SOR and LEN cohorts).Results:The median overall survival was 21.8 months for LEN and 20.4 months for SOR. LEN exhibited significantly greater therapeutic efficacy ï»¿as compared to SOR (objective response rate: 3.8% [SOR] vs. 42.3% [LEN], P Conclusions:Both SOR and LEN treatments showed a clinically comparable therapeutic efficacy as the first-line treatments for u-HCC patients in an MTA sequential therapy.
