Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy of the liver and a global health problem. It is often diagnosed at advanced stage where hopeless for effective therapies. Identification of more reliable biomarkers for early detection of HCC is urgently needed. HCC is identified with hyper-vascularity feature. Herein, we sought to develop a novel score based on the combination of the most significant angiogenic biomarkers with and routine laboratory tests for accurate detection of HCC.Material & methods:Angiopoietin II, copper, nitric oxide, albumin, platelets count and α-fetoprotein were assayed in HCC patients (75), liver cirrhosis patients (50) and healthy control (20). Areas under receiving operating curve (AUCs) were calculated and used for construction on novel score. A novel score named HCC-AngioScore = AFP (U/L) Albumin (g/dl) × 5.4 + Angiopoietin (ng/ml) × 0.001 + Copper (mg/dl) × (-0.004) + Platelets count (×109)/L × 0.003 + Nitric oxide (μ mol/L) × 0.27-36 was developed. HCC-AngioScore produce AUC of 0.919for differentiate patients with HCC from those with liver cirrhosis with sensitivity and specificity of a cut-off 0 (i.e., less than 0 the case is considered cirrhotic, whereas above 0 it is considered HCC.Conclusion:HCC-AngioScore could replace AFP during screening of HCV patients and early detection of HCC.
