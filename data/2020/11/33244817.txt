Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an increasing cause of mortality in HIV-infected individuals. We compared host and tumor characteristics between HIV-infected and uninfected Nigerians with HCC and examined the impact of HIV on survival.Methods:This prospective observational study was conducted at Jos University Teaching Hospital in Jos, Nigeria among adults (>18yrs) with HCC enrolled between September 2015 and September 2017 and followed until April 2019. Demographics, tumor characteristics, and survival were compared between HCC subjects with and without HIV.Results:101 subjects (10 HIV-infected and 91 HIV-uninfected) were enrolled [male 72%; median age 48 (IQR 35-60)]. 60% HIV-infected subjects were receiving ART; 90% had CD4 counts â‰¥ 200/mm3 at HCC diagnosis and 20% had HIV RNA levels < 20 copies/mL. 57.4% were infected with chronic HBV (HBsAg+). The duration of symptoms was shorter in HIV-infected vs. uninfected subjects [93 (IQR 54-132) vs. 155 (93-248] days; p=0.02]. At the end of follow-up, 99/101 (98.0%) subjects were confirmed to have died: 9/10 (90.0%) HIV-infected and 90/91 (98.9%) HIV-uninfected. The probability of survival at three months was 22% and 47% in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects, respectively (p=0.02). Median time to death was significantly shorter in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected subjects [24 days (IQR 16-88) vs. 85 days (IQR 34-178), respectively (p=0.03)].Conclusions:High early mortality was observed in this cohort of Nigerian adults with HCC. HIV infection was associated with a faster clinical presentation and shorter survival. More aggressive HCC surveillance may be warranted in HIV-infected subjects, particularly if they are co-infected with chronic HBV.
