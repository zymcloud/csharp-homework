Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high mortality rate, which imposes a huge burden on patients and society. Glypican-1 (GPC1) is considered to be an ideal diagnostic marker. The present study aimed to investigate GPC1 expression in HCC, its association with clinicopathological factors and its prognostic significance in HCC progression. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were used to investigate GPC1 expression in 175 HCC and paired normal tissues, and in HCC and normal cells. Serolo2gical levels of GPC1 were examined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients with HCC. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis were used to assess the prognostic significance of GPC1. The present results suggested that GPC1 expression was upregulated in HCC tissues, especially in metastatic HCC. Similar results were observed in HCC cell lines. Serum GPC1 was higher in patients with HCC than in healthy controls (HCs). Patients with high GPC1 expression had shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) times compared with those with low GPC1 expression. In addition, high GPC1 expression was significantly associated with tumor size and Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage (P
