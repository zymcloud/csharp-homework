Objective:To contribute our results to increase the scientific evidence about the use of radioembolization in the management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Material and methods:This retrospective review included 53 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with radioembolization at our center. Patients were classified according to the BCLC algorithm in detail according to their Child-Pugh functional status. We analyzed survival using the Kaplan-Meier method. We used Cox regression analysis to determine clinically significant parameters, including the doses administered in the parameters studied.Results:Patients ranged in age from 28 to 86 years (mean, 60 years). A total of 61 procedures were done. The mean activity administered was 2.8 GBq (0.7-6.4 GBq), with a mean dose of 229.9Gy (74-425.9Gy) administered in the tumor. Progression-free survival was 6.7 months and overall survival was 12.8 months. Differences in disease-free survival according to BCLC and Child-Pugh classification were not significant (p=0.848 and p=0.252, respectively). The clinical parameters that were significantly different with respect to overall survival were bilirubin levels (pConclusions:Radioembolization is safe and efficacious in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver function and the doses received by the tumor are key parameters for the efficacy of treatment. The increase in the scientific evidence supports the inclusion of this technique in treatment guidelines.
