Objectives:To compare the presence of washout and the diagnostic performance of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the presence of hepatic steatosis.Methods:This retrospective study included 566 patients with chronic liver disease who had undergone hepatic resection for hepatic tumors (482 HCCs and 84 non-HCCs) between January 2016 and June 2018 and had available multiphasic CT and MR images. Patients were allocated in the fatty liver (n = 141) or non-fatty liver (n = 425) group according to the presence of hepatic steatosis, defined as lipid droplets in at least 5% of hepatocytes on pathological examination. The presence of HCC washout and the diagnostic performance of CT and MRI for HCC were compared between the groups.Results:HCC washout was less frequently seen in the fatty liver group than in the non-fatty liver group on CT (61.5% vs. 88.9%, p 0.05).Conclusions:Hepatic steatosis significantly decreased the performance of CT for the diagnosis of HCC, whereas it did not significantly alter the performance of MRI.Key points:• Unlike MRI, there is vanishing HCC washout on CT caused by the background hepatic steatosis. • The diagnostic performance of CT for the diagnosis of HCC was significantly altered by hepatic steatosis. • The optimal cutoff HU value of the liver parenchyma for the vanishing washout of HCC was
