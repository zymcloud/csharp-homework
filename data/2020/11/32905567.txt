It has been a long time since tumor ablation was first tested in patients with liver cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma. Since than it has become a first line treatment modality for hepatocellular carcinoma. Over the years, the indications of thermal ablation have expanded to colorectal cancer liver metastases and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma as well. Together with the new indication for ablation, new ablation devices have been developed as well. Among them microwave ablation shows potential in replacing radiofrequency ablation as the preferred method of thermal ablation in liver cancer. The debate whether radiofrequency or microwave ablation should be the preferred method of treatment in patients with liver cancer remains open. The main purpose of this review is to offer some answers to the question: Microwave ablation in liver tumors: a better tool or simply more power? Various clinical scenarios will be analyzed including small, medium, and intermediate size hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer liver metastases and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Furthermore, the advantages, limitations, and technical considerations of MWA treatment will be provided also.
