Epigenetic mechanisms, such as acetylation, methylation, and succinylation, play pivotal roles in the regulation of multiple normal biological processes, including neuron regulation, hematopoiesis, bone cell maturation, and metabolism. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms are closely associated with the pathological processes of various diseases, such as metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancers. Epigenetic changes may precede genetic mutation, so research on epigenetic changes and regulation may be important for the early detection and diagnosis of disease. Histone deacetylase11 (HDAC11) is the newest member of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family and the only class IV histone deacetylase. HDAC11 has different expression levels and biological functions in different systems of the human body and is among the top 1 to 4% of genes overexpressed in cancers, such as breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal pelvis urothelial carcinoma. This article analyzes the role and mechanism of HDAC11 in disease, especially in tumorigenesis, in an attempt to provide new ideas for clinical and basic research.
