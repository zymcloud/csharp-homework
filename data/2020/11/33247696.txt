Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health concern in many countries including Egypt. The alteration in DNA methylation that was observed in HCC patients suggests a possible role of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the disease pathogenesis in addition to potential role as a disease biomarker.Aim:To study the change in DNMTs expression in chronic HCV infected patients as potential non- invasive biomarker for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:26 patients with HCC, 45 patients with liver cirrhosis, 20 chronic HCV patients and 20 apparently healthy individuals as a control group were enrolled in this study. Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for all study participants.Results:A significant difference in DNMTs expression was observed among the studied groups. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis revealed that with a cutoff value of 3.16 for DNMT 3A expression, sensitivity and specificity were 80.8 and 95.6% respectively and area under curve (AUC) was 0.958, p 0.05).Conclusion:The mRNA levels of DNMTs could be a potential biomarker for early detection of HCC development..
