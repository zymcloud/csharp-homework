Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a type of highly aggressive pediatric tumor in bones and soft tissues and its metastatic spread remains the most powerful predictor of poor outcome. We previously identified that the transcription factor hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) promotes ES tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying ES metastasis remain unclear. Here, we show that HDGF drives ES metastasis in vitro and in vivo, and HDGF reduces metastasis-free survival (MFS) in two independent large cohorts of human ES patients. Integrative analyses of HDGF ChIP-seq and gene expression profiling in ES cells reveal that HDGF regulates multiple metastasis-associated genes, among which activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) emerges as a major HDGF target and a novel metastasis-suppressor in ES. HDGF down-regulates ALCAM, induces expression and activation of the downstream effectors Rho-GTPase Rac1 and Cdc42, and promotes actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell-matrix adhesion. In addition, repression of ALCAM and activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 are required for the pro-metastatic functions of HDGF in vitro. Moreover, analyses in murine models with ES tumor orthotopic implantation and experimental metastasis, as well as in human ES samples, demonstrate the associations among HDGF, ALCAM, and GTPases expression levels. Furthermore, high HDGF/low ALCAM expression define a subgroup of patients harboring the worst MFS. These findings suggest that the HDGF/ALCAM/GTPases axis represents a promising therapeutic target for limiting ES metastasis.
