Long non-coding RNA (lnc) HCG18 has been reported to contribute progression of a variety of tumours. However, its roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In the current study, we intended to uncover the biological functions of HCG18 in HCC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to detect the expression of HCG18, microRNA-214-3p (miR-214-3p) and centromere protein M (CENPM) messenger RNA (mRNA). The role of HCG18 in the growth and migration were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay and flow cytometry in vitro and animal experiments in vivo. The results showed that HCG18 was highly expressed in HCC tissues. HCG18 silencing inhibited the proliferation and migration while induced the apoptosis of HCC cells. Besides, miR-214-3p was down-regulated in HCC cells. Further experiments revealed that miR-214-3p could directly bind to HCG18 and exerted an anti-tumour role to counteracted siHCG18-1-mediated influence in HCC cells. Moreover, miR-214-3p could directly interact with CENPM mRNA and down-regulating the expression of CENPM. While HCG18 could up-regulate the expression of CENPM through acting as a sponge of miR-214-3p. Therefore, those results suggested HCG18 functioned as an oncogene to promote the proliferation and migration of HCC cells via miR-214-3p/CENPM axis.
