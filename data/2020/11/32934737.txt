Renal cell cancer is a common malignant tumor of the urinary system. Ursolic acid (UA) serves an important antitumor role in certain types of cancer, such as lung cancer, breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of UA on renal cancer has not yet been investigated. In the present study, A498 cells were treated with different concentrations of UA for 12, 24 and 48 h, and then MCC950, an inhibitor of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) receptor, was added to block NLRP3 signaling. The proliferation of A498 cells was analyzed using an MTS assay and invasiveness was analyzed using a Transwell assay. The expression levels of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, IL-1Î² and MMP-2 were detected using western blotting. The present results demonstrated that the invasiveness of A498 cells was significantly decreased following UA treatment (P
