A 77-year-old man was treated with a DPP-4 inhibitor for type 2 diabetes. Hypoglycemia occurred frequently, and an examination revealed a tumor with a maximum diameter of 140 mm in both lobes of the liver. Western immunoblotting detected a high-molecular-weight form of insulin-like growth factor-II, and non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia was diagnosed. Although prednisolone 40 mg was started, hypoglycemia continued to occur frequently. Surgical tumor removal was not indicated, so lenvatinib was initiated. Hypoglycemia improved quickly, and the tumor shrank until it had partially disappeared. His condition continued to improve, and he was discharged.
