Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have many treatment options. For patients with surgical indication, consideration of future liver remnant and the surgical complexity of the procedure is essential. A new 3-level complexity classification categorizing 11 liver resection procedures predicts surgical complexity and postoperative morbidity better than reported classifications. Preoperative portal vein embolization can mitigate the risk of hepatic insufficiency. For small HCCs, both liver resection and ablation are effective. New medical treatment options are promising and perioperative use of these drugs may further improve outcomes for patients undergoing liver resection and lead to changes in current treatment guidelines.
