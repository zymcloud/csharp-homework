Aim:Repeated transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) eventually leads to either deteriorated hepatic reserve or TACE refractoriness. Switching to molecular targeted agents after TACE requires preservation of hepatic reserve. This study aimed to investigate the predictive factors associated with early deterioration of hepatic reserve by repeated TACE prior to refractoriness.Methods:Ninety-three patients with intermediate-stage HCC who underwent TACE as the first-line treatment and had a Child-Pugh class A hepatic reserve were retrospectively analyzed. The time to Child-Pugh class deterioration (TTCPD), defined as the duration from initial TACE to the diagnosis of Child-Pugh class B or C prior to TACE refractoriness, was assessed. Patients who progressed to TACE refractoriness prior to Child-Pugh class deterioration were censored at TACE refractoriness.Results:The radiological response to initial TACE was assessed as responders and non-responders in 59 (63.4%) and 34 (36.6%) patients, respectively. The median TTCPD was 40.6 months in all patients. The hepatic reserve in 31 (33.3%) patients deteriorated to Child-Pugh class B or C prior to TACE refractoriness. In the multivariate analysis, non-response to initial TACE, albumin-bilirubin grade 2, and non-selective TACE were identified as independent predictors associated with a shortened TTCPD. The TTCPD was significantly shorter in the non-responders than in the responders to initial TACE (median, 19.6 vs. 55.9 months; P Conclusions:Failure to respond to initial TACE was a predictive factor for early deterioration of hepatic reserve prior to TACE refractoriness in intermediate-stage HCC patients with repeated TACE.
