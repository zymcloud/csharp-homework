Purpose:The surgical margin for liver resection to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is occasionally Methods:The data of 454 patients undergoing curative liver resection for solitary HCC in our institution were analyzed. The patients were divided into the MR (n = 90) and non-MR (n = 364) groups. The clinicopathological data and outcomes after liver resection were compared. A case-matching analysis using a propensity scoring method was also performed.Results:The recurrence-free survival was significantly and overall survival was marginally significantly lower in the MR group than in the non-MR group (p = 0.012-0.051, respectively). According to a multivariate analysis, MR was not a significant independent factor for recurrence-free survival (p = 0.056). After propensity score matching, there were no significant differences in the recurrence-free and overall survival between the two groups (p = 0.375-0.496, respectively). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the intrahepatic recurrence patterns between the two groups before and after matching.Conclusion:MR for solitary HCC might be sufficient in patients with a limited liver functional reserve.
