Backgrounds/aims:Surgical resection for the treatment of multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) is controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and oncological outcomes after liver resection in patients with multiple HCCs.Methods:Clinicopathological and survival data of 187 patients who underwent curative resection for multiple HCCs between June 2004 and December 2016 at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea were retrospectively reviewed. The prognostic factors for recurrence and survival were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:Of the 187 patients, 153 (81.8%) had two nodules, 23 (12.3%) had three nodules, and 11 (5.9%) had more than three nodules. Multiple tumors were located in the ipsilateral lobe in 163 (87.2%) patients. Anatomical resection, non-anatomical resection, and both types of resections were performed in 81.3%, 8.0%, and 10.7% patients, respectively. Recurrence occurred in 133 (71.1%) patients, and the mean time to recurrence after surgery was 34.2 months. Independent risk factors for tumor recurrence in multivariate analyses were indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min ≥15%, preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level ≥400 ng/ml, and total tumor diameter ≥6 cm. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year disease-free survival rates were 94.1%, 81.7%, 69.7%, and 39.4%, respectively, and the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 93.5%, 74.2%, 64.9%, and 38.8%, respectively.Conclusions:Our experience shows that liver resection can be considered a first-line treatment option for selected patients with multiple HCCs who have well-preserved liver function.
