A polysaccharide (ESPS) purified from Eupolyphaga sinensis Walker by ion exchange chromatography and gel chromatography was investigated, including its structure characterization and antitumor activity. The results showed that ESPS was composed of rhamnose, fucose, arabinose, xylose, glucose, and galactose in a molar ratio of 7.4: 3.1: 13.9: 9.3: 39.7: 26.5, with the mean weight (Mw) of 2.14 × 104Da; the main chain of ESPS was mainly composed of → 4) - α - D - Glcp - (1 → and → 3) - β - D - Galp - (1 →, and the side chains were connected to the main chain through the O-6 atom of glucose and O-4 and O-6 atom of galactose. In addition, ESPS promoted the lymphocyte proliferation and inhibited liver cancer cells growth through enhancing lymphocyte activity in vitro, mainly NK cells. Moreover, ESPS markedly stimulated immunity in H22-bearing mice by increasing the spleen and thymus indices and effectively inhibited H22 cell growth in vivo. These data indicated that ESPS was a polysaccharide component possessing high anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity, representing a potential immunotherapy candidate for the treatment of liver cancer.
