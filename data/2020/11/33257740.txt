Due to the lack of early diagnostic and effective treatment modalities, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still the most lethal cancer with a high mortality on a global scale. Recent studies have highlighted the key roles of microRNAs (miRs) in HCC development. In the study, we attempted to investigate the potential role of miR-9-5p in the progression of HCC. Expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) and miR-9-5p was examined in HCC tissues collected from HCC patients and cell lines. The proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of HCC cells, and levels of oxygen consumption rate, extracellular acidification rate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the tumorigenicity of transfected cells in vivo were measured after gain- and loss-of-function experiments in HCC cells. It was revealed that miR-9-5p was upregulated, while PDK4 was poorly expressed in HCC tissues and cells, associating with a poor prognosis of HCC patients. miR-9-5p directly targeted PDK4 and could downregulate its expression, thus leading to promoted cell proliferation, invasion and migration, enhanced mitochondrial activity and energy metabolism, and suppressed apoptosis in HCC cells, along with increased tumorigenicity in mouse xenograft models. Altogether, miR-9-5p facilitated mitochondrial energy metabolism of HCC cells by downregulating PDK4, promoting the development of HCC. miR-9-5p and PDK4 may serve as potential therapeutic targets for preventing recurrence and metastasis of HCC.
