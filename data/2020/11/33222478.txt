Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is an extremely rare vascular neoplasm of the liver with an unpredictable clinical course and prognosis. It is commonly misdiagnosed with other liver lesions such as angiosarcomas, cholangiocarcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas or metastases. We present a case of a 58-years-old woman with a solitary hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma treated with laparoscopic liver resection. Due to its low incidence, standardized clinical protocols are not yet established. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiofrecuency or microwave ablation, liver resection or transplantation.
