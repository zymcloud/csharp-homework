Purpose:Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare disease with few therapeutic options. There is an urgency of new effective therapeutic options for these patients. The role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in advanced ACC patients is still unclear.Methods:We conducted a MEDLINE search using the following string: adrenocortical carcinoma and immunotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors.Results:We found four case series comprising 10 patients, and four prospective studies totaling 115 patients. The response rate (RR) in the group of 10 patients was 1 complete response, 3 partial response (PR), 4 stable disease (SD), and 2 progressive disease (PD). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) ranged from 2 to 31 months and the median overall survival (mOS) ranged from 4.3 to 31 months. The results in the 115 patients from prospective trials was variable, the PR ranged from 6 to 23%, the SD ranged from 18 to 50% and overall disease control rate ranged from 30 to 64%. The mPFS reported varied from 1.8 to 2.6 months while the mOS varied from 10.6 to 24.9 months. There were five patients with sustained response for more than 24 months. The most common treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was the increase in liver enzymes. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Better results in terms of RR and survival were observed in studies that used pembrolizumab. No predictive biomarker of response was found up to now.Conclusion:ICI, mainly pembrolizumab, is a potential therapeutic option, which is safe and associated with prolonged OS benefit, in selected patients with advanced ACC.
