Background:Yangyin Fuzheng Jiedu Prescription (YFJP) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) indicated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its potential targets and molecular mechanisms are not clear. Therefore, this study intends to explore the molecular mechanism of YFJP based on network pharmacology analysis and in vitro validation.Methods and results:Through univariate and multivariate analyses and survival analysis in HCC patients with or without YFJP treatment we found that drinking alcohol, alfafeto protein ≥ 400 ng/l, baseline portal vein tumor thrombus and total bilirubin level ≥ 18.8 μM) were independent risk factors for poor prognosis, while red blood cell count ≥ 4 × 109/l and TCM treatment were independent protective factors. Besides, YFJP prolonged the cumulative survival of HCC patients. Using online pharmacological methods, we obtained 58 relevant compounds and molecular 53 targets. By using scratch test, Transwell assay, EdU assay, and TUNEL staining, we found that YFJP-containing serum repressed the migration, invasion and proliferation of HCC cells in vitro, and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, YFJP diminished the gene expression of TP53, CCND1, p-EGFR, EGF, VEGFA, JUN, IL6, COX-2, AKT1, and MAPK1 in HCC cells, but elevated the expression of ESR1 and CASP3.Conclusions:Taken together, results showed that YFJP attenuated HCC progression through mediating effects on HCC-related genes.
