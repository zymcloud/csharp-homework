Background:An increasing number of studies have focused on the association between leptin, adiponectin levels and the risk as well as the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the reported results are conflicting.Methods:A meta-analysis was performed to assess the correlation between leptin, adiponectin levels and risk and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (CRD42020195882). Through June 14, 2020, PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMBASE databases were searched, including references of qualifying articles. Titles, abstracts, and main texts were reviewed by at least 2 independent readers. Stata 16.0 was used to calculate statistical data.Results:Thirty studies were included in this meta-analysis and results showed that hepatocellular carcinoma group had significantly higher leptin levels than the cancer-free control group (SMD = 1.83, 95% CI (1.09, 2.58), P = 0.000), the healthy control group (SMD = 4.32, 95% CI (2.41, 6.24), P = 0.000) and the cirrhosis group (SMD = 1.85, 95% CI (0.70, 3.01), P = 0.002). Hepatocellular carcinoma group had significantly higher adiponectin levels than the healthy control group (SMD = 1.57, 95% CI (0.37, 2.76), P = 0.010), but no statistical difference compared with the cancer-free control group (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI (- 0.35, 0.82), P = 0.430) and the cirrhosis group (SMD = - 0.51, 95% CI (- 1.30, 0.29), P = 0.213). The leptin rs7799039 polymorphism was associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (G vs A: OR = 1.28, 95% CI (1.10, 1.48), P = 0.002). There were linear relationships between adiponectin levels and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 1.066, 95% CI (1.03, 1.11), P = 0.001). In addition, the results showed that high/positive expression of adiponectin was significantly related to lower overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HR = 1.70, 95% CI (1.22, 2.37), P = 0.002); however, there was no significantly association between the leptin levels and overall survival (HR = 0.92, 95% CI (0.53, 1.59), P = 0.766).Conclusion:The study shows that high leptin levels were associated with a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Adiponectin levels were proportional to hepatocellular carcinoma risk, and were related to the poor prognosis.
