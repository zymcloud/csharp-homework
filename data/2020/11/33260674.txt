Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by the dysfunction of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Alterations in the level of PAH leads to the toxic accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and brain. Protein degradation mediated by ubiquitination is a principal cellular process for maintaining protein homeostasis. Therefore, it is important to identify the E3 ligases responsible for PAH turnover and proteostasis. Here, we report that anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-Cdh1 (APC/C)Cdh1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that interacts and promotes the polyubiquitination of PAH through the 26S proteasomal pathway. Cdh1 destabilizes and declines the half-life of PAH. In contrast, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Cdh1 stabilizes PAH expression and enhances phenylalanine metabolism. Additionally, our current study demonstrates the clinical relevance of PAH and Cdh1 correlation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overall, we show that PAH is a prognostic marker for HCC and Cdh1 could be a potential therapeutic target to regulate PAH-mediated physiological and metabolic disorders.
