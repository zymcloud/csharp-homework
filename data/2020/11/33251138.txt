Objective:This study aimed to build and evaluate a radiomics feature-based model for the preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A total of 145 patients were retrospectively included in the study pool, and the patients were divided randomly into two independent cohorts with a ratio of 7:3 (training cohort: n = 101, validation cohort: n = 44). For a pilot study of this predictive model another 18 patients were recruited into this study. A total of 1,231 computed tomography (CT) image features of the liver parenchyma without tumors were extracted from portal-phase CT images. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was applied to build a radiomics score (Rad-score) model. Afterwards, a nomogram, including Rad-score as well as other clinicopathological risk factors, was established with a multivariate logistic regression model. The discrimination efficacy, calibration efficacy, and clinical utility value of the nomogram were evaluated.Results:The Rad-score scoring model could predict MVI with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.637 (95% CI, 0.516-0.758) in the training cohort as well as of 0.583 (95% CI, 0.395-0.770) in the validation cohort; however, the aforementioned discriminative approach could not completely outperform those existing predictors (alpha fetoprotein, neutrophilic granulocyte, and preoperative hemoglobin). The individual predictive nomogram which included the Rad-score, alpha fetoprotein, neutrophilic granulocyte, and preoperative hemoglobin showed a better discrimination efficacy with AUC of 0.865 (95% CI, 0.786-0.944), which was higher than the conventional methods' AUCs (nomogram vs Rad-score, alpha fetoprotein, neutrophilic granulocyte, and preoperative hemoglobin at P Conclusions:The radiomics feature-based predictive model improved the preoperative prediction of MVI in HCC patients significantly. It could be a potentially valuable clinical utility.
