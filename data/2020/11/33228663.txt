Background:Long non-coding RNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been reported to play an essential role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the role of NEAT1 in regulation of alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) remains largely unknown. This study aims to explore the role of NEAT1 in ASH by mediating microRNA-129-5p (miR-129-5p) targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2).Methods:NEAT1, miR-129-5p and SOCS2 expression in serum of ASH patients were assessed. In the in vitro cellular experiment, we transfected siRNAs, oligonucleotides or plasmids into ethanol-induced AML-12 mouse hepatocytes to alter NEAT1 and miR-129-5p expression, and inflammatory factors and lipid content were determined. In the in vivo animal experiment, we injected lentiviruses carrying siRNAs, oligonucleotides or plasmids onto ASH mice (ASH induced by feeding mice a Lieber-DeCarli ethanol diet) to alter NEAT1 and miR-129-5p expression through the tail vein. Serum liver function, blood lipids and inflammatory factors were detected; liver histopathology, liver cell apoptosis, and fibrosis were observed. The relationship between NEAT1 and miR-129-5p, or between miR-129-5p and SOCS2 was verified.Results:MiR-129-5p was reduced while NEAT1 and SOCS2 were elevated in ASH. Inhibited NEAT1 or elevated miR-129-5p suppressed the elevated lipid metabolism and restrained inflammation reaction in ethanol-stimulated AML-12 cells. The promoted miR-129-5p and inhibited NEAT1 could improve the liver function and repress blood lipid, inflammation reaction, hepatocyte apoptosis and liver fibrosis in ethanol-induced ASH mice. Furthermore, NEAT1 could negatively regulate miR-129-5p to target SOCS2.Conclusion:We have found that the inhibited NEAT1 could suppress liver fibrosis in ASH mice by promoting miR-129-5p and restraining SOCS2, thereby decelerating the development of ASH.
