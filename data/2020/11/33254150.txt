Supramolecular encapsulation removes harmful substances from organisms has evolved into a new strategy. In this article, we prepared three supramolecular complexes of acyclic cucurbit[n]urils (ACBs) with uric acid (UA), and studied the inclusion behaviors of ACBs and UA by fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Furthermore, we characterized the effect of the complexes of UA with ACBs on the expression of inflammatory biomarkers in human hepatoma HepG2 cell lines through C-reactive protein (CRP) western blot. The results showed UA molecules can be recognized by three ACBs with different binding constants, and ACBs successfully blocked the inflammatory stimulation of uric acid on HepG2 cell lines and inhibited the expression of the major inflammatory factor CRP by formations of complexes between UA and ACBs. This article proves that ACBs can efficiently reversing cytotoxicity of UA, which provides a new method to treating hyperuricemia disease.
