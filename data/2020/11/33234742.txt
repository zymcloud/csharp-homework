Backgrounds/aims:The role of immunonutrition (IMN) after liver resections or hepatectomies remains unclear and controversial. We undertook a systematic review to evaluate the effects of IMN on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing hepatectomy.Methods:Main electronic databases were searched for randomised trials reported clinical outcomes or effects of IMN. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guideline and meta-analysis was analysed using fixed or random-effects models.Results:Eleven RCTs were identified. A total of 1084 patients (529 IMN and 555 Control) were included in the final pooled analysis. Of these patients, 43% (440/1016) underwent major hepatectomies and the majority are for hepatocellular carcinoma (90%, 956/1055) with Child-Pugh A disease (89%, 793/894). IMN significantly reduced post-operative wound infection (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.96; p=0.03). IMN also had a shorter hospital stay (MD -4.97 days, 95% CI -8.23 to -1.72; p=0.003). There was no statistically significant in other post-operative morbidities and mortality.Conclusions:Wound infection rate was not significantly different between oral and parenteral IMN group. The length of hospital stay was significantly lower in parenteral IMN group than in oral IMN group. The mortality rates were not affected. Immunonutrition should be recommended routinely as part of the nutritional support in the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) protocol for hepatectomy.
