Liposomal drug-delivery systems (LDDs) provide a promising opportunity to precisely target organs, improve drug bioavailability and reduce systemic toxicity. On the other hand, PI3K/Akt signaling pathways control various intracellular functions including apoptosis, invasion and cell growth. Hyper activation of PI3K and Akt is detected in some types of cancer that posses defect in PTEN. Tracking the crosstalk between PI3K/Akt, PTEN and STAT 5A signaling pathways, in cancer could result in identifying new therapeutic agents. The current study, identified an over view on PI3K/Akt, PTEN and STAT-5A networks, in addition to their biological roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the current study galactomannan was extracted from Caesalpinia gilliesii seeds then loaded in liposomes. Liposomes were prepared employing phosphatidyl choline and different concentrations of cholesterol. HCC was then induced in Wistar albino rats followed by liposomal galactomannan (700 ± 100 nm) treatment. Liver enzymes as well as antioxidants were assessed and PI3K/Akt, PTEN and STAT-5A gene expression were investigated. The prepared vesicles revealed entrapment efficiencies ranging from 23.55 to 69.17%, and negative zeta potential values. The optimum formulation revealed spherical morphology as well as diffusion controlled in vitro release pattern. Liposomal galactomannan elucidated a significant reduction in liver enzymes and MDA as well as PI3K/Akt, PTEN and STAT 5A gene expression. A significant elevation in GST and GSH were deduced. In conclusion, Liposomal galactomannan revealed a promising candidate for HCC therapy.
