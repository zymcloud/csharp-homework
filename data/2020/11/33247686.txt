Objective:hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a dreadful complication of liver cirrhosis. Aim was to study the effect of sarcopenia on the survival in patients with HCC.Methods:we included 262 patients and were followed up for 12 months. Sarcopenia was calculated by skeletal muscle index (SMI). Sarcopenia was defined by SMI ≤39 cm2/m2 for women and ≤50 cm2/m2 for men.Results:patients with sarcopenia (n= 113, 43.1%) were older, mainly males, Child-Pugh class B and smokers. Patients with sarcopenia had lower survival than those without (10.09 vs. 11.72 months). Survival was also lower in Barcelona clinic liver cancer stage C than B and A (9.02 vs. 11.21 vs. 11.89 months). Age and sarcopenia were hazardous of mortality (p Conclusion:Sarcopenia is associated with lack of response to therapy, liver decompensation and higher mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma patients..
