Background and aims:Long-term antiviral therapy can effectively suppress viral replication and improve clinical outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but it cannot eliminate risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the association of metabolic risk factors with the risks of cancer and all-cause mortality in CHB patients.Approach and results:This nationwide population-based study from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database consisted of adults with CHB who underwent health examinations from 2007 through 2012. We collected baseline data on metabolic risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. The risks of developing HCC, non-HCC cancer, and overall death were analyzed according to the metabolic risk profile. The study population comprised of 317,856 patients (median age, 46 years [interquartile range, 37-54 years]; 219,418 men [69.0%]) had 2,609,523.8 person-years of follow-up. A total of 18,850 HCCs, 22,164 non-HCC cancers, and 15,768 deaths were observed during a median follow-up period of 8.5 years. The metabolic risk factor burden was positively associated with the risks of HCC, non-HCC cancer, and all-cause mortality (all PConclusion:The metabolic risk factor burden was associated with increased risks of HCC, non-HCC cancer, and all-cause mortality in patients with CHB.
