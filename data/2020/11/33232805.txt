Objective:Inflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms may influence the hepatic and extrahepatic HBV-related disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between polymorphisms of IL-17, IL-21 gene and HBV related hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese Han population.Methods:We performed a multi-center study comprised 866 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and 1086 unrelated patients with a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) as control to evaluate the effects of IL-17 (rs4711998), IL-21 SNPs (rs12508721, rs13143866 and rs2221903) and the susceptibility of HCC. MassARRAY technology was utilized to genotype. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the serum IL-17 and IL-21 level. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the serum viral loads.Results:In logistic regression analysis, our results showed the frequency of rs4711998 allele G in CHB group was significantly higher than that in HCC group (P = 0.042, 0.859(0.743-0.994)), and it is present only among females. Compared to HCC group, rs13143866 A allele was more likely to appear in HCC group (P = 0.015, 1.268 (1.049-1.532)). The frequency of AA also showed different between HCC group and CHB groups (P = 0.011, 3.135 (1.292-7.603)), which showed strong sex-specific relationships. ELISA showed a higher serum IL-17 and IL-21 expression in HCC patients compared to CHB patients (P all 0.05).Conclusion:We suggested rs4711998 allele A as risk factors for women to develop HBV related-HCC in Chinese Han population. rs13143866 allele A as risk factors to develop HBV related-HCC in Chinese male population. Male patients with haplotype rs12508721C/rs13143866A/rs2221903T may with 1.3-fold risk for HBV-related HCC.
