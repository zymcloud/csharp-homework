Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand can induce cell apoptosis in various tumor cells. However, many cancer cells are resistant to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand. Therefore, overcoming the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand resistance makes it possible for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand-based anti-cancer therapies. In this study, we took mesenchymal epithelial transition factor as the research target to study its role in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma. Mesenchymal epithelial transition factor gene has been proved to be an effective predictor of recurrence after hepatocellular carcinoma resection. The expression of mesenchymal epithelial transition factor and cyclin B1 were measured in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand-resistant and non-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Cyclin B1-knockdown and cyclin B1-overexpression hepatocellular carcinoma cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand; mesenchymal epithelial transition factor knockout, mesenchymal epithelial transition factor re-introduction and cyclin B1 restored in hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand were established. And MTT, bromodeoxyuridine, flow cytometry and western blotting were performed to evaluate the effect of mesenchymal epithelial transition factor and cyclin B1 on hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand. In addition, subcutaneous tumor transplantation in nude mice was conducted to access the effect of mesenchymal epithelial transition factor and cyclin B1 on tumor formation in vivo. In conclusion, cyclin B1 enhanced the cell growth and inhibited apoptosis in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells. And mesenchymal epithelial transition factor promoted the cell growth and apoptosis in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells by regulating cyclin B1. Therefore, mesenchymal epithelial transition factor regulates the cyclin B1 to regulate tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our results suggest a novel molecular mechanism for regulating tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand resistance, which might be helpful to select drug targets in the treatment of liver cancer.
