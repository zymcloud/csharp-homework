Haemophilia is an X-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by coagulation factor deficiency. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major complication associated with the disease. No study thus far has investigated the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for HCC in patients with haemophilia.Aim:This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RFA for HCC in haemophilia patients.Methods:From July 2008 to June 2019, 217 patients with HCC underwent 300 RFA sessions. Of these, 18 sessions were performed in ten haemophilia patients (H group) and 282 in 207 non-haemophilia patients (NH group). The patients' characteristics, incidence of haemorrhagic complications and rates of local tumour recurrence were compared between the groups.Results:A majority of the haemophilia patients received clotting factor concentrate replacement therapy before and after RFA treatment, with the aim of reaching a plasma clotting factor level of higher than 60%-80%. Twelve haemorrhagic complications were observed in the NH group (4.2%; 12/282). Major bleeding requiring control procedures was observed in two patients and minor bleeding with careful observation was noted in ten patients. No bleeding complications were observed in the H group (0/18). There were no significant differences in the 5-year local tumour recurrence rates after RFA treatment between the groups (35.0% in the H group and 32.1% in the NH group).Conclusion:RFA could be an effective and a safe method for HCC treatment in patients with haemophilia.
