Background:Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are thought to be involved in the development of various malignancies. The expression and function of hsa_circ_0006916, a newly identified circRNA, in hepatocellular carcinoma remain unclear.Methods:Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect hsa_circ_0006916 in hepatocellular carcinoma. In vitro function assays were conducted to explore growth and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Next, the mechanism of hsa_circ_0006916 function in hepatocellular carcinoma was determined by luciferase reporter and RIP assays.Results:Hsa_circ_0006916 was substantially overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and cells. High levels of hsa_circ_0006916 in hepatocellular carcinoma patients were associated with advanced clinical characteristics. Down-regulation of hsa_circ_0006916 decreased the growth and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro. The results suggested that hsa_circ_0006916 acted as a sponge of miR-337-3p and had an important functional use in the regulation of STAT3 levels in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, miR-337-3p inhibition or STAT3 overexpression abolished the effect of hsa_circ_0006916 suppression on the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Conclusions:Our data suggest a novel hsa_circ_0006916/miR-337-3p/STAT3 axis in hepatocellular carcinoma, and provide a new target for treatment.
