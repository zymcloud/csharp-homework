Background:Portal vein embolization (PVE) is widely used to promote the hypertrophy of a future liver remnant (FLR) and reduce posthepatectomy liver failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of transileocecal portal embolization (TIPE) associated with staging laparoscopy (hybrid lap-TIPE) for a planned hepatectomy in advanced hepatobiliary cancers.Methods:The hybrid lap-TIPE procedure consisted of staging laparoscopy for complete screening of the abdominal cavity with cytoreductive surgery and subsequent TIPE. Data on hybrid lap-TIPE, performed between March 2013 and February 2020, were collected retrospectively.Results:Hybrid lap-TIPE was conducted for 52 patients, and a subsequent TIPE was accomplished in 42 patients (80.8%), since staging laparoscopy detected latent or unresectable factors in 13 patients (25.0%), among which 2 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 1 with colorectal liver metastasis received laparoscopic cytoreductive surgery for latent lesions in the FLR. Finally, radical hepatectomy was completed in 36 patients (69.2%), including 3 patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery. The most common operation was an extended right hepatectomy (50.0%), followed by right hepatectomy (30.6%), including 3 hepatopancreatoduodenectomies. The overall morbidity associated with hybrid lap-TIPE and hepatectomy was 7.1% and 41.7%, respectively. The mortality associated with hybrid lap-TIPE and hepatectomy was 0% and 5.6%, respectively. The rates of 2-year survival and 2-year disease-free survival were 64.8% and 61.9%, respectively, after hepatectomy.Conclusions:Hybrid lap-TIPE is safe and could be a useful treatment option for patients with advanced hepatobiliary cancer because it can help to identify optimal candidates for PVE followed by a planned hepatectomy.
