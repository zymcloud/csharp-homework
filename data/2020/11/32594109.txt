Background:Protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) is produced by the liver during hepatoma and upon warfarin administration. Those patients have disturbed protein synthesis and glycosylation in the liver. This decreases the number of γ-carboxyglutamyl (Gla) residues on prothrombin, converting prothrombin into PIVKA-II. The mechanism of this conversion, however, is not clearly understood.Methods:Prothrombin was isolated from healthy and warfarin-treated individuals whose liver function of protein production was quantitatively normal. Glycan structures in the purified prothrombin containing PIVKA-II were qualitatively analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography after labeling the glycan with fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide.Results:The concentration of PIVKA-II was significantly higher in the warfarin-treated individuals than in the healthy individuals (P< 0.001). Although protein production in the liver was normal in both groups, the concentration of prothrombin was lower in the warfarin-treated individuals than in the healthy individuals (P < 0.001). The main glycan was A2 in the healthy and warfarin-treated individuals (86.6 ± 4.4% and 85.6 ± 3.4%, respectively). Eight types of glycan were characterized in both groups, although generation of PIVKA-II in the warfarin-treated individuals did not lead to variation in glycosylation of prothrombin.Conclusions:Warfarin therapy leads to lower amounts of prothrombin and Gla residues within prothrombin without exerting qualitative and quantitative change in glycan profile and protein synthetic function in the liver.
