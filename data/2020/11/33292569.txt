Background:Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease. It is associated with the loss of function of the p53 protein and an increased risk of malignant tumor development at early age. The most frequently detected tumors include breast cancer, sarcomas, leukemia, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinomas. While sarcomas account for only 1% of solid tumors, they are more frequently detected in these families.Case presentation:We report a simultaneous diagnosis of hepatic perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa), a very rare subtype of sarcoma, in two siblings with a LFS.Conclusions:The simultaneous diagnosis of PEComa in two siblings presented in this case allowed us to review the frequency of PEComa in this genetic syndrome previously reported, which was very little. Despite its rarity, PEComa must be considered in the differential diagnosis of new-onset liver lesions in patients who were previously diagnosed with LFS.
