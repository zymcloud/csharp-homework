Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. At present, drug options for systemic treatment of HCC are very limited. There is an urgent need to develop additional effective drugs for HCC treatment. In the present study, we found that proscillaridin A (ProA), a cardiac glycoside, exerted a strong anticancer effect on multiple HCC cell lines. ProA significantly inhibited the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. ProA also had a marked inhibitory effect on the progression of HCC in the MHCC97H xenograft nude mouse model. ProA-mediated suppression of HCC was closely related to cell apoptosis. ProA-treated HCC cells displayed significant mitochondrial damage and elevated reactive oxygen species production, resulting in profound cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, ProA also played a role in autophagy induction in HCC cells. Defects in autophagy partially relieved ProA's anticancer effect in HCC cells. Our findings demonstrate that ProA can effectively inhibit HCC progression and may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for HCC treatment.
