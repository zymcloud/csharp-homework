Covalently closed circular RNAs (circRNAs) display dysregulated expression in several types of cancer. However, their functions remain largely unclear. In this work, datasets GSE125469 and GSE128274 of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were selected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HCC and adjacent tissues, we used R package DESeq for analysis. Then, 15 DEcircRNAs, 65 DEmiRNAs, and 2084 DEmRNAs were identified comparing HCC and normal tissues. Next, to predict the target relationship of circRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA in DEGs, we use the databases CircInteractome and starBase v2.0 for analysis. Finally, the ceRNA network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA was established by Cytoscape software based on 2 DEcircRNAs (hsa_circ_0007813 and hsa_circ_0089372), 2 DEmiRNAs, and 98 DEmRNAs. In addition, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of DEGs to explore the function of DEGs in HCC. Functional enrichment analyses indicated DEmRNAs might be associated with HCC occurrence and progression. In general, our research reveals an important role of ceRNA's molecular mechanism in HCC.
