Albumin messenger RNA (mRNA) in situ hybridization is a sensitive and specific biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) shows variable sensitivity, whereas extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) and metastatic carcinoma are generally negative. We studied the clinical utility and limitations of albumin mRNA detection in a cohort of HCCs, ICCs, ECCs, bile duct adenomas, bile duct hamartomas, and metastatic carcinomas to the liver; and investigated the variability in sensitivity observed for this biomarker in ICCs. We identified 122 cases of hepatobiliary lesions and metastatic carcinomas. Albumin mRNA detection was performed using RNAscope run on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. ICCs were categorized according to the classification proposed by Hayashi and colleagues into the small duct, large duct, and indeterminate subtypes. Albumin mRNA was detected in all 17 HCCs and focally in 6/8 (75%) of bile duct adenomas. All 28 nonhepatic carcinomas, 13 bile duct hamartomas, and 9 ECCs were negative. Albumin mRNA was found in 38/47 (80.9%) of ICC with 35/37 (94.6%) in the small duct subtype, 2/3 (66.7%) in the indeterminate subtype, and 1/7 (14.3%) of the large duct subtype (P
