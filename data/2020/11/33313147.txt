Background:The role of associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial.Methods:The records of 23 consecutive patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC who underwent ALPPS at our center between November 2013 and June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Oncological results were compared between patients who received ALPPS and those that received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using propensity score matching (PSM) analysis.Results:In patients with a single tumor (n=12) the median tumor diameter was 13.0 (range: 5.1-20.0) cm, whereas in patients with multiple tumors (n=11) the median total tumor diameter was 6.3 (range: 2.3-26.0) cm. After the stage-1 ALPPS, the median future liver remnant (FLR) increased by 50.0%. The stage-2 ALPPS was completed in 20 patients (87.0%) after a median of 12 days. The 90-day mortality rate was 13% (3/23). The overall survival (OS) rates at 1-, 2-, and 5-year were 61.1%, 34.9%, and 8.7%, respectively, whereas the disease-free survival (DFS) rates at 1-, 2-, and 5-year were 27.8%, 27.8%, and 0.0%, respectively. PSM analysis showed no difference in OS between patients who underwent ALPPS and those that received TACE [P=0.178, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A-C patients; P=0.241, BCLC stage B and C patients].Conclusions:ALPPS is a safe and effective treatment option for unresectable HBV-related HCC. However, for HBV-related intermediate and advanced HCC patients, ALPPS may not be superior to TACE.
