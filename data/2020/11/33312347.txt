Cancer-testis antigens (CTA) are tumor antigens, present in the germ cells of testes, ovaries and trophoblasts, which undergo deregulated expression in the tumor and malignant cells. CTA genes are either X-linked or autosomal, favourably expressed in spermatogonia and spermatocytes, respectively. CTAs trigger unprompted humoral immunity and immune responses in malignancies, altering tumor cell physiology and neoplastic behaviors. CTAs demonstrate varied expression profile, with increased abundance in malignant melanoma and prostate, lung, breast and epithelial cell cancers, and a relatively reduced prevalence in intestinal cancer, renal cell adenocarcinoma and malignancies of immune cells. A combination of epigenetic and non-epigenetic agents regulates CTA mRNA expression, with the key participation of CpG islands and CpG-rich promoters, histone methyltransferases, cytokines, tyrosine kinases and transcriptional activators and repressors. CTA triggers gametogenesis, in association with mutated tumorigenic genes and tumor repressors. The CTAs function as potential biomarkers, particularly for prostate, cervical, breast, colorectal, gastric, urinary bladder, liver and lung carcinomas, characterized by alternate splicing and phenotypic heterogeneity in the cells. Additionally, CTAs are prospective targets for vaccine therapy, with the MAGE-A3 and NYESO-1 undergoing clinical trials for tumor regression in malignant melanoma. They have been deemed important for adaptive immunotherapy, marked by limited expression in normal somatic tissues and recurrent up-regulation in epithelial carcinoma. Overall, the current review delineates an up-dated understanding of the intricate processes of CTA expression and regulation in cancer. It further portrays the role of CTAs as biomarkers and probable candidates for tumor immunotherapy, with a future prospect in cancer treatment.
