Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite curative surgical resection, high recurrence of HCC after surgery results in poor patient survival. To develop prognostic markers is therefore important for better prevention and therapy of recurrent HCC to improve patient outcomes. Deletion mutations over the pre-S1 and pre-S2 gene segments of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been closely associated with recurrence of HCC after curative surgical resection. In this study, we applied a next-generation sequencing-based approach to further evaluate the association of pre-S deletion regions with HCC recurrence. We demonstrated that the pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) was the most predominant deletion regions of pre-S gene in plasma of HBV-related HCC patients. Moreover, patients with the pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) exhibited a significantly higher risk of HCC recurrence after curative surgical resection than those without. The pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) in plasma represented a prognostic factor that independently predicted HCC recurrence with greater performance than other clinicopathological and viral factors. Our data suggest that detection of the pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) in plasma may be a promising noninvasive strategy for identifying patients at high risk for HCC recurrence after curative surgical resection.
