Identifying novel prognostic biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and then, develop an effective individualized treatment strategy remain extremely warranted. The prognostic role of sulfiredoxin-1(SRXN1), an antioxidant enzyme, remains unknown in HCC. This study aimed to explore the prognostic implications of SRXN1 in HCC patients after partial hepatectomy. The expression of SRXN1 in HCC and normal tissue were analyzed using the patients from the public databases and Zhongshan Hospital. The Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves were performed to identify the predictive role of SRXN1 expression on HCC patients. A prognostic nomogram based on SRXN1 expression was constructed and validated to further confirm the predictive power of SRXN1 as a prognostic biomarker. Finally, functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network analysis of SRXN1 and its associated genes were conducted. The results showed that SRXN1 was upregulated in HCC samples compared with the normal liver tissues. Patients with SRXN1 upregulation had shorter survival time. SRXN1 overexpression was significantly correlated with advanced clinicopathological parameters. The prognostic nomogram based on SRXN1 expression was proved to be more accurate than routine staging systems for the prediction of overall survival. Protein-protein interaction network analysis demonstrated the first neighbor genes of SRXN1 mainly participated in response to oxidative stress. In brief, SRXN1 could be a prognostic biomarker for the management of HCC.
