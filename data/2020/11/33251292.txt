Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare variant of hepatocellular carcinoma not associated with cirrhosis or viral hepatitis. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels are usually normal; the histology is of a well-differentiated tumor, and the staging is the same as for hepatocellular carcinoma. We describe the case of a female patient in her 4th decade of life with a diagnosis of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma with a multimodal approach. The rare incidence of this cancer and its unusual clinical presentation justifies reporting this case and highlights the importance of multidisciplinary teams in the treatment of cancer patients.
