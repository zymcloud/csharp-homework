Transcriptome analysis enables the study of gene expression in human tissues and is a valuable tool to characterise liver function and gene expression dynamics during liver disease, as well as to identify prognostic markers or signatures, and to facilitate discovery of new therapeutic targets. In contrast to whole tissue RNA sequencing analysis, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics enables the study of transcriptional activity at the single cell or spatial level. ScRNA-seq has paved the way for the discovery of previously unknown cell types and subtypes in normal and diseased liver, facilitating the study of rare cells (such as liver progenitor cells) and the functional roles of non-parenchymal cells in chronic liver disease and cancer. By adding spatial information to scRNA-seq data, spatial transcriptomics has transformed our understanding of tissue functional organisation and cell-to-cell interactions in situ. These approaches have recently been applied to investigate liver regeneration, organisation and function of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, and to profile the single cell landscape of chronic liver diseases and cancer. Herein, we review the principles and technologies behind scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic approaches, highlighting the recent discoveries and novel insights these methodologies have yielded in both liver physiology and disease biology.
