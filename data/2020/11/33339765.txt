Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major form of primary liver cancer and one of the most prevalent and life-threatening malignancies globally. One of the hallmarks in HCC is the sustained cell survival and proliferative signals, which are determined by the balance between oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is an effective growth inhibitor of epithelial cells including hepatocytes, through induction of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cellular senescence, or autophagy. The antitumorigenic effects of TGF-β are bypassed during liver tumorigenesis via multiple mechanisms. Furthermore, along with malignant progression, TGF-β switches to promote cancer cell survival and proliferation. This dichotomous nature of TGF-β is one of the barriers to therapeutic targeting in liver cancer. Thereafter, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is a prerequisite for discovering novel antitumor drugs that may specifically disable the growth-promoting branch of TGF-β signaling or restore its tumor-suppressive arm. This review summarizes how TGF-β inhibits or promotes liver cancer cell survival and proliferation, highlighting the functional switch mechanisms during the process.
