Background:Several biomarkers of gemcitabine effectiveness have been studied in cancers, but less so in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is identified as the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Investigation of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (HENT-1) and deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), genes involved in gemcitabine uptake and metabolism, can be beneficial in the selection of potential cancer patients who could be responding to the treatment.Aim:To study HENT-1 and DCK gene expression in HCC patients with different protocols of treatment.Methods:Using real-time PCR, we analyzed expression levels of HENT-1 and DCK genes from peripheral blood samples of 109 patients (20 controls & 89 HCC patients) between March 2015 and March 2017. All the 89 HCC patients received the antioxidants selenium (Se) and vitamin E (Vit.E) either alone (45 patients) or in combination with gemcitabine (24 patients) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (20 patients).Results:There was a significant increase in HENT-1 expression levels in HCC patients treated with Se and Vit.E alone as compared to controls (P ˂ .0001), while there was no significant difference between HCC patients treated with gemcitabine or RFA as compared to controls. In contrast, expression of DCK was significantly increased in all groups of HCC patients as compared to controls (P ˂ .0001).Conclusions:HENT-1 and DCK mRNA expressions are important markers of HCC and for GEM effect and GEM sensitivity in patients with HCC. This could be beneficial in the selection of HCC patients sensitive to gemcitabine to avoid subjecting resistant patients to unnecessary chemotherapy.
