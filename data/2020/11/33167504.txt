Ginkgolide C (GGC) derived from Ginkgo biloba, has been reported to exhibit various biological functions. However, the anti-neoplastic effect of GGC and its mechanisms in liver cancer have not been studied previously. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition receptor (c-Met) pathway can regulate tumor growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-neoplastic effect of GGC against HCC cells and we observed that GGC inhibited HGF-induced c-Met and c-Met downstream oncogenic pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK. In addition, GGC also suppressed the proliferation of expression of diverse tumorigenic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Survivin, IAP-1, IAP-2, Cyclin D1, and COX-2) and induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the silencing of c-Met by small interfering RNA (siRNA) mitigated c-Met expression and enhanced GGC-induced apoptosis. Moreover, it was noted that GGC also significantly reduced the invasion and migration of HCC cells. Overall, the data clearly demonstrate that GGC exerts its anti-neoplastic activity through modulating c-Met phosphorylation and may be used as an effective therapy against HCC.
