Numerous studies have reported the association of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancers, yet the function of lncRNA high expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HEIH) in esophageal carcinoma (EC) has seldom been explored. Here, we aimed to explore the mechanism of HEIH on EC via microRNA-185 (miR-185)/kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) modulation. Cancer and non-tumoral tissues were collected, in which HEIH, miR-185 and KLK5 expression were detected, as well as their correlations. Also, the relation between the prognosis of EC patients and HEIH/miR-185/KLK5 expression was clarified. EC cells (KYSE-30 and TE-1) were screened for subsequent gain- and loss-of-function assays and their biological functions were further monitored. Tumor volume and weight in EC mice were also measured. Results from this study indicated that HEIH and KLK5 were elevated and miR-185 was declined in EC. The positive correlation was seen in HEIH and KLK5 expression, while the negative correlation was observed in HEIH or KLK5 and miR-185 expression. High HEIH and KLK5 indicated worse prognosis and high miR-185 suggested better prognosis of EC patients. Depleting HEIH or restoring miR-185 suppressed the malignant phenotypes of EC cells, and delayed tumor growth in EC mice. HEIH was found to bind with miR-185 to regulate KLK5 expression. Overexpressing KLK5 alone promoted EC cell progression while up-regulating miR-185 reversed such effects on EC cells. Collectively, we reveal that HEIH depletion dampens EC progression by upregulating miR-185 and downregulating KLK5, which provides novel treatments for EC.
