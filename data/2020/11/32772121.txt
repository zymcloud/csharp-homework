Dual-energy CT (DECT) can be defined as the use of two different energy levels to identify and quantify material composition. Since its inception, DECT has benefited from remarkable improvements in hardware and clinical applications. DECT enables accurate identification and quantification of multiple materials, including fat, iron, and iodine. As a consequence, multiple studies have investigated the potential role of DECT in the assessment of diffuse liver diseases. While this role is evolving, this article aims to review the most relevant literature on use of DECT for assessment of diffuse liver diseases. Moreover, the basic concepts on DECT techniques, types of image reconstruction, and DECT-dedicated software will be described, focusing on the areas that are most relevant for the evaluation of diffuse liver diseases. Also, we will review the evidence of added value of DECT in detection and assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma which is a known risk in patients with diffuse liver disease.
