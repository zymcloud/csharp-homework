Liver damage involves oxidative stress and a progression from chronic hepatitis to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The increased incidence of liver disease in Egypt and other countries in the last decade, coupled with poor prognosis, justify the critical need to introduce alternative chemopreventive agents that may protect against liver damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of exopolysaccharide-peptide (PSP) complex extracted from Pleurotus ostreatus as a hepatoprotective agent against diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/carbon tetrachloride (CCL4)-induced hepatocellular damage in rats. The levels of liver injury markers (ALT, AST and ALP) were substantially increased following DEN/CCl4 treatment. DEN/CCl4 - induced oxidative stress was confirmed by elevated levels of lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, and reduced glutathione. PSP reversed these alterations in the liver and serum, and provided protection evidenced by reversal of histopathological changes in the liver. The present study demonstrated that PSP extract from P. ostreatus exhibited hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects against DEN/CCl4-induced hepatocellular damage in rats. Given the high prevalence of HCV-related liver damage in Egypt, our results suggest further clinical evaluation of P. ostreatus extracts and their potential hepatoprotective effects in patients with liver disease.
