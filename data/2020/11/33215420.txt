Objective:Ring finger protein 6 (RNF6) has been identified to be associated with the progression of colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and breast cancer. Its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, remains largely unclear. This study aims to illustrate the prognostic potential of RNF6 in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-HCC.Patients and methods:A total of 162 eligible NAFLD-HCC patients treated in our hospital from May 2017 to May 2019 were recruited. RNF levels in the collected tumor tissues and paracancerous tissues were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Then, the influences of RNF6 on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in NAFLD-HCC patients were explored. Potential clinical factors for the prognosis in NAFLD-HCC were finally analyzed.Results:RNF6 was upregulated in NAFLD-HCC tissues. Highly expressed RNF6 at both mRNA and protein levels predicted poor OS and RFS in NAFLD-HCC. RNF6 level, metastasis, tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging, and tumor grade were correlated with the prognosis in NAFLD-HCC.Conclusions:Great effects have been made on improving the diagnostic rate. Here, highly expressed RNF6 was unfavorable to OS and RFS in NAFLD-HCC. As a result, RNF6 not only contributed to the diagnosis of NAFLD-HCC, but also predicted its prognosis and recurrence.
