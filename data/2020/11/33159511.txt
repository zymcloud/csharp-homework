Objective:To evaluate the potential diagnostic value of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) alone and its combination with protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Serum levels of GDF15, PIVKA-II, and AFP were measured in 110 patients with HBV-associated HCC, 70 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 70 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 110 healthy patients.Results:Serum GDF15 was positively related to the levels of PIVKA-II and AFP in patients with HCC (r = 0.352 and r = 0.378; all P Conclusion:We found that GDF15 is a potent serum marker for the detection of HBV-associated HCC and that PIVKA-II combined with GDF15 can improve diagnostic accuracy for HBV-associated HCC.
