A 72-year-old man underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) located on the S6 segment. He had a history of anti-viral therapy for hepatitis C virus and was being treated for diabetes mellitus with inadequate control. On day 28 after TACE, he visited our hospital again, with complaints of fever and abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. Blood examination showed elevated levels of white blood cells and C-reactive protein. Computed tomography showed a poorly marginated, low-density lesion measuring 9.5 × 8.0 × 4.0 cm, forming multiple small gas bubbles, located superiorly, and in contact with HCC treated by TACE. Ultrasound-guided puncture revealed whiffy and muddy pus. Gram staining of the pus showed the presence of numerous gram-positive rods, which were identified as Cutibacterium namnetense. He underwent percutaneous trans-hepatic abscess drainage and received antibiotics treatment. The abscess was successfully treated, and he was discharged on day 19. The incidence of liver abscess after TACE is rare, and intestinal microbiota have been reported to be the common pathogens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of liver abscess caused by Cutibacterium namnetense.
