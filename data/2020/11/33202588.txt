Liver transplantation (LT) remains a mainstay of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tumor factors such as size and number of tumors define eligibility for LT using the Milan criteria. The tumor burden score (TBS) incorporates both tumor number and size into a single continuous variable and has been used to differentiate prognosis among patients undergoing resection for HCC. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the ability of the TBS to predict overall and recurrence-free survival in patients undergoing LT for HCC. The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) was used to analyze all liver transplants for HCC, with initial tumor size data from 2004 to 2018. There were 12,486 patients in the study period. In the unadjusted analyses, patients with a high TBS had worse overall (p < 0.0001) and recurrence-free (p < 0.0001) survival. In the adjusted analyses, a high TBS was associated with a greater hazard ratio (HR) of death (HR = 1.21; 95%CI, [1.13-1.30]; p < 0.001) and recurrence (HR = 1.49; 95%CI [1.3-1.7]; p < 0.001). When we superimposed the TBS on the Milan criteria, we saw that a higher TBS was associated with a higher hazard of recurrence at values that were either all within (HR = 1.20; 95%CI, [1.04-1.37]; p = 0.011) or variably within (HR = 1.53; 95%CI, [1.16-2.01]; p = 0.002) the Milan criteria. In conclusion, the TBS is a promising tool in predicting outcomes in patients with HCC after LT.
