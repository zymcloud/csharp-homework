Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has the tendency to invade the portal and/or hepatic venous system. The invasion of the right atrium is uncommonly observed and constitutes a treatment challenge. We report the case of a patient with HCC invading the right atrium treated with 90Yttrium-transarterial radioembolization (90Y-TARE). Following the treatment, organizing pneumonia secondary to nivolumab occurred, raising the question of an interaction between 90Y-TARE and nivolumab.
