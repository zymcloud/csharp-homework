Background:While the associations between individual lifestyle factors and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been described previously, their combined impact on HCC risk is unknown.Methods:The association of a composite score of healthy lifestyle factors, including body mass index, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, alternative Mediterranean diet, and sleep duration, and HCC risk was examined in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study of 63,257 Chinese men and women. Cox proportional hazard regression method was used to estimate HR and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Conditional logistic regression method was used to evaluate this composite lifestyle score-HCC risk association among a subset of individuals who tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis C antibody.Results:After a mean follow-up of 17.7 years, 561 participants developed HCC. Individuals with higher composite scores representing healthier lifestyles (range 0-8) were at significantly lower risk of HCC. Compared with the lowest composite score category (0-4), the HRs (95% CIs) for the composite scores of 5, 6, 7, and 8 were 0.67 (0.62-0.85), 0.61 (0.48-0.77), 0.49 (0.37-0.65), and 0.13 (0.06-0.30), respectively (P trend < 0.0001). A similar inverse association was observed in participants with negative HBsAg and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative serology (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.19-0.79; for the highest vs. the lowest category of the composite scores; P trend = 0.001).Conclusion:Healthy lifestyles protect against HCC development, especially for individuals without hepatitis B virus and HCV infections.Impact:This study highlights the importance of a comprehensive lifestyle modification strategy for HCC primary prevention.
