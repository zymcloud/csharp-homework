In this data file the synthetic procedures for preparation of the original 4-pyridinium-1,4-dihydropyridines (4-Py-1,4-DHP) and their parent compounds - dialkyl 2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-pyridyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylates were described. In total, 5 unpublished compounds were obtained and characterised. All the structures of original compounds were confirmed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR, including 1H NMR and 13C NMR) and low resolution mass spectra (MS) data. Additionally, the cytotoxic properties of four 4-Py-1,4-DHPs were evaluated on 3 cell lines - normal NIH3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblast), cancerous HT-1080 (human lung fibrosarcoma) and MH-22A (mouse hepatoma) and self-assembling properties were studied and characterisation of formed nanoparticles were performed using dynamic light scattering technique. In this article provided data are directly related to the previously published research articles - "Novel cationic amphiphilic 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives for DNA delivery" [1] where compound 5 was tested as gene delivery agent without full physico-chemical characterisation and "Synthesis and studies of calcium channel blocking and antioxidant activities of novel 4-pyridinium and/or N-propargyl substituted 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives" [2] where synthesis and physico-chemical characterisation as well as calcium channel blocking and antioxidant activities were described for compound 6. Synthesis of other compounds - parent 1,4-DHPs 1 and 2, and 4-Py-1,4-DHPs 3-5, their characterisation, estimation of cytotoxicity and self-assembling properties for all 4-Py-1,4-DHPs 3-6 are reported herein for the first time. Information provided in this data file can be used in medicinal chemistry by other scientists to estimate structure-activity relationships for the analysis and construction of various cationic 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives and related heterocycles.
