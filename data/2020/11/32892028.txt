Radio-resistance is a major hurdle challenging oncologist worldwide. Despite their anti-cancer characteristics, the implication of phytochemicals in clinical trials is still limited. This study is designed to evaluate the anticancer characteristics and radio-sensitizing effect of a cocktail of seven phytochemicals on HepG2 cells. Characterization of phytochemicals combination phenolic and flavonoids content as well as their scavenging activity were tested. The effective concentration of BSG that will be used as a radio-sensitizing dose was calculated using AlamarBlue assay. Treatment of HepG2 cells with BSG and/or ionizing radiations led to significant downregulation at cell proliferation as indicated by the decrease of colony formation ratio, proliferation marker (Ki67) expression as well as G2/M cell cycle arrest. The combined treatment stimulated P53-dependent apoptosis which was indicated by the significant increase of early apoptosis marker (Annexin V) expression, DNA fragmentation, expression of P53 & Bax and downregulation of Bcl2 expression. Combined treatment significantly attenuated HepG2 cell motility which was validated using wound healing migration assay and the significant reduction at CD95 expression. This study demonstrates the anti-cancer effect of BSG and its fundamental role in provoking cell responsiveness to IR leading to a significant inhibition at HepG2 cell proliferation, survival and migration.
