Objective:To investigate the effect of enteral nutrition combined with accelerated rehabilitation in treating the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods:It is a randomized controlled experiment to be carried out from June 2021 to December 2021. It was permitted through the Ethics Committee of Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University (00923876). 100 patients are included in the study. The inclusion criteria contain: (1) patients with NSCLCs receiving surgery as the primary treatment; (2) over 18 years of age. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) age â‰¥65 years; (2) severe metabolic and systemic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, or severe liver and kidney dysfunction; (3) the body mass index <18.5 kg/m; (4) patients who have received preoperational radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Patients in the control group are provided routine nutrition, including preoperative nutritional risk screening and assessment and preoperative nutrition education and dietary guidance, while patients in the nutrition group are provided additional enteral nutrition preparations combined with accelerated rehabilitation as in the control group. The primary outcomes include the perioperative change of serum albumin, serum prealbumin, hemoglobin, and total lymphocyte counts. The second outcomes include length of hospitalization, quality of life, and risk of postoperative complications.Results:shows the comparison of indicators after surgery between the 2 groups.Conclusion:Enteral nutrition combined with accelerated rehabilitation appears to be beneficial in decreasing the complications and improving postoperative recovery after NSCLC surgery.
