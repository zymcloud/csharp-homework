Background:Studies have shown significant improvement in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence rates after liver transplantation since the united network of organ sharing (UNOS) implementation of a 6-month wait period prior to accrued exception model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) points enacted on October 8, 2015. However, few have examined the impact on HCC dropout rates for patients awaiting liver transplant. Our objective is to evaluate the outcomes of HCC dropout rates before and after the mandatory 6-month wait policy enacted.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study on adult patients added to the liver transplant wait list between January 1, 2012, and March 8, 2019 (n = 767). Information was obtained through electronic medical records and organ procurement and transplant network (OPTN) publicly available national data reports.Results:In response to the 2015 UNOS-mandated 6-month wait time, dropout rates in the HCC patient population at our center increased from 12% pre-mandate to 20.8% post-mandate This increase was similarly reflected in the national dropout rate, which also increased from 26.3% pre-mandate to 29.0% post-mandate.Discussion:From these changes, it is evident that the UNOS mandate achieved its goal of increasing equity of liver organ allocation, but HCC patients are nonetheless dropping off of the wait list at an increased rate and are therefore disadvantaged.
