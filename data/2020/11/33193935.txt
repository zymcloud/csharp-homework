Alagille syndrome (AS) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder which can lead to hepatopathy and the development of focal hepatic lesions. The majority of the hepatic lesions are benign, including regenerative nodules, focal hyperplasia, and adenoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely rare in AS, with very few cases reported in the literature. A 38-year-old man complaining of acute right upper quadrant pain with long-standing diagnosis of Alagille syndrome. On imaging, the patient had a large hepatic mass in the right lobe, with arterial hyperenhancement, washout appearance, and areas of internal hemorrhage. The patient underwent a right hepatectomy and histopathology demonstrated HCC. The patient passed away 3 months after the surgery due to infectious complications. HCC is a rare complication of AS, although rare, it should be considered. This case also emphasizes the need of HCC screening in patients with AS in order to allow an early diagnosis and treatment, which can improve patients' outcome.
