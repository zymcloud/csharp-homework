Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most commonly diagnosed malignant tumor and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. As a novel non-coding RNA, LINC00657 was firstly identified as an oncogenic role in breast cancer. However, few research focus on the effect of LINC00657 on the progression of HCC.Objectives:The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of LINC00657 on HCC tissues and cells, and further explore the potential mechanism.Methods:We first measured the expression of LINC00657 in HCC tissues and cell lines using qRT-PCR. Next we established LINC00657 knockdown in HCC cells. CCK-8 assay, cell invasion assay, flow cytometry analysis, qRT-PCR and western blotting were applied to assess the role of LINC00657 knockdown in the biological behavior of HCC cells. The bioinformatics analysis and the rescue experiment were devoted to the underlying mechanism.Results:LINC00657 was remarkably overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, associated with poor prognosis. LINC00657 knockdown repressed cell proliferation and invasion, promoted cell apoptosis of HCC cell lines. The bioinformatics analysis showed LINC00657 sponged miR-424 as a ceRNA. Besides, PD-L1 mimic rescued the suppression of si-LINC00657 in the biological behavior of HCC cells.Conclusion:In a word, we observed LINC00657 regulated PD-L1 expression by sponging miR-424, thus affecting the developments of hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings LINC00657 may provide new evidence for therapeutic application in hepatocellular carcinoma.
