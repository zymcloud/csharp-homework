Aim:The present study focuses on the development and evaluation of the resveratrol (RV)-loaded cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (RV-c-SLNs) for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Optimization of formulation was performed using factorial design, and further in vitro drug release, cytotoxicity, biodistribution, in vivo preclinical, and biochemical evaluation were carried out.Results:The optimized formulation exhibited uniform size, homogeneous disparity, positive zeta potential, and stability over 12-week storage at 25Â°C/60% RH. The in vitro drug release and cytotoxicity study showed 60% drug release within the first 6 hours and comparatively higher cytotoxicity on HepG2 cell line by resveratrol-solid lipid nanoparticle (RV-SLN) as compared to the RV solution. In addition, an anticancer action and biodistribution study on a rat model of HCC showed significant reduction of tumor volume and higher accumulation in the tumor tissue from RV-c-SLN (P<0.01) over RV solution and RV-SLN. Furthermore, RV-c-SLN showed significant down-regulation in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and balancing of antioxidant enzymes. Histopathological investigation showed reduced occurrence of hepatic nodules, necrosis formation, infiltration of inflammatory cells, blood vessels inflammation, and cell swelling.Conclusion:Overall, the obtained results construed that RV-c-SLN with improved antitumor activity as clearly evident from in vitro, in vivo, and biochemical investigations.
