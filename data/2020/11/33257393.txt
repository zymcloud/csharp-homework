Metastatic spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) to the gastrointestinal tract is a rare entity. A 63-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled HIV and a recurrent cSCC on the right temple presented with functional decline, ascites and shortness of breath. A CT scan showed widespread metastatic malignancy involving lung, pleura, heart, stomach, liver, retroperitoneum and soft-tissue. In the case presented here, an upper endoscopy revealed a submucosal lesion in the stomach. Biopsies described the lesion as a poorly differentiated SCC. Comprehensive genomic profiling yielded striking molecular similarities between the gastric tumour and the patient's prior cSCC. It confirmed the origin of the disease and excluded spread from an occult primary. This case adds to the limited literature on gastrointestinal metastases of cSCC and serves as a reminder that non-AIDS-defining cancers are on the rise in the HIV-population.
