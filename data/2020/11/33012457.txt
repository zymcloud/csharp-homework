Historically, systemic treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma was limited to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib. With the recent approval of several new agents the armamentarium of treatment options available to providers and patients has expanded. Although these promising advances offer hope for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, they also present new and challenging adverse effects that threaten to limit their efficacy. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors introduce immune-related adverse events, which may affect a wide array of organ systems. With prompt recognition, however, common side effects of systemic therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma are predictable, manageable, and many improve with appropriate intervention.
