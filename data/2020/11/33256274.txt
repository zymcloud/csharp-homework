Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in China. Currently, hepatectomy, radiofrequency ablation, interventional therapy, and so on are widely used in the treatment of liver cancer; however the 5-year survival rate of patients is still very poor. The onset of liver cancer is insidious, and most patients do not have the opportunity to undergo surgery when they are initially diagnosed. In addition, patients with advanced liver cancer lack effective treatment, which is mainly due to chronic inflammation of the liver. Immunotherapy has great potential advantages in the treatment of liver cancer, so it has attracted more and more researchers' attention. Importantly, with the development of biomedical science into the era of precision medicine, more precise and effective immunotherapy strategies for HCC treatment have been explored, thus bringing new hope to HCC patients. This article reviews the research status and progress of liver cancer immunotherapy in the context of precision medicine.
