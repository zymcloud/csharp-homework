Background:Globally, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major public health concern. Timely and effective management can prevent disease progression to cirrhosis and reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, there is no consensus on the clinical management of CHB in East Asia.Aim:To establish an East Asia expert opinion on treatment initiation for CHB based on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level, cirrhosis and HCC risk scores.Methods:A meeting was held online with a panel of 10 experts from East Asia to discuss ALT, HBV DNA, cirrhosis and HCC risk scores. Indications for CHB treatment in the latest international guidelines were reviewed. Consensus was summarised to provide recommendations on the initiation of treatment for CHB.Results:Anti-viral therapy is recommended for CHB patients with (a) HBV DNA ≥ 2000 IU/mL and ALT ≥ 1× upper limit of normal (ULN); (b) HBV DNA ≥ 2000 IU/mL, ALT 40 years. Patients with cirrhosis and/or HCC should be treated regardless of ALT levels if HBV DNA level is detectable. Initiating anti-viral therapy or close monitoring at 3-month intervals is recommended for CHB patients with at least two HCC risk factors.Conclusions:These expert recommendations will contribute to a new standard of daily clinical practice in East Asia.
