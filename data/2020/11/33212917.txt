Background and aim:Transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting microspheres (DEM-TACE) is recommended for patients with BCLC stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and stage 0-A unsuitable for curative treatments. We assessed efficacy and safety along with hepatobiliary toxicities (HBT) of DEM-TACE using a novel microsphere, LifePearlTM, loaded with anthracyclines.Materials and methods:97 patients diagnosed with HCC were prospectively enrolled and treated using LifePearlTM loaded with doxorubicin (77%) or idarubicin (23%). Safety and tolerability were assessed using CTCAE, HBT by CT/MRI scans, and tumor response by applying modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Follow-up was after 2 years.Results:Adverse events (AE) were reported in 73.2% of patients, majority being Grade 1-2. Grade â‰¥ 3 AE reported in 13.4% of patients were mainly related to postembolization syndrome. HBT were observed after 15.5% (29/187) of the DEM-TACEs. Objective response and disease control rates were 81% and 99%, respectively, as the best responses. Survival rates at one and two years were 81% and 66%, respectively, while the median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Median progression free survival was 13.7 months (95% CI: 11.3; 15.6) and median time to TACE untreatable progression was 16.7 months (95% CI: 12.7; not estimable (n.e.)).Conclusions:DEM-TACE using LifePearlTM provides a high tumor response rate in HCC patients. HBT rates within or below previously reported results for cTACE and DEM-TACE indicate a good safety profile for LifePearlTM. The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov National Library of Medicine (ID: NCT03053596).
