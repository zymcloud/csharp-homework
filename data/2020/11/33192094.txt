Immunotherapy provided with checkpoint inhibitors such as the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor or its ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein has been shown to be effective for treating several types of cancer, and was recently approved for use in treating malignant melanoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer, and additional forms of cancer. However, there is little evidence concerning its effectiveness in treating thymic squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). Here, we report two cases of refractory TSCC that were treated with PD-1 single/combination therapy in a clinical setting. The patients exhibited variable responses to therapy without any serious adverse events. In summary, our findings show that immunotherapy provided with an immuno-checkpoint inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy/anti-angiogenesis therapy can improve the treatment response of patients with refractory TSCC. Anti-PD-1 single/combination therapy may be used as a strategy for treating advanced refractory TC.
