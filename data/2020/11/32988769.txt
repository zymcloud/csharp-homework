Background:No virologic cure exists for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and existing therapies are designed to control viral replication. We aimed to estimate the national prevalence of HBsAg in 2017 and study the impact of an enhanced diagnosis rate and universal treatment administration on HBV-related outcomes in Saudi Arabia.Materials and methods:A dynamic transmission and disease burden model was developed to estimate the future economic burden of HBV infection. The infected population was tracked by age and gender-defined cohorts; direct costs (healthcare, screening, diagnostics and treatment) and indirect costs (disability-adjusted life years and the value of a statistical life year) were calculated. The impact of two intervention scenarios (Achieve WHO Targets: diagnose 90% of infections and treat 80% of high viral load patients by 2030; and Diagnose and Treat All: diagnose and treat all infected patients by 2022) were compared against the Base Case scenario (no policy action), with near-universal vaccination coverage rates held constant. A sensitivity analysis of future treatment cost was also conducted.Results:In 2017, HBsAg prevalence was estimated at 1.7%, corresponding to 574,000 infections. The same year, there was an estimated incidence of 490 cases of decompensated cirrhosis, 1500 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 1740 liver-related deaths (LRD). HBsAg prevalence was 0.1% among 5-year-olds and Conclusions:Increased diagnosis and treatment rates of HBV would lead to substantial declines in HCC and LRD. This effect would be dramatically enhanced by administering treatment to all HBV cases regardless of viral load and estimated to be highly cost-effective if treatment prices can be substantially reduced.
