Benfluralin is an herbicide of the dinitroaniline class used to control grasses and weeds. In a 2 year dietary study in rats, benfluralin increased incidences of thyroid follicular adenoma and carcinoma at high dietary concentrations (â‰¥2500 ppm). The benfluralin toxicology database suggests the mode of action (MOA) is initiated by induction of liver metabolizing enzymes, particularly thyroid hormone specific UGTs, a major pathway for T4 clearance in rats. As reported with phenobarbital, this effect triggers negative feedback regulation, increasing thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) release into circulating blood. When sustained over time, this leads to thyroid changes such as follicular hypertrophy, hyperplasia and thyroid follicular tumors with chronic exposures. The described MOA was previously established in rat studies with various chemical activators of xenobiotic receptors in the liver. It is generally considered as non-relevant in humans, due to differences between humans and rats in T4 turnover and susceptibility to this carcinogenic MOA. A structured methodology based on the IPCS/MOA/Human Relevance framework was used in the evaluation of available benfluralin data, and the conclusion was determined that the carcinogenic potential of benfluralin in the thyroid is not relevant in humans.
