Background:We investigated the combined effects of sarcopenia and inflammation on outcomes in patients with HCC treated with nivolumab.Materials and methods:We reviewed 102 patients treated with nivolumab between 2017 and 2018. Sarcopenia was diagnosed when the L3 skeletal muscle indices were 2/m2 and < 38 cm2/m2 in men and women, respectively. Baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and absolute lymphocyte count were used as surrogate markers of inflammation and immune cell reservoir. High NLR (hNLR) was defined as NLR ≥ 3, and severe lymphopenia (sLP) was defined as lymphocyte < 800/μL. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed.Results:With a median follow-up of 21.9 (interquartile range, 8.3-58.3) months, patients with sarcopenia showed shorter OS than those without sarcopenia (median, 2.9 vs. 7.5 months, respectively). Patients with either hNLR or sLP exhibited inferior survival than those without risk factor (median OS, 2.8 vs. 14.5 months; median PFS, 1.3 vs. 3.7 months, respectively). Among 70 patients treated with RT, benefit of RT was observed in patients with sarcopenia or those without hNLR/sLP (all p Conclusion:The current study hypothetically demonstrated that the risk group stratified by hNLR/sLP outweighs the significance of sarcopenia in predicting outcomes after nivolumab. Furthermore, patients with sarcopenia might benefit from RT, especially those without risk factors of hNLR/sLP.
