Background:The recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after partial hepatectomy is still high. How to choose the most appropriate anti-tumor drug in the early postoperative period is crucial to improve the prognosis of patients. Recently, MiniPDX has been widely used as a new and reliable preclinical research model capable of predicting the sensitivities of anti-tumor drugs.Methods:Twenty-eight patients with HCC were selected to use the MiniPDX model to screen the most sensitive anti-tumor drugs from five groups of drug regimens for preventive treatment after partial hepatectomy, and another 42 patients with HCC were selected to be treated with Sorafenib during the same period as the control group. The tumor-free survival rate and overall survival rate were analyzed and compared between these two groups. The relationship between drug sensitivity and biomarkers related to HCC was also analyzed.Results:Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that the tumor-free survival (DFS) of patients in the MiniPDX group was significantly longer than that in the control group (median DFS: 25.8 months vs. 18.2 months, P = 0.022, HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.17-4.12). The overall survival (OS) of the patients in the MiniPDX group was also longer than that in the control group (median OS: 29.4 months vs. 23.8 months, P = 0.039, HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.12-5.00). The longest follow-up period was 36 months. The relationship analyzed between the efficacy of the five drugs (Regorafenib, Regorafenib, Lenvatinib, Gemcitabine, 5-FU + Oxaliplatin) and AFP, Ki-67, VEGFR, FGFR, P53, and Nrf2 showed different correlations.Conclusion:The use of the MiniPDX model to select drugs to guide anti-tumor treatment after partial hepatectomy could effectively prolong the survival of patients with HCC.
