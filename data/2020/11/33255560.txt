Circulating periostin has been suggested as a possible biomarker in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Asian studies. In the present study, we aimed to test its still controversial relevance in a Caucasian population. In patients with histologically-proven NAFLD (N. = 74; 10 with hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC) plasma periostin concentrations were analyzed. POSTN haplotype analysis was based on rs9603226, rs3829365, and rs1029728. Hepatitis C patients (N. = 81, 7 HCC) and healthy subjects (N. = 27) were used as controls. The median plasma periostin concentration was 11.6 ng/mL without differences amongst groups; it was not influenced by age, liver fibrosis or steatosis. However, possession of haplotype two (rs9603226 = G, rs3829365 = C, rs1028728 = A) was associated with lower circulating periostin compared to other haplotypes. Moreover, periostin was higher in HCC patients. At multivariate analysis, HCC remained the only predictor of high periostin. In conclusion, plasma periostin concentrations in Caucasians NAFLD patients are not influenced by the degree of liver disease, but are significantly higher in HCC. Genetically-determined differences may account for some of the variability. These data suggest extreme caution in predicting a possible future role of periostin antagonists as a rational therapeutic alternative for NAFLD, but show a potential periostin role in the management of NAFLD-associated HCC.
