The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is widely adopted for the noninvasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, possible strategies to improve the diagnostic performance of LR-5 without reducing specificity for HCC were investigated. This retrospective study included 792 patients who underwent gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Hepatic observations were categorized according to LI-RADS v2018 and categories were readjusted by upgrading LR4 to LR5 using ancillary features, arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) interpreted with subtraction images, indication of no washout when APHE was absent, extension of washout to the transitional phase, and subthreshold growth as a major feature. Based on LI-RADS v2018, LR-5 showed a sensitivity of 71.9% and a specificity of 97.9% for the diagnosis of HCC. Category-readjusted LR-5 after upgrading LR-4 to LR-5 using ancillary features favoring HCC in particular, subthreshold growth as a major feature, extending washout to transitional phase and APHE interpreted using subtraction images showed significantly increased sensitivity (P0.05). The sensitivity of LR-5 can be improved without loss of specificity via category readjustment using AFs favoring HCC in particular, subthreshold growth as a major feature, extending washout to transitional phase and APHE interpreted with subtraction images.
