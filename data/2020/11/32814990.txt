Purpose:To develop an effective prognostic nomogram for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after thermal ablation.Methods:A total of 772 patients with intrahepatic primary or recurrent HCC who underwent radiofrequency ablation or microwave ablation between March 2011 and October 2016 were included. 602 patients (mean age, 56.0 ± 11.9 years; 495 male/107 female) were included in the primary cohort to establish a prognostic nomogram. Significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) identified by Cox univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to construct the nomogram. The remaining 170 patients (mean age, 55.9 ± 11.9 years; 145 male/25 female) were used to validate the predictive accuracy of the nomogram.Results:During a mean follow-up period of 26 months (range 1-85 months), the median OS periods were 48.6 months and 44.0 months for the primary and validation cohorts. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 85.5%, 61.4%, and 43.3% in the primary cohort and 84.7%, 59.6%, and 43.3% in the prospective validation cohort, respectively. Multivariate analysis found that pre-ablation treatment, AFP, CEA, CA19-9, ALBI grade, tumor number, and tumor size (hazard ratio > 1, P Conclusions:This simple nomogram based on seven variables including ALBI grade offers personalized prognostic data for HCC patients after ablation.Level of evidence:Level 4, case series.
