Introduction: Persistent inflammation and hypoxia are strong stimulus for pathological angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, and are also the most important elements resulting in liver fibrosis. Sustained inflammatory process stimulates fibrosis to the end-point of cirrhosis and sinusoidal portal hypertension is an important feature of cirrhosis. Neovascularization plays a pivotal role in collateral circulation formation of portal vein, mesenteric congestion, and high perfusion. Imbalance of hepatic artery and portal vein blood flow leads to the increase of hepatic artery inflow, which is beneficial to the formation of nodules. Angiogenesis contributes to progression from liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and anti-angiogenesis therapy can improve liver fibrosis, reduce portal pressure, and prolong overall survival of patients with HCC. Areas covers: This paper will try to address the difference of the morphological characteristics and mechanisms of neovascularization in the process from liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and HCC and further compare the different efficacy of anti-angiogenesis therapy in these three stages. Expert opinion: More in-depth understanding of the role of angiogenesis factors and the relationship between angiogenesis and other aspects of the pathogenesis and transformation may be the key to enabling future progress in the treatment of patients with liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC.
