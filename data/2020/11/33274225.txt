Purpose:To identify pivotal differentially expressed miRNAs and genes and construct their regulatory network in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:mRNA (GSE101728) and microRNA (GSE108724) microarray datasets were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, we identified the differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. Sequentially, transcription factor enrichment and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for miRNA were performed. Target genes of these differential miRNAs were obtained using packages in R language (R package multiMiR). After that, downregulated miRNAs were matched with target mRNAs which were upregulated, while upregulated miRNAs were paired with downregulated target mRNA using scripts written in Perl. An miRNA-mRNA network was constructed and visualized in Cytoscape software. For miRNAs in the network, survival analysis was performed. And for genes in the network, we did gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis.Results:A total of 35 miRNAs and 295 mRNAs were involved in the network. These differential genes were enriched in positive regulation of cell-cell adhesion, positive regulation of leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, and so on. Eight differentially expressed miRNAs were found to be associated with the OS of patients with HCC. Among which, miR-425 and miR-324 were upregulated while the other six, including miR-99a, miR-100, miR-125b, miR-145, miR-150, and miR-338, were downregulated.Conclusion:In conclusion, these results can provide a potential research direction for further studies about the mechanisms of how miRNA affects malignant behavior in hepatocellular carcinoma.
