Purpose:Evaluation of technique effectiveness, patient safety and ablation parameters of MR-guided microwave ablation in hepatic malignancies using an MR-conditional high-power microwave ablation system.Materials and methods:Institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were obtained. Patients who underwent MR-guided microwave ablation of hepatic malignancies in a 1.5T wide-bore scanner using a perfusion-cooled high-power microwave ablation system with a maximum generator power of 150 W were included. Ablation parameters comprising procedure durations, net ablation duration, applicator positions and ablation zone dimensions were recorded. Adverse events were classified according to the CIRSE classification system. Technique effectiveness was assessed after 1 month. Follow-up was conducted with contrast-enhanced MRI and ranged from 1 to 20 months (mean: 6.1 ± 5.4 months).Results:Twenty-one consecutive patients (age: 63.4 ± 10.5 years; 5 female) underwent 22 procedures for 28 tumours (9 hepatocellular carcinomas, 19 metastases) with a mean tumour diameter of 14.6 ± 5.4 mm (range: 6-24 mm). Technique effectiveness was achieved in all lesions. Tumours were treated using 1.7 ± 0.7 applicator positions (range: 1-3). Mean energy and ablation duration per tumour were 75.3 ± 35.4 kJ and 13.3 ± 6.2 min, respectively. Coagulation zone short- and long-axis diameters were 29.1 ± 6.4 mm and 39.9 ± 7.4 mm, respectively. Average procedure duration was 146.4 ± 26.2 min (range: 98-187 min). One minor complication was reported. Five patients developed new tumour manifestations in the untreated liver. Local tumour progression was not observed during initial follow-up.Conclusion:MR-guided high-power microwave ablation provides safe and effective treatment of hepatic malignancies with short ablation times and within acceptable procedure durations.
