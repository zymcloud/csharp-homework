Background and aims:Gut microbiota is related with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the relationship between the gut microbiota and the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC remains unclear. We aimed to characterize gut microbiome in HBV-related HCC patients and estimate the clinical potential of gut microbiome as biomarkers for HBV-related HCC.Methods:We collected fecal and plasma samples from 20 health controls, 20 HBV-related cirrhosis and 20 HBV-related HCC in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. The fecal samples were subjected to the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA Miseq sequencing. Plasma samples were calculated for interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Then, we analyzed the correlation between the index and the gut microbiota.Results:We have found that the bacterial richness of the liver cirrhosis group was lower than the HCC group. The bacterial diversities were in consistent with IL-2. The pro-inflammatory bacteria (Veillonella, Escherichia-shigella) have increased in the liver cirrhosis group. The random forest model has achieved an area under the curve value was 94% with 95% CI, 88-100% between the HCC group and the non-HCC group. The results revealed that IL-2 was highly associated with the whole gut bacterial communities of HCC and liver cirrhosis groups. ALT, AST and glutamyl transpeptidase have strongly elevated in liver cirrhosis and HCC groups, which were associated with gut microbiome.Conclusions:It could be helpful to define the potential bacteria linking to pathological mechanisms of HBV-related HCC. The diagnosis potential of gut microbiome for early HBV-related HCC has been estimated.
