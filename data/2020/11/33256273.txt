With the advent of the era of artificial intelligence, radiomics is an emerging field in which high-throughput imaging data are extracted from different types of images to model and predict clinical prognosis in a non-invasive manner. Currently, this field is in its initial stage of development and lacks standardized assessment criteria, but still remains a promising tool for the future research direction. Radiomics analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma will aid in the early diagnosis, prognostic evaluation and treatment plan, thereby promoting the continuous improvement of clinical treatment strategies, and providing precise treatment methods to improve the survival rate and cure rate of patients. This article introduces the radiomics research process of hepatocellular carcinoma, and discusses its application progress, challenges and future development directions in the precise diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
