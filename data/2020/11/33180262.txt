Multidisciplinary treatment is recommended for the management of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Some operative decollateralization of extrahepatic feeding arteries with laparotomy have been introduced for HCC. We herein newly develop laparoscopic devascularization (LDEV) to continue transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for HCC with extrahepatic collateral arteries. A 74-year-old man with multiple huge HCC (4 tumors, 18 cm in diameter) and poor liver function (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, Child-Pugh score 7) was treated with 6 times of chemoembolization in combination with LDEV, 3 times of ablation therapies, and lenvatinib therapy. His tumor markers were triple positive (AFP, 12,906.5 ng/ml; PIVKA-II, 491,743 mAU/ml; AFP-L3, 91.8%) before treatments; however, they all returned to normal limits. Complete response was achieved according to the modified RECIST criteria. Unfortunately, he died 6 months after the final treatment with no recurrence of HCC due to the postoperative complication of primary lung cancer. LDEV is a useful tool to continue effective TACE, and multidisciplinary treatment including chemoembolization and LDEV can cure advanced HCC patients with extrahepatic collaterals and impaired liver function.
