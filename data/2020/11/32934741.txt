Transmembrane proteins are involved in the transportation of materials into and out of cells. The transmembrane protein (TMEM) family is a collection of poorly described transmembrane proteins that serve important roles in tumor development and progression. A number of TMEM proteins have been discovered. A newly discovered TMEM protein, TMEM206, transports ions across the membrane under physiological and pathological conditions, generating an acidic environment, which serves an important role in the microenvironment. However, the prognostic value and regulatory mechanisms of action of TMEM206 in tumors is unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value and regulation mechanisms of TMEM206 in tumors. Firstly, the expression of TMEM206 in tumors and normal tissues was assessed using the GEPIA and Oncomine databases and the results revealed that TMEM206 expression increased or decreased depending on the type of tumor. Subsequently, using the Human Protein Atlas and the Kaplan-Meier plotter, the findings of the present study revealed that TMEM206 is related to the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In order to explore the mechanism of TMEM206 in promoting tumor progression, GEO and cBioPortal were used to determine genes that may be co-expressed with TMEM206. MetaScape was used to identify the signaling pathways that TMEM206 may participate in. Finally, miRWalk, miRDB and TargetScan were used to identify miRNAs that may regulate the expression of TMEM206 and the findings revealed that 2 miRNA (hsa-miR-325 and hsa-miR-510-5p) were involved. In conclusion, upregulation of TMEM206 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
