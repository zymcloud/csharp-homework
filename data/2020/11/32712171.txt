Background:Kinetic modeling and control analysis of a metabolic pathway may identify the steps with the highest control in tumor cells, and low control in normal cells, which can be proposed as the best therapeutic targets.Methods:Enzyme kinetic characterization, pathway kinetic modeling and control analysis of the glucose central metabolism were carried out in rat (hepatoma AS-30D) and human (cervix HeLa) cancer cells and normal rat hepatocytes.Results:The glycogen metabolism enzymes in AS-30D, HeLa cells and hepatocytes showed similar kinetic properties, except for higher AS-30D glycogen phosphorylase (GP) sensitivity to AMP. Pathway modeling indicated that fluxes of glycogen degradation and PPP were mainly controlled by GP and NADPH consumption, respectively, in both hepatocytes and cancer cells. Likewise, hexose-6-phosphate isomerase (HPI) and phosphoglucomutase (PGM) exerted significant control on glycolysis and glycogen synthesis fluxes in cancer cells but not in hepatocytes. Modeling also indicated that glycolytic and glycogen synthesis fluxes could be strongly decreased when HPI and PGM were simultaneously inhibited in AS-30D cells but not in hepatocytes. Experimental assessment of these predictions showed that both the glycolytic and glycogen synthesis fluxes of AS-30D cells, but not of hepatocytes, were inhibited by oxamate, by inducing increased Fru1,6BP levels, a competitive inhibitor of HPI and PGM.Conclusion:HPI and PGM seem suitable targets for decreasing glycolytic and glycogen synthesis fluxes in AS-30D cells but not in hepatocytes.General significance:The present study identified new therapeutic targets within glucose central metabolism in the analyzed cancer cells, with no effects on non-cancer cells.
