Purpose:90Y-FF-21101 is an Yttrium-90-conjugated, chimeric mAb that is highly specific for binding to human placental (P)-cadherin, a cell-to-cell adhesion molecule overexpressed and associated with cancer invasion and metastatic dissemination in many cancer types. We report the clinical activity of 90Y-FF-21101 in a first-in-human phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors.Patients and methods:The safety and efficacy of 90Y-FF-21101 were evaluated in a phase I 3+3 dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors (n = 15) over a dose range of 5-25 mCi/m2. Dosimetry using 111In-FF-21101 was performed 1 week prior to assess radiation doses to critical organs. Patients who demonstrated clinical benefit received repeated 90Y-FF-21101 administration every 4 months.Results:111In-FF-21101 uptake was observed primarily in the spleen, kidneys, testes, lungs, and liver, with tumor uptake observed in the majority of patients. Organ dose estimates for all patients were below applicable limits. P-cadherin expression H-scores ranged from 0 to 242 with 40% of samples exhibiting scores ≥100. FF-21101 protein pharmacokinetics were linear with increasing antibody dose, and the mean half-life was 69.7 (±12.1) hours. Radioactivity clearance paralleled antibody clearance. A complete clinical response was observed in a patient with clear cell ovarian carcinoma, correlating with a high tumor P-cadherin expression. Stable disease was observed in a variety of other tumor types, without dose-limiting toxicity.Conclusions:The favorable safety profile and initial antitumor activity observed for 90Y-FF-21101 warrant further evaluation of this radioimmunotherapeutic (RIT) approach and provide initial clinical data supporting P-cadherin as a potential target for cancer treatment.
