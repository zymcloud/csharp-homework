In 2007, the first associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) procedure was performed in Regensburg, Germany. ALPPS is a variation of twostage hepatectomy to induce rapid liver hypertrophy allowing the removal of large tumors otherwise considered irresectable due to a too small future liver remnant. In 2012, the international ALPPS registry was created, and it now contains more than 1,000 cases. During the past years, improved patient selection and refinements in operative techniques, in particular, less invasive approaches such as Partial ALPPS, Tourniquet ALPPS, Ablation-assisted ALPPS, Hybrid ALPPS or Laparoscopic or Robotic approaches, have resulted in significant improvements in safety. The most frequent indication for ALPPS is colorectal liver metastases. In the first randomized controlled study, ALPPS provided a higher resectability rate than conventional two-stage hepatectomy, with similar complication rates. Long-term outcome data are still missing. The initial results of ALPPS for hepatocellular carcinoma and for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma were devastating, but with progress in surgical technic and better patient selection, ALPPS could serve as a treatment alternative in carefully selected cases, even for these tumors. ALPPS has enlarged the armamentarium of hepato-pancreato-biliary surgeons, but there is still discussion regarding how to use this novel technique, which may allow resection of tumors that are otherwise deemed irresectable.
