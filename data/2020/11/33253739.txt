Targeted therapy is an emerging treatment strategy for alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Inflammation plays an important role in the occurrence and development of ALD, and is a key choice for its targeted treatment, and anti-inflammatory treatment has been considered beneficial for liver disease. Surprisingly, immune checkpoint inhibitors have become important therapeutic agents for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, studies have shown that the combination of inflammatory molecule inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors can exert better effects than either alone in mouse models of HCC. This review discusses the mechanism of hepatic ethanol metabolism and the conditions under which inflammation occurs. In addition, we focus on the potential molecular targets in inflammatory signalling pathways and summarize the potential targeted inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, providing a theoretical basis for the targeted treatment of ALD and the development of new combination therapy strategies for HCC.
