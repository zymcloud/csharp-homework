Purpose To evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a combined single-step therapy in patients with unresectable single large (> 5 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with balloon-occluded microwave ablation (b-MWA) plus transcatheter arterial balloon-occluded chemoembolization (b-TACE).Materials & methods:Five consecutive Child A patients (mean age: 71.4 ± 3.2 yo; range 68-76 yo) with an unresectable single large HCC (> 5 cm) (mean size: 5.7 ± 0.6 cm; range 5.1-6.5 cm) were enrolled in our pilot study. The schedule consisted of percutaneous microwave ablation of the lesion during balloon occlusion of the hepatic artery supplying the tumor (b-MWA), followed by TACE under the occlusion of feeding arteries by a microballoon catheter (b-TACE). Adverse events and intra- and peri-procedural complications were clinically assessed. Early local efficacy was evaluated on 1- and 6-month follow-up multiphasic computed tomography (CT) on the basis of m-RECIST criteria.Results:Technical success was obtained in all procedures. No major complications occurred. A mean necrotic area of 6.8 ± 0.47 cm (range 6.3-7.4 cm) was obtained, with a complete response at 1-month follow-up obtained in 4 out of 5 lesions, with 1 partial response (less than 30% of residual tumor), successfully treated with a single TACE treatment. No residual tumor or local recurrence was registered at 6-month CT follow-up.Conclusions:Our preliminary experience seems to demonstrate that b-MWA plus b-TACE could be a safe and effective combined therapy for unresectable large HCC lesions, allowing a high rate of local response also in lesion exceeding 5 cm in size.
