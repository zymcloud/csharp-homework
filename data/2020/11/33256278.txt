Objective: To study the miR-100 expression levels in the tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and to further explore the correlation between miR-100 and the invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and its effect on patients' prognostic survival. Methods: Clinicopathological data of 70 cases that underwent hepatectomy from December 2013 to December 2016 in the Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery of Henan Provincial People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR was used to detect the different miR-100 expression levels in cancerous and adjacent tissues. The expression of miR-100 with different clinicopathological features was compared, and the prognostic factors of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were comprehensively analyzed. The correlation between miR-100 and patients' clinicopathological features was tested by χ(2). Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw the survival curve. Log-rank test was used to examine the survival rate difference in each subgroup. Cox regression model was used to analyze the multivariate prognosis. Results: miR-100 expression was down-regulated to a different degree in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues than the corresponding adjacent tissues. Among them, the down-regulated expression of miR-100 in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues accounted for 82.9% (58/70, P < 0.05) of all cases when compared to corresponding paracancerous tissues. miR-100 expression level was significantly correlated to high Edmondson's grade, high TNM stage and intrahepatic metastasis (P < 0.05). The overall survival time of miR-100 positive expression was significantly higher than that of miR-100 negative expression (Log-rank χ(2) = 8.257, P < 0.05). Univariate survival analysis results revealed that the miR-100 expression level, tumor size, TNM stage, Edmondson's grade, and presence or absence of venous tumor thrombosis had a poor prognosis (P < 0.05). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that the tumor size, Edmondson's grade, and miR-100 expression level were independent factors affecting the prognostic survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. In addition, patients with low positive expression rate of miR-100, large tumors and high Edmondson's grade had a poor prognosis. Conclusion: The level of miR-100 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells is low, so it is closely related to the invasion and metastasis and affects the prognostic survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
