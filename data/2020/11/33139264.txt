On May 29, 2020, the FDA approved atezolizumab for use in combination with bevacizumab, for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with no prior systemic treatment. The approval was based on data from Study IMbrave150, which randomly allocated (2:1) patients to receive either atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (atezolizumab-bevacizumab) or sorafenib. Overall survival (OS) and independently-assessed progression free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population were the primary endpoints. At the time of the primary analysis, the estimated median OS could not be estimated in the atezolizumab-bevacizumab arm and was 13.2 months in the sorafenib arm (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.58; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.42, 0.79). The estimated median PFS was 6.8 months (95% CI: 5.8, 8.3) and 4.3 months (95% CI: 4.0, 5.6) in the atezolizumab-bevacizumab and sorafenib arms, respectively. Adverse reactions occurring in >20% of patients receiving atezolizumab-bevacizumab were hypertension, fatigue/asthenia, and proteinuria. Adverse reactions occurring in >20% of patients receiving sorafenib were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, diarrhea, hypertension, and decreased appetite. Hemorrhage was reported more frequently in patients receiving atezolizumab-bevacizumab (25%) than in patients receiving sorafenib (17%). An evaluation for the presence of varices is recommended within 6 months of initiation of atezolizumab-bevacizumab in patients with HCC. Approval of atezolizumab-bevacizumab is likely to change the treatment paradigm for HCC given that treatment with atezolizumab-bevacizumab resulted in improved OS and PFS compared to sorafenib, an accepted standard of care for first-line treatment of patients with unresectable HCC.
