Background:In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), detection and treatment prior to growth beyond 2 cm are relevant as a larger tumor size is more frequently associated with microvascular invasion and/or satellites.Aim:To examine the impact of the tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or PIVKA-II in detecting very small HCC nodules (≤ 2 cm in maximum diameter, Barcelona stage 0) in the large number of very small HCC. The difference in the behavior of these tumor markers in HCC development was also examined.Methods:A total of 933 patients with single-nodule HCC were examined. They were subdivided into 394 patients with HCC nodules ≤ 2 cm in maximum diameter and 539 patients whose nodules were > 2 cm. The rates of patients whose AFP and PIVKA-II showed normal values were examined.Results:The positive ratio of the marker PIVKA-II was significantly different (P < 0.0001) between patients with nodules ≤ 2 cm in diameter and those with nodules > 2 cm, but there was no significant difference in AFP (P = 0.4254). In the patients whose tumor was ≤ 2 cm, 50.5% showed normal levels in AFP and 68.8% showed normal levels in PIVKA-II. In 36.4% of those patients, both AFP and PIVKA-II showed normal levels. The PIVKA-II-positive ratio was markedly increased with an increase in the tumor size. In contrast, the positivity in AFP was increased gradually and slowly.Conclusion:In the surveillance of very small HCC nodules (≤ 2 cm in diameter, Barcelona clinical stage 0) the tumor markers AFP and PIVKA-II are not so useful.
