Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most active monomer in green tea (GT), has demonstrated potential therapeutic and preventive effects on various tumors, including liver cancer. However, the anticancer mechanisms of EGCG in liver cancer remain to be elucidated. The abnormal expression of cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) has been identified in liver cancer and is closely associated with malignancy and poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study used human hepatoma cell lines and rats with diethylnitrosamine (DEN)‑induced HCC as models to investigate the association between the effect of EGCG on liver cancer and regulation of the p21waf1/Cip1/CDC25A axis. The results demonstrated that EGCG can inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 and Huh7 cells, reduce the expression of CDC25A and increase the expression of p21waf1/Cip1 in HepG2. In vivo, HCC was induced by DEN in Sprague‑Dawley rats. EGCG significantly reduced tumor volume and improved the survival rates of rats with HCC. The expression levels of CDC25A mRNA and protein in liver tissues and the level of serum γ glutamyl transpeptidase in rats treated with EGCG were significantly decreased, while p21waf1/Cip1 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased compared with the HCC group, in the process of DEN‑induced HCC. No significant difference in the chemopreventive effects on liver cancer was observed between GT extract and EGCG under an EGCG equivalence condition. Thus, EGCG can suppress human hepatoma cell proliferation and prolong the survival of rats with HCC, and the potential mechanism may be involved in EGCG‑induced upregulation of p21waf1/Cip1 and downregulation of CDC25A.
