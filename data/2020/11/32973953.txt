The long non-coding (lnc)RNA associated with poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (AWPPH) serves as an oncogene in several cancers, such as liver and bladder cancers, however, to the best of our knowledge, its function in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is unknown. The results of the present study revealed that the expression levels of lncRNA AWPPH and Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) were upregulated in the bone marrow of patients with pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared with healthy controls. Expression levels of lncRNA AWPPH and ROCK2 were positively correlated with each other. lncRNA AWPPH and ROCK2 overexpression promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of Loucy cells, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Overexpression of lncRNA AWPPH resulted in upregulation of ROCK2 expression in Loucy cells. Similarly, ROCK2 overexpression also resulted in upregulation of lncRNA AWPPH in Loucy cells, suggesting an element of reciprocity in the function of lncRNA AWPPH and ROCK2. It was concluded that lncRNA AWPPH promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of cancer cells in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia possibly through interactions with ROCK2.
