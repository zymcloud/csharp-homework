With the increasing use of cross-sectional imaging, the detection of incidental liver lesions has become more common. Accurate and reliable characterisation of these is vital for optimal patient care. Owing to the great improvements in medical imaging technology in recent years, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, it is now possible to characterise a significant proportion of these non-invasively. This is of paramount importance in improving patient safety and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary biopsies. This article gives a synopsis of the different imaging modalities for liver. It depicts the salient imaging features of the common benign and malignant focal liver lesions on different imaging modalities, with emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging. It demonstrates the pseudolesions, variants, mimics and pitfalls that occur in liver imaging. The tailored magnetic resonance imaging protocols including abbreviated ones, the contrast agents and the pathway for managing incidental liver lesions in the author's institution are covered.
