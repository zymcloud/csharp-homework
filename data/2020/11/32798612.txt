Benfluralin, an herbicide of the dinitroaniline class used in weed control, was first registered in the United States in 1970. Increased incidence of liver tumors was observed in the 2 year dietary carcinogenicity studies. A review of the toxicology database provides evidence that the mode of action (MOA) of benfluralin responsible for hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma in rodents depends on activation of the constitutive androstane (CAR)/pregnane X (PXR) receptors, that triggers enzyme induction and altered gene expression leading to hepatocyte proliferation. After prolonged exposures at high dose levels, altered hepatic foci and liver tumors are observed. This hepatocarcinogenic MOA has been described in rodents following long-term dietary exposures to other CAR/PXR activator chemicals, such as phenobarbital, and is generally considered as non-relevant in humans due to differences between human and rodent responses. We analyzed the existing and newly acquired toxicology data to establish that the hepatocarcinogenic MOA of benfluralin in rodents includes the same key events previously described in the rodent MOA of phenobarbital. A weight of evidence approach was taken to establish temporal and dose-related concordance of the causal key events supporting the conclusion that rodent liver carcinogenicity of benfluralin is unlikely to be relevant for human cancer risk.
