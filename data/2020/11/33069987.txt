Purpose:To analyze the correlation between enhancement patterns of small hepatic carcinomas (HCCs; â‰¤ 30 mm) on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and the clinicopathologic characteristics.Methods:The retrospective study included 346 inpatients (288 males and 58 females) with 372 pathologically confirmed small HCCs between January 2017 and December 2018. All patients underwent CEUS examination before pathological examination. Statistical analysis was used to determine the correlation between enhancement patterns of small HCCs on CEUS and clinicopathologic characteristics including serum alpha-feto-protein level, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) level, primary or recurrent HCC condition, tumor number, tumor differentiation, tumor size, liver background and microvascular invasion (MVI).Results:Three hundred forty-seven out of 372 (93.3 %) HCCs manifested arterial phase hyper-enhancement (APHE). The arterial enhancement patterns were correlated with the tumor differentiation (odds ratio = 10.336, P = 0.000). Moderately- or poorly-differentiated HCCs were more likely to display APHE than well-differentiated HCCs (96.2 % vs 58.6 %, P Conclusions:Enhancement patterns of small HCCs on CEUS were significantly correlated with tumor size and tumor differentiation among all clinicopathologic characteristics.
