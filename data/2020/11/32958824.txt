Background:The liver is the central organ for cholesterol homoeostasis, and its dysfunction might cause liver pathological alterations including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ24 reductase (DHCR24), a crucial enzyme of cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, is involved in lipid rafts formation. Genkwadaphnin (GD) is a daphnane diterpene isolated from the flower buds of Daphne genkwa Siebold et Zuccarini (Thymelaeaceae).Methods:We evaluated in vitro and in vivo effect of GD using HCC cells and BALB/c nude mice. Microarray assays were used to identify the differential genes by GD. DHCR24 expression and activity, cholesterol level, lipid rafts structure and the role of DHCR24 in human HCC specimens were tested by various molecular biology techniques.Results:High expression of DHCR24 in human HCC specimens was correlated with poor clinical outcome. Interfering DHCR24 altered growth and migration of HCC cells. GD inhibited growth and metastasis of HCC cells both in vivo and in vitro. GD suppressed DHCR24 expression and activity, as well as DHCR24-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid rafts formation, then further inhibited HCC cell invasion and migration.Conclusions:Our data suggest that DHCR24-mediated cholesterol metabolism might be an effective therapeutic strategy in HCC, and natural product GD might be a promising agent for HCC therapy.
