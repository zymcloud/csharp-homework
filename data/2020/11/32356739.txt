In this project, our goal is to develop a method for interpreting how a neural network makes layer-by-layer embedded decisions when trained for a classification task, and also to use this insight for improving the model performance. To do this, we first approximate the distribution of the image representations in these embeddings using random forest models, the output of which, termed embedding outputs, are used for measuring how the network classifies each sample. Next, we design a pipeline to use this layer embedding output to calibrate the original model output for improved probability calibration and classification. We apply this two-steps method in a fully convolutional neural network trained for a liver tissue classification task on our institutional dataset that contains 20 3D multi-parameter MR images for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as on a public dataset with 131 3D CT images. The results show that our method is not only able to provide visualizations that are easy to interpret, but that the embedded decision-based information is also useful for improving model performance in terms of probability calibration and classification, achieving the best performance compared to other baseline methods. Moreover, this method is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and robust to hyper-parameters.
