Background:For patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastasis, either a simultaneous, or a two-staged resection of the primary tumor and the liver metastases is possible. There are currently no guidelines preferring one approach to the other.Material and methods:Consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection at our university hospital from 2007-2016 were included. Clinical, histopathologic, serologic, and survival data were analyzed. The primary end point was tumor-specific survival for patients with simultaneous versus staged resections.Results:Of all 140 patients, 68 underwent simultaneous resection and 72 underwent staged resection. The characteristics of both groups were comparable. Patients with simultaneous resections had a shorter duration of cumulative operation time (299 versus 460 min; P = 0.003) and a shorter cumulative length of hospital stay (23 versus 43 d; P = 0.002). Perioperative mortality (P = 0.257) did not differ significantly; however, patients with simultaneous resections had higher rates of grade 2 complications according to Clavien-Dindo (P < 0.001). Tumor-specific 1-y survival was 85 ± 5% for simultaneous and 83 ± 5% for staged resection (P = 0.631). On multivariable analysis, pT4 (P = 0.038), pN3 (P = 0.003), and G3/4 (P = 0.041) of the primary tumor and postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo 3/4/5, P = 0.003) were poor prognostic factors regarding tumor-specific survival.Conclusions:This is one of the largest and most thoroughly documented retrospective single-center studies of consecutive patients with synchronous hepatic metastases. Simultaneous resection of colorectal cancer together with hepatic metastases is a safe procedure in selected patients and does not have a significant influence on long-term survival.
