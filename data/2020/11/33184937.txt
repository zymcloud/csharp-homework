Background and aim:Significant human and material resources have been diverted to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Healthcare workers are at high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gastroenterology and hepatology departments and specialists in Spain.Methods:This study involves a nationwide survey addressing the impact of COVID-19 on resources, procedures, and physicians of gastroenterology and hepatology departments in 81 hospitals representative of the Spanish National Health Service.Results:Overall, 41.8% of hospital beds and 40.7% of gastroenterology and hepatology beds were allocated to COVID-19 patient care, as well as 24.8% of gastroenterologists and 58.3% of residents. Outpatient visits, abdominal ultrasounds, and endoscopies were reduced by 81.8-91.9%. Nine large university hospitals had 75% and 89% reductions in therapeutic endoscopies and hepatocellular carcinoma surgery, respectively, with cancelation of elective liver transplant and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Prevalence of infected physicians was 10.6% and was dependent on regional population incidence (r = 0.74, P = 0.001), with 11% hospitalized and one physician dying. Up to 63.4% of physicians may have been infected before or shortly after Spain entered lockdown, 57% of them having recently performed endoscopies. Adequate protection was acknowledged in > 80% hospitals, but only 2.9% performed regular SARS-CoV-2 testing.Conclusions:The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery has been massive. A wave of gastroenterology-related complications is expected because of resource diversion. Gastroenterologists have a high prevalence of infection, although they may have been infected during a first phase of lower awareness and protection. Regular SARS-CoV-2 screening, adequate protection, and quick reorganization of healthcare resources are still needed.
