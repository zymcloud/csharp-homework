The Melanoma Antigen Gene (MAGE) family is a large, highly conserved group of proteins which was reported to participate in the progression of multiple cancers in humans. However, the function of distinct MAGE genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unclear. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the expression, clinical significance, genetic alteration, interaction network and functional enrichment of MAGEs in HCC. Our research showed that many MAGE genes were dysregulated in HCC. Among them, MAGEA1, MAGEC2, MAGED1, MAGED2, MAGEF1 and MAGEL2 were significantly associated with clinical stage and differentiation of HCC. MAGED1, MAGED2, MAGEA6, MAGEA12, MAGEA10, MAGEB4, MAGEL2 and MAGEC3 significantly correlated with HCC prognosis. Further functional enrichment analysis suggested the dysregulated MAGEs may play important roles in signal transduction. These results indicate that multiple dysregulated MAGEs might play important roles in the development of HCC and can be exploited as useful biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment in HCC.
