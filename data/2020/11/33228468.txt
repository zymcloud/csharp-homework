In the present study, a new bacterial strain, Bacillus halotolerans OHEM18 was significantly found to produce extracellular L-asparaginase. L-asparaginase was purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation and QFF column to 3.84-fold with specific activity of 215.33 U/mg and its molecular mass was assessed to be 41.5 kDa. Maximum enzyme activity was determined at pH 8.2 and 40 °C and with retaining 70% of its activity after incubation for 1 h at 50 °C. Km and Vmax values were determined to be 0.0047 M and 92.74, respectively. Cytotoxicity test indicated a significant safety of L-asparaginase on Vero cells with selectivity against leukemia, breast cancer and hepatoma cells. NFS-60 cells was the most sensitive tumor cells to L-asparaginase with IC50 of 10.29 µg/ml and selectivity index of 30.61. This selectivity was recognized to be an apoptosis-dependent mechanism proven via cell cycle arrest in sub-G1 phase and fragmentation of genomic DNA. L-asparaginase showed antioxidant activity against both DPPH and ABTS radicals with IC50 values of 64.07 and 177.1 mg/ml, respectively. These competitive advantage of bacterial L-asparaginase over than other sources is that it might be produced in large amounts through production in large-scale biofermenters, which decreases costs, besides having a sustainable bacterial source. Our findings established that the potent cytotoxic effect of L-asparaginase isolated from B. halotolerans OHEM18 may be a promise candidate for further medicinal applications as an antioxidant and antitumor drug.
