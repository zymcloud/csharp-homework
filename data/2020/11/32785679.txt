Context:Patients with hypopituitarism face excess mortality in the long-term outpatient setting. However, associations of pituitary dysfunction with outcomes in acutely hospitalized patients are lacking.Objective:The objective of this work is to assess clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with hypopituitarism with or without diabetes insipidus (DI).Design, setting, and patients:In this population-based, matched-cohort study from 2012 to 2017, hospitalized adult patients with a history of hypopituitarism were 1:1 propensity score-matched with a general medical inpatient cohort.Main outcome measures:The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included all-cause readmission rates within 30 days and 1 year, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates, and length of hospital stay.Results:After matching, 6764 cases were included in the study. In total, 3382 patients had hypopituitarism and of those 807 (24%) suffered from DI. All-cause in-hospital mortality occurred in 198 (5.9%) of patients with hypopituitarism and in 164 (4.9%) of matched controls (odds ratio [OR] 1.32, [95% CI, 1.06-1.65], P = .013). Increased mortality was primarily observed in patients with DI (OR 3.69 [95% CI, 2.44-5.58], P < .001). Patients with hypopituitarism had higher ICU admissions (OR 1.50 [95% CI, 1.30-1.74], P < .001), and faced a 2.4-day prolonged length of hospitalization (95% CI, 1.94-2.95, P < .001) compared to matched controls. Risk of 30-day (OR 1.31 [95% CI, 1.13-1.51], P < .001) and 1-year readmission (OR 1.29 [95% CI, 1.17-1.42], P < .001) was higher among patients with hypopituitarism as compared with medical controls.Conclusions:Patients with hypopituitarism are highly vulnerable once hospitalized for acute medical conditions with increased risk of mortality and adverse clinical outcomes. This was most pronounced among those with DI.
