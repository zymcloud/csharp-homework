6,8-Diprenylorobol is a phytochemical derived from the roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. 6,8-Diprenylorobol exhibits several biological activities, but the effects of 6,8-diprenylorobol on cancers have been hardly investigated. This study is aimed at elucidating the anticancer effect and working mechanism of 6,8-diprenylorobol in HepG2 and Huh-7, two kinds of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. WST-1, cell counting, and colony formation assays and morphological change analysis showed that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment decreased the cell viability and proliferation rate. Cell cycle analysis indicated that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment increased the population of the G1/0 stage. Annexin V/PI double staining and TUNEL analysis showed that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment increased the apoptotic cell population and DNA fragmentation. Western blot analysis showed that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment increased the expression of cleaved PARP1, cleaved caspase-3, FOXO3, Bax, Bim, p21, and p27 but decreased the expression of Bcl2 and BclXL. Interestingly, 6,8-diprenylorobol inhibited CYP2J2-mediated astemizole O-demethylation and ebastine hydroxylase activities with K i values of 9.46 and 2.61 Î¼M, respectively. CYP2J2 siRNA transfection enhanced the anticancer effect of 6,8-diprenylorobol in HepG2 and Huh-7 cells through the downregulation of CYP2J2 protein expression and upregulation of FOXO3. Taken together, this study proposes that 6,8-diprenylorobol treatment may be a useful therapeutic option against HCC by targeting CYP2J2 and FOXO3.
