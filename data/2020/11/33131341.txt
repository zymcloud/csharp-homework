Background: Stem cells play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, their precise effect on HCC tumorigenesis and progression remains unclear. The present study aimed to characterize stem cell-related gene expression in HCC. Methods: The mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) was used to analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of HCC patients. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to construct a gene co-expression network of 374 HCC patients. Finally, six genes were used to construct the prognosis signature. Results: HCC patients had a higher mRNAsi score than healthy people, suggesting poor prognosis. Two gene modules highly related to mRNAsi were identified. Multivariate Cox analysis was carried out to establish a Cox proportional risk regression model. The risk score for each patient was the sum of the product of each gene expression and its coefficient. Survival analysis suggested that the low-risk group had a significantly better prognosis. Conclusions: The established six-gene signature was able to predict patient prognosis accurately. This new signature should be verified in prospective studies in order to determine patient prognosis in clinical decision-making.
