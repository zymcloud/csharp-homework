RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the most promising methods for the treatment of malignant tumors. However, developing an efficient biocompatible delivery vector for small interfering RNA (siRNA) remains a challenging issue. This study aimed to prepare a non-viral tumor-targeted carrier, named RGDfC-modified functionalized selenium nanoparticles (RGDfC-SeNPs). RGDfC-SeNPs were used to selectively deliver siSox2 to HepG2 liver cancer cells and tissues for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the current study, RGDfC-SeNPs were successfully synthesized and characterized. It was shown that RGDfC-SeNPs could effectively load siSox2 to prepare an antitumor prodrug RGDfC-Se@siSox2. RGDfC-Se@siSox2 exhibited selective uptake in HepG2 liver cancer cells and LO2 normal liver cells, indicating RGDfC-SeNPs could effectively deliver siSox2 to HepG2 liver cancer cells. RGDfC-Se@siSox2 entered HepG2 cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis by firstly encircling the cytoplasm and then releasing siSox2 in the lysosomes. RGDfC-Se@siSox2 could effectively silence Sox2 and inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2 cells. RGDfC-Se@siSox2 induced HepG2 cells apoptosis most likely via overproduction of reactive oxygen species and disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potentials. Most importantly, RGDfC-Se@siSox2 significantly inhibited the tumor growth in HepG2 tumor-bearing mice without obvious toxic side effects. These studies indicated that RGDfC-SeNPs may be an ideal gene carrier for delivering siSox2 to HepG2 cells and that RGDfC-Se@siSox2 may be a novel and highly specific gene-targeted prodrug therapy for HCC.
