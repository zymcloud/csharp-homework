Simultaneous positron emission tomography and MRI (PET/MRI) is an emerging technology that offers the benefits of MRI, including excellent soft tissue contrast, lack of ionizing radiation, and functional MRI techniques, with the physiologic information provided by PET. Although most PET/MRI systems are currently installed in tertiary care centers, PET/MRI technology is becoming increasingly widespread. The usefulness of PET/MRI varies by tumor type and organ system and has been shown to have utility in evaluation of primary and secondary hepatic neoplasms. Understanding the appropriate applications, techniques and relevant imaging findings is important for practicing radiologists considering or currently utilizing PET/MR for the evaluation of primary liver neoplasms, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as staging of biliary neoplasms including cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, identification of liver metastases, and staging of neuroendocrine tumor.
