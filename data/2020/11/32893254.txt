Blood loss is associated with the degree of damage in liver stiffness. Severe liver steatosis is a matter of concern in liver surgery, but does not correlate with liver stiffness. This study aimed to assess the relationship between blood perfusion of the liver and blood loss in liver pathologies. Data from elective liver resection for liver cancer were analyzed. All patients underwent preoperative assessments including perfusion CT. Patients were divided into 4 groups in accordance with the pathological background of liver parenchyma. Relationships between portal flow as assessed by perfusion CT and perioperative variables were compared. Factors correlating with blood loss were analyzed. In 166 patients, portal flow from perfusion CT correlated positively with platelet count and negatively with indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min. Background liver pathology was normal liver (NL) in 43 cases, chronic hepatitis (CH) in 56, liver cirrhosis (LC) in 42, and liver steatosis (LS) in 25. Rates of hepatitis viral infection and pathological hepatocellular carcinoma were more frequent in LC and CH groups than in the other groups (p
