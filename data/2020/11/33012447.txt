Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a morphologically heterogeneous tumor with variable architectural growth patterns and several distinct histologic subtypes. Large-scale attempts have been made over the past decade to identify targetable genomic alterations in HCC; however, its translation into clinical personalized care remains a challenge to precision oncology. The role of pathology is no longer limited to confirmation of diagnosis when radiologic features are atypical. Pathology is now in a position to predict the underlying molecular alteration, prognosis, and behavior of HCC. This review outlines various aspects of histopathologic diagnosis and role of pathology in cutting-edge diagnostics of HCC.
