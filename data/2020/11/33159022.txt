N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation is the most prevalent modification of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and catalyzed by a multicomponent methyltransferase complex (MTC), among which methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and METTL14 are two core molecules. However, METTL3 and METTL14 play opposite regulatory roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we conducted a multi-omics analysis of METTL3 and METTL14 in HCC, including RNA-sequencing, m6ARIP-sequencing, and ribosome-sequencing profiles. We found that the expression and prognostic value of METTL3 and METTL14 are opposite in HCC. Besides, after METTL3 and METTL14 knockdown, most of the dysregulated mRNAs, signaling pathways and biological processes are distinct in HCC, which partly explains the contrary regulatory role of METTL3 and METTL14. Intriguingly, these mRNAs whose stability or translation efficiency are influenced by METTL3 or METTL14 in an m6A dependent manner, jointly regulate multiple signaling pathways and biological processes, which supports the cooperative role of METTL3 and METTL14 in catalyzing m6A modification. In conclusion, our study further clarified the contradictory role of METTL3 and METTL14 in HCC.
