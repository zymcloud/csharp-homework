Background and aims:Diabetes has been reported as a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in population based studies but there are controversial data in patients with cirrhosis. Otherwise, metformin could have a protective role in HCC development. The aim of this study was to know the influence of diabetes on the risk of developing HCC in patients with alcohol- and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis.Methods:We analyzed 982 Caucasian patients with alcoholic or HCV cirrhosis included from 1992 to 2014 in a HCC surveillance program and prospectively followed. The influence of diabetes on the development of HCC was analyzed by Kaplan-Meyer and adjusted with Cox regression for relevant co-factors.Results:At a median follow-up of 49.5 (24.0-96.0) months, 156 patients (15.8%) developed HCC. There were no differences in the cumulative incidences of HCC after 20 years between diabetic and non-diabetic patients in the global series (53.5% vs. 45.4%; P=0.26), alcoholic (50.4% vs. 45.4%; P=0.21) or HCV (60% vs. 43.1%; P=0.57) cirrhosis. After adjusting for other potential co-factors, diabetes did not constitute a risk factor neither in the whole series (HR: 1.12, 95% IC: 0.78-1.51; P=0.26) nor in alcoholic (HR: 1.160, 95% CI: 0.74-1.82; P=0.50) or HCV cirrhosis (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.63-2.19; P=0.60). These figures did not change after excluding patients treated with metformin.Conclusions:In Caucasian patients with alcoholic or HCV cirrhosis, diabetes is not a risk factor for developing HCC. This lack of association does not seem to be consequence of the protective effect of metformin.
