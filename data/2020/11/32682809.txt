The cysteinyl aspartate protease (caspase, or CASP) gene family plays a significant role in programmed cell death, inflammation and immunity. However, the correlation between CASP family members and prognosis and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in different tumors has not been determined. We investigated the role of CASP genes in cancer prognosis and their relationship with clinicopathological parameters. We also evaluated the correlation between the expression of CASP family members and cancer immune infiltration and evaluated whether these molecules can be used as targets for immunotherapy. The CASP1/2/4/5/7/9 genes may represent prognostic factors and therapeutic targets for breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Another finding is that the CASP1/4/5 genes help to regulate innate immunity and T cell immunity and may also have an important effect on tumor checkpoint inhibition. These findings may elucidate the roles played by CASP family members in cancer progression and identify strategies to promote collaborative activities in the context of immunotherapy.
