Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumor thrombus in the bile duct (BDTT) is easily misdiagnosed or mistreated due to the clinicopathological diversity of the thrombus and its relationship with primary lesions.Aim:To propose a new classification for HCC with BDTT in order to guide its diagnosis and treatment.Methods:A retrospective review of the diagnosis and treatment experience regarding seven typical HCC patients with BDTT between January 2010 and December 2019 was conducted.Results:BDTT was preoperatively confirmed by computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging in only four patients. Three patients with recurrent HCC and one patient with first-occurring HCC had no visible intrahepatic tumors; of these, misdiagnosis occurred in two patients, and three patients died. One patient was mistreated as having common bile duct stones, and another patient with a history of multiple recurrent HCC was misdiagnosed until obvious biliary dilation could be detected. Only one patient who received hepatectomy accompanied by BDTT extraction exhibited disease-free survival during the follow-up period. A new classification was proposed for HCC with BDTT as follows: HCC with microscopic BDTT (Type I); resectable primary or recurrent HCC mass in the liver with BDTT (Type II); BDTT without an obvious HCC mass in the liver (Type III) and BDTT accompanied with unresectable intra- or extrahepatic HCC lesions (Type IV).Conclusion:We herein propose a new classification system for HCC with BDTT to reflect its pathological characteristics and emphasize the significance of primary tumor resectability in its treatment.
