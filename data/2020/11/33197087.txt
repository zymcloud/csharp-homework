Aim:Sequential administration of sorafenib followed by regorafenib or lenvatinib is effective against advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we compared the safety profiles and anti-tumor effects of sequential sorafenib and regorafenib or lenvatinib therapy in patients with HCC.Methods:We investigated adverse events, treatment responses and dose intensities in patients with HCC who were consecutively treated with sorafenib followed by regorafenib or lenvatinib at the individual level.Results:Each group included 20 patients. The safety profiles of regorafenib and sorafenib were similar. The severity of hypophosphatemia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and decreased neutrophil counts associated with regorafenib or sorafenib was similar in 12 patients. Conversely, the incidences and grades of adverse events differed between sorafenib and lenvatinib treatment. The anti-tumor effects of regorafenib and lenvatinib compared with sorafenib were significantly different for each patient. The response to treatment and progression-free survival were comparable for regorafenib and lenvatinib. The median relative dose intensities during the first 56 days of regorafenib and lenvatinib treatment were 83.6 and 80.0%, respectively.Conclusions:Similar adverse events were experienced by patients during consecutive treatment with sorafenib and regorafenib, which was not observed during treatment with sorafenib and lenvatinib. The obtained safety profile of sorafenib provided meaningful insights for selecting sequential therapy for patients with advanced HCC.
