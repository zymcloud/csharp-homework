Aim:To assess the utility of the perioperative use of direct oral anticoagulants for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cancer-associated thrombosis.Case report:An 83-year-old woman was admitted with a solitary HCC (10-cm diameter), as well as with multiple sites of venous thromboembolism and macroscopic portal vein tumor thrombosis. She had appropriate liver function without viral hepatitis, triple-positive tumor markers, and secondary polycythemia. Edoxaban at 30 mg was initiated 10 days before surgery to remove HCC. Complete remission of the pulmonary embolism and stability of the deep vein thrombosis and massive superior mesenteric vein thrombosis were recognized preoperatively. An extended left hepatectomy was successfully performed. To avoid hemorrhage complications, we used intravenous administration of nafamostat mesylate for 2 days, thereafter we restarted edoxaban. Superior mesenteric vein thrombosis resolved 5 months after surgery.Conclusion:Perioperative oral administration of edoxaban was useful in multidisciplinary treatment for a patient with advanced HCC with cancer-associated thrombosis.
