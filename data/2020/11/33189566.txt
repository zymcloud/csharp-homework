Background:We assessed if the risk of post-liver transplant mortality within 24 h could be stratified at the time of listing using the liver transplant risk score (LTRS). Secondary aims were to assess if the LTRS could stratify the risk of 30-day, 1-year mortality, and survival beyond the first year.Methods:MELD, BMI, age, diabetes, and the need for dialysis were the five variables used to calculate the LTRS during patients' evaluation for liver transplantation. Mortality rates at 24 h, 30 days, and 1-year were compared among groups of patients with different LTRS. Patients with ABO-incompatibility, redo, multivisceral, partial graft and malignancies except for hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Data of 48,616 adult liver transplant recipients were extracted from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients between 2002 and 2017.Results:24-h mortality was 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.7%, 2.3%, 2.0% and 3.5% for patients with LTRS of 0,1,2,3,4, 5 and â‰¥ 6, respectively (P Conclusion:Perioperative mortality and long-term survival of patients undergoing LT can be accurately estimated at the time of listing by the LTRS.
