Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world, with the second highest mortality rate among all cancer types. Growing evidence has demonstrated the notable effects of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and tumor immune microenvironment heterogeneity (TIMH) on the biological processes involved in HCC. However, the interactive mechanisms between ITH and TIMH is still unclear. The present study systematically screened the mRNA expression, simple nucleotide variation data and clinical data of samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) score was used to represent ITH, and TCGA cohort was divided into two groups according to the MATH score. Next, different immune-related signaling pathways and enriched immune-related genes were identified using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of these two groups, and the results revealed that interleukin-1α (IL1A) and serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK4 were associated with prognosis. Furthermore, CIBERSORT was utilized to calculate the fractions of 22 types of leukocytes to represent TIMH, and the fractions of M1 and M2 macrophages were confirmed to be associated with prognosis. Therefore, PAK4, interleukin-1α (IL1A), and M1/M2 ratio were selected as the key factors involved in the interaction between ITH and TIMH. Afterwards, microRNAs (miRNAs) that were linearly related to the M1/M2 ratio and the potential target genes of the miRNAs were screened. Finally, the regulatory network between PAK4, IL1A, and the M1/M2 ratio was established, bridged by the above miRNAs and the target genes. In addition, PAK4, heat shock protein 105 kDa and miRNA-1911 were demonstrated to be a key factor involved in immune response via Weighted Correlation Network Analysis in HCC.
