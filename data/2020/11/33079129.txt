The Na+-coupled citrate transporter (NaCT/SLC13A5/mINDY) in the liver delivers citrate from the blood into hepatocytes. As citrate is a key metabolite and regulator of multiple biochemical pathways, deletion of Slc13a5 in mice protects against diet-induced obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Silencing the transporter suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, selective blockers of NaCT hold the potential to treat various diseases. Here we report on the characteristics of one such inhibitor, BI01383298. It is known that BI01383298 is a high-affinity inhibitor selective for human NaCT with no effect on mouse NaCT. Here we show that this compound is an irreversible and non-competitive inhibitor of human NaCT, thus describing the first irreversible inhibitor for this transporter. The mouse NaCT is not affected by this compound. The inhibition of human NaCT by BI01383298 is evident for the constitutively expressed transporter in HepG2 cells and for the ectopically expressed human NaCT in HEK293 cells. The IC50 is âˆ¼100 nM, representing the highest potency among the NaCT inhibitors known to date. Exposure of HepG2 cells to this inhibitor results in decreased cell proliferation. We performed molecular modeling of the 3D-structures of human and mouse NaCTs using the crystal structure of a humanized variant of VcINDY as the template, and docking studies to identify the amino acid residues involved in the binding of citrate and BI01383298. These studies provide insight into the probable bases for the differential effects of the inhibitor on human NaCT versus mouse NaCT as well as for the marked species-specific difference in citrate affinity.
