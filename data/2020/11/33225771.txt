Introduction: Cancer has always been a menace to society. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal and 3rd largest causes of deaths around the world. HCC has shown a high mortality rate due to multidrug resistance, late diagnosis, high side-effects associated with chemotherapy, and the chance of tumor recurrence. Area covered: The emergence of natural actives is considered the greatest boon for fighting cancer. The natural actives take precedence over the traditional chemotherapeutic drugs in terms of their multi-target, multi-level and coordinated effects in the treatment of HCC. Literature reports indicate the tremendous potential of bioactive natural products in inhibiting the HCC via molecular drug targeting, augmented bioavailability, and the ability for both passive or active targeting and stimulus-responsive drug release characteristics. This review provides an overview of the various factors responsible for causing HCC along with newer treatment approaches involved in the mechanism of action of different natural actives used for the HCC treatment via different molecular pathways. Besides, the promising advantage of natural bioactive-loaded nanocarriers in HCC treatment has also been also presented in this review. Expert opinion: The remarkable outcomes have been observed with the therapeutic efficacy of the nanocarriers of natural actives in the treatment of HCC. Furthermore, it requires a thorough assessment of the safety and efficacy evaluation of the nanocarriers for the delivery of targeted natural active ingredients in HCC.
