Kr√ºppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a transcription factor highly conserved in evolution. It is particularly well known for its role in inducing pluripotent stem cells. In addition, KLF4 plays many roles in cancer. The results of most studies suggest that KLF4 is a tumor suppressor. However, the functioning of KLF4 is regulated at many levels. These include regulation of transcription, alternative splicing, miRNA, post-translational modifications, subcellular localization, protein stability and interactions with other molecules. Simple experiments aimed at assaying transcript levels or protein levels fail to address this complexity and thus may deliver misleading results. Tumor subtypes are also important; for example, in prostate cancer KLF4 is highly expressed in indolent tumors where it impedes tumor progression, while it is absent from aggressive prostate tumors. KLF4 is important in regulating response to many known drugs, and it also plays a role in tumor microenvironment. More and more information is available about upstream regulators, downstream targets and signaling pathways associated with the involvement of KLF4 in cancer. Furthermore, KLF4 performs critical function in the overall regulation of tissue homeostasis, cellular integrity, and progression towards malignancy. Here we summarize and analyze the latest findings concerning this fascinating transcription factor.
