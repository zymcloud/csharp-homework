Purpose:To assess the safety of locoregional treatment (LRT) combined with nivolumab for intermediate and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:A single-center retrospective review included 29 patients undergoing 41 LRTs-transarterial chemoembolization or yttrium-90 transarterial radioembolization-60 days before or concurrently with nivolumab. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory values and adverse events were reviewed before and after nivolumab initiation and after each LRT. Treatment response and time to progression were assessed using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Clinical events, including nivolumab termination, death, and time of last follow-up, were assessed.Results:Over a median nivolumab course of 8.1 months (range, 1.0-30) with a median of 14.2 2-week cycles (range, 1-53), predominantly Child-Pugh A (22/29) patients-12 Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) B and 17 BCLC C-underwent 20 transarterial chemoembolization and 21 transarterial radioembolization LRTs at a median of 67 days (range, 48-609) after nivolumab initiation. Ten patients underwent multiple LRTs. During a median follow-up of 11.5 months (range, 1.8-35.1), no grade III/IV adverse events attributable to nivolumab were observed. There were five instances of grade III/IV hypoalbuminemia or hyperbilirubinemia within 3 months after LRT. There were no nivolumab-related deaths, and 30-day mortality after LRT was 0%.Conclusions:LRTs performed concurrently with nivolumab immunotherapy demonstrate an acceptable safety profile in patients with intermediate and advanced HCC.
