Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global public health problem. HBV vaccination is the most effective tool to reduce the incidence of HBV disease. Despite there has not been new clinical developments for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the last few years, changing epidemiology and current insights on natural history, diagnostic tools and therapy indications make necessary an update of the former version of the consensus document of the Spanish Association for Study of the Liver on the treatment of hepatitis B infection published in 2012. The current document updates the management of chronic hepatitis B. The treatment of choice is the long-term administration of a nucleos(t)ide analogue with high barrier to resistance (entecavir, tenofovir or tenofovir alafenamide). Pegylated interferon may be an option in patients with non-advanced liver disease, but its applicability is limited due to the low efficacy and poor tolerability. All patients must be monitored for the risk of progression to advanced liver disease and development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
