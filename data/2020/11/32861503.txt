Embolic events are associated with increased mortality in patients with infective endocarditis (IE). The goal of this study was to gain experience with the application of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in IE to detect abdominal complications. CEUS was performed in 40 patients from a prospective register of IE. CEUS was able to detect abdominal embolic events or metastatic infection in 12 patients (30%). Most commonly seen were splenic infarctions (n = 10), followed by renal infarction (n = 2), liver abscess (n = 1) and mycotic aneurysm (n = 1). Six out of 14 lesions were only detected by CEUS and not by conventional ultrasound. Abdominal complications revealed by CEUS were associated with a detectable valve vegetation (p = 0.04) and larger vegetation size (p = 0.01). In three patients, a non-IE related abdominal lesion (two hepatocellular carcinomas, one psoas hematoma) was detected. CEUS is a feasible diagnostic method in detection of abdominal complications of IE.
