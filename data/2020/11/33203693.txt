Background:IL27 mRNA is highly enriched in the tissue of hepatocellular carcinoma. Overexpression of IL27 gene has been found to increase T-cell expression of inhibitory receptors, an immunosuppressive feature in tumor microenvironment, that promotes the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Two parallel case-control studies of hepatocellular carcinoma, each with 100 case-control pairs were conducted in the Singapore Chinese Health Study and the Shanghai Cohort Study to examine the association between serum IL27 levels and risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:The IL27 concentrations were significantly elevated in sera collected from study participants 4 to 5 years prior to the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in both cohort studies. Compared with the lowest tertile of IL27, odds ratios (OR) of hepatocellular carcinoma for the highest tertile of IL27 was 46.08 [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.68-453.86] in the Singapore Chinese Health Study and 19.09 (95% CI, 3.81-95.57) in the Shanghai Cohort Study (both P trend <0.001). The corresponding ORs in both cohort studies were 42.47 (95% CI, 8.30-217.40) among individuals negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 242.46 (95% CI, 38.42-1,529.01) among those positive for HBsAg compared with the lowest tertile of interleukin-27 and negative HBsAg.Conclusion:Levels of IL27 in prediagnostic sera were significantly associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development.Impact:IL27, through its immunosuppressive property, may play a significant role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum levels of IL27 may be used as a biomarker for prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma development.
