Background:Information on the epidemiology of pediatric liver tumors in Latin America is limited.Purpose:To describe the incidence of liver tumors in a pediatric registry in Argentina according to geographic region, national trends over 16 years, and survival related to stage, age, sex, and care center.Methods:Newly diagnosed liver tumors cases are registered in the Argentine Pediatric Oncology Hospital Registry (ROHA) with an estimated coverage of 91% of national cases. Age-standardized incidence rate per millon (ASR) was calculated based on the National Vital Statistics Reports. Five-year overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare subgroup survival.Results:Two hundred seven cases of hepatoblastoma (HB) and 73 of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were identified. ASR of liver tumors was 1.8/million (95% confidence Interval [CI], 1.6-2.0) per year. ASR was 1.4 (1.2-1.6) for HB and 0.4 (0.3-0.5) for HCC. For HB, the highest incidence was found in the northwest region including the Altiplano. OS was 60.4% (53.4-66.8) for HB and 36.1% (25.2-47.2) for HCC. Five-year survival rate of children with metastatic HB treated at liver transplant hospitals (LTH) was 54.2% (30.3-73.0) compared to 13.3% (2.2-34.6) for those seen at other hospitals (OH) (P = .02), while for HCC this rate was 46.3% (30.7-60.6) at LTH compared to 17.5% (3.1-41.9) at OH (P = .01).Conclusions:The incidence rate of pediatric liver tumors was stable over the 16-year study period. Patients may benefit if at treatment initiation they are evaluated jointly with LTH specialists to define treatment strategies.
