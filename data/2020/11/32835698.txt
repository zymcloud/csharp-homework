Aims:Deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33) is abnormally expressed in various tumors and participates in tumor progression. However, the expression and biological role of USP33 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unclear.Main methods:We performed immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qRT-PCR analysis to determine the expression of USP33 in HCC. We then analyzed the effects of USP33 expression on the prognosis of HCC. The roles of USP33 in regulating HCC cell migration and invasion were further explored in vitro. Animal studies were performed to investigate the effects of USP33 on tumor metastasis. RNA sequencing and luciferase reporter and immunofluorescence assays were used to identify the activation of the specificity protein 1 (SP1)/c-Met axis.Key findings:Here, for the first time, we reported an abnormal increase in the expression of USP33 in HCC tissues and that USP33 may act as a prognostic biomarker for HCC patients. We found that USP33 knockdown inhibited the invasion and metastasis in HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, which was partly dependent on c-Met. Further investigations revealed that USP33 regulated c-Met expression by enhancing the protein stability of the transcription factor SP1 in HCC cells. Mechanistically, USP33 directly bound SP1 and decreased its ubiquitination, thereby upregulating c-Met expression.Significance:Our results reveal that USP33 acts as the deubiquitinating enzyme of SP1 and contributes to HCC invasion and metastasis through activation of the SP1/c-Met axis. These data indicate a previously unknown function of USP33, which may provide potential targets for the treatment of HCC patients.
