Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers all over the world. Several studies have explored if immune-related genes and tumor immune microenvironment could play roles in HCC prognoses. This study is aimed at developing a prognostic signature of HCC based on immune-related genes or tumor immune microenvironment to predict survival and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We constructed a prognostic signature using bioinformatics method and validated its predictive capability. The mechanisms of the signature prediction were explored with The Cancer Immunome Atlas (TCIA) and mutation analysis. We also explored the association between the signature and immunophenoscore (IPS), which is the marker of ICIs response. A 6 immune-related-gene (6-IRG) signature was developed. It was revealed in a multivariate analysis that the 6-IRG signature was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival and progression-free interval among HCC patients. In the high-risk group of 6-IRG signature score, macrophage M0 cells and regulatory T cells, which are observed associated with poor overall survival in our study, were higher. The low-risk group had a higher IPS, which meant a better response to ICIs. Taken together, we constructed a reliable 6-IRG signature for prediction of survival and response to ICIs. The signature needs further testing for clinical application.
