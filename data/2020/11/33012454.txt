External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) has improved efficacy and safety with advancements in technology and techniques. EBRT plays an important role in management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In resectable cases, EBRT serves as a bridge to transplantation or improves local control through adjuvant radiotherapy. In unresectable patients, EBRT offers high local control rates. In metastatic settings, EBRT provides effective palliation. This review presents an overview of radiotherapy treatment modalities used for HCC, current treatment guidelines for the role of EBRT in HCC, clinical outcomes between various EBRT approaches and other locoregional treatments for HCC, and the future role of EBRT for HCC.
