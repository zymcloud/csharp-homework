Objective:To investigate the impact of menopausal status on the prognosis for sex-classified Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to establish prognostic nomograms for patients after liver resection.Results:After propensity score matching (PSM), statistically significant differences in both overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were found between men and women HCC patients. Based on Cox regression analysis, these differences were evident in the normal menstruation (N) group expanded with male patients, but not in either the expanded postmenopausal (P) or intermediate (I) groups. Sex disparity was also apparent in the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of the total HCC patients. Integrated with independent factors, nomograms for the OS and RFS of the expanded N group showed higher C-indices of 0.773 and 0.724, respectively, than those of nomograms for the total patients and BCLC stage (PConclusion:Sex disparity appears to affect both the survival and recurrence of HCC only in normal menstruation women and their matched men. For predicting survival, prognostic nomograms derived from the expanded N group of HCC patients were more accurate for patients with the same clinical conditions.Methods:The patients (390 females and 1920 males), who underwent curative liver resection for HCC during 2008 to 2012, were screened. The 390 women were divided into three groups: normal menstruation, intermediate, and postmenopausal. To overcome selection bias, the three groups of females were matched with males at a ratio of 1:2, using propensity score matching. Based on further Cox regression analysis, independent factors were integrated into nomograms for OS and RFS by R rms. The accuracy and discrimination of the nomograms were evaluated by the C-index, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis.
