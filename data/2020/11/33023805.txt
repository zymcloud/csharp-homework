Purpose:The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of drug-eluting embolic (DEE) transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who are ineligible for curative treatment, using doxorubicin-loaded Tandem (Varian Medical) microspheres.Materials and methods:Between October 2015 and December 2017, 98 patients with unresectable HCC (69 males, 29 females; mean age, 60.5 ± 10.0 years of age; and American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage ≦T3a) treated with DEE transarterial chemoembolization using 100-μm doxorubicin-loaded microspheres were enrolled prospectively. All studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging 1 month after treatment was used for tumor response assessment according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and downstaging profile.Results:Median follow-up was 21.2 months. At follow-up examinations at 0.5-, 1-, 1.5- and 2.5-year follow-up, OS rates were 93.8%, 89.5%, 79.4%, and 77.0%, respectively. Complete response (CR), partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were noted in 50 (51.0%), 23 (23.5%), 18 (18.4%), and 7 (7.1%) patients, respectively, with 93.9% disease control rate and 74.5% objective response rate. Mean OS was 28.7 months, and mean PFS was 19.6 months. Number of nodules >3, bilobar disease, larger tumor, and higher AJCC stage correlated with worse CR. No serious adverse events occurred after DEE transarterial chemoembolization. Successful downstage rate was 73.3% (22 of 30) and number of nodules predicting successful downstaging was 7 nodules (cutoff).Conclusions:Tandem DEE transarterial chemoembolization provides safe and effective treatment for HCC and a bridge or downstage therapy for liver transplantation.
