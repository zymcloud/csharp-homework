Background and aim:Yttrium-90 resin microsphere radioembolization (RE) is not recommended for routine use in intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by recent guidelines. This study aims to establish pre-treatment variables which predict survival in HCC patients treated with RE to identify those who will benefit most from it, and to inform patient selection for future trials.Methods:Single center, retrospective study of consecutive patients with HCC treated with RE from 2007 to 2018. Patients included if undergoing their first RE treatment for intermediate or advanced HCC; a Child-Pugh score of B7 or less; and a performance status of 1 or less. Multivariable Cox regression identified variables that were significantly associated with survival. A predictive score was developed based upon coefficients from the fitted Cox regression model, and cubic spline regression was used to identify prognostic groups.Results:One hundred thirteen patients with intermediate (53.1%) and advanced HCC (45.1%) followed for a median of 13.2 months were included. Variables associated with superior survival used to derive the MAAPE score were lower Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (≤ 7), lower Alpha-fetoprotein (≤ 150 IU/L), higher serum Albumin (> 37 g/L), absence of Portal vein tumor thrombus, and better performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group = 0). Three survival prognostic groups were identified: good (median overall survival 25.0 months), average (15.3 months), and poor (6.3 months) (overall log-rank test, P Conclusion:The MAAPE score accurately identifies HCC patients in whom RE is safe and effective. This will allow for optimal patient selection for future trials of RE versus systemic therapy.
