Aim:We analyzed the impact of hepatitis C virus eradication by direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy on the risk of development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), prognosis, and portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis.Methods:The rate of HCC development and overall survival after achievement of sustained virological response (SVR) in 173 DAA-treated compensated cirrhosis patients without HCC history were retrospectively compared with that of 125 cirrhosis patients who achieved SVR by interferon (IFN)-based therapy or that of 85 cirrhosis patients who failed to respond to anti-HCV therapy. Changes in esophagogastric varices (EGV) and incidence of portosystemic encephalopathy were analyzed in 87 consecutive cirrhosis patients.Results:The cumulative HCC development rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 2%, 7%, and 7% for the DAA-SVR group, significantly lower than the 3%, 7%, and 18% for the non-SVR group (log-rank, P Conclusion:Achievement of SVR by DAA therapy reduces the risk of HCC development and prolongs survival, similar to theresults achieved with IFN-based therapy, but portal hypertension is not immediately improved in compensated liver cirrhosis patients.
