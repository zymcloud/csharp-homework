Purpose:Liver cancer is considered to be the sixth deadliest cancer worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is known to be the most prevalent type of liver cancer. The number of deaths due to HCC reported per year is on a constant rise especially in lesser developed countries. There are several contributing factors to this rise in number. Among other contributing factors is the late diagnosis of HCC. Patients are usually diagnosed when the disease reaches its advance stage. The present study was conducted with total 30 samples. It was designed for investigating the potential of TGF-β, NF-κβ, VEGF, AKT and PI3K as RNA based biomarkers in tumor educated platelets for early detection of HCC.Results:The results obtained from the transcriptional analysis revealed a significant high expression of TGF-β, NF-κβ, VEGF by 2.48, 2.35 and 2.78 folds respectively in comparison to the control. On the other hand, a decrease in expression by 0.6 and 0.65 folds was observed in AKT and PI3K respectively in comparison to controls. Although all selected RNA biomarkers showed promising potential to detect HCC however, AKT and PI3K were better able to detect early stage HCC.Conclusions:The results obtained clearly indicate the increased expression of TGF-β, NF-κβ, VEGF in HCC patients. All these biomarkers are previously known for cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. The significant decrease in expression of AKT and PI3K in HCC patients needs further investigation. All the selected RNA biomarkers can be used for detection of HCC as they were able to distinguish HCC patients from controls successfully with AKT and PI3K showing better potential to detect early stage HCC. However, translational analysis for all these RNA biomarkers should be performed to gain further evidence for the ability of these biomarkers to be used for early HCC detection.
