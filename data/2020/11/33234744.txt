Backgrounds/aims:To evaluate our initial experience of bridging role of trans-arterial radio-embolization (TARE) before major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in risky patients with small expected remnant liver volume (ERLV).Methods:We reviewed the data of patients with HCC who underwent major hepatectomy after TARE during the period between March and December 2017. Patients included had uni-lobar large HCC (ï¼ž5 cm) requiring major hepatectomy with small ERLV.Results:Five patients were included in our study. All patients were Child Pugh class A. A single session of TARE was applied in all patients. None developed any adverse events related to irradiation. The mean tumor size at baseline was 8.4 cm and 6.1 cm after TARE (p=0.077). The mean % of tumor shrinkage was 24.5%. ERLV improved from 354.6 ml at baseline to 500.8 ml after TARE (p=0.012). ERLV percentage improved from 27.2% at baseline to 38.1% after TARE (p=0.004). The mean % of ERLV was 39.5%. The mean interval time between TARE and resection was 99.6 days. Four patients (80%) underwent right hemi-hepatectomy and one patient (20%) underwent extended right hemi-hepatectomy. The mean operation time was 151 minutes, and mean blood loss was 56 ml. The mean hospital stay was 13.8 days, and one patient (20%) developed postoperative morbidity. After a mean follow-up of 15 months, all patients were alive with no recurrence.Conclusions:Yttrium-90 TARE can play a bridging role before major hepatectomy for borderline resectable HCC in risky patients with small ERLV.
