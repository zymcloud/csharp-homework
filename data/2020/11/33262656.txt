Background and objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often invades the portal vein and its branches to form portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), and it rarely spreads into the bile ducts to cause bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT). However, the clinical prognosis of patients with the two types of tumor thrombus is different. In this manuscript, we plan to compare the prognosis of HCC with PVTT and BDTT for further clinical treatment.Patients and methods:A total of 60 patients including 48 HCC cases with PVTT and 12 HCC cases with BDTT were enrolled in the study. The medical records were collected from participants. The follow-up was performed in 3 years post-hepatectomy. Statistical analysis was performed to explore the relationship between tumor thrombus with clinicopathological characteristics, to determine the significant preoperative factors influencing overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR), and to establish the survival and recurrent curves.Results:HCC with BDTT or PVTT often combined with viral hepatitis B, accompanied by varying degrees of cirrhosis, and high AFP level (68.3%), complete tumor capsule (76.7%), and larger tumor size (85.0%). Furtherly, patients with HCC and BDTT tended to have higher total bilirubin (TB) and more possibility of lymph node metastases. The multivariate Cox hazard analyses also revealed that both tumor size and tumor thrombus could be taken as independent prognostic indicators of HCC patients. Survival curves showed that the 1-, 2- and 3-year OS or DFS rates of HCC patients with BDTT were significantly lower than those of HCC patients with PVTT, respectively.Conclusion:Tumor thrombus is an independent risk factor for poor survival and high recurrence in HCC. HCC patients with BDTT had shorter overall survival and higher tumor recurrence rate compared to HCC patients with PVTT.
