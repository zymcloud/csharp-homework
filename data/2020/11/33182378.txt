Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often develops from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) through replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Calcium (Ca2+) signaling plays an essential role in HBV replication. Store-operated calcium (SOC) channels are a major pathway of Ca2+ entry into non-excitable cells such as immune cells and cancer cells. The basic components of SOC signaling include the STIM1 and ORAI1 genes. However, the roles of STIM1 and ORAI1 in HBV-mediated HCC are still unclear. Thus, long-term follow-up of HBV cohort was carried out in this study. This study recruited 3631 patients with chronic hepatitis (345 patients with HCC, 3286 patients without HCC) in a Taiwanese population. Genetic variants of the STIM1 and ORAI1 genes were detected using an Axiom CHB1 genome-wide array. Clinical associations of 40 polymorphisms were analyzed. Three of the STIM1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs6578418, rs7116520, and rs11030472) and one SNP of ORAI1 (rs6486795) showed a trend of being associated with HCC disease (p < 0.05). However, after correction for multiple testing, none of the SNPs reached a significant level (q > 0.05); in contrast, neither STIM1 nor ORAI1 showed a significant association with HCC progression in CHB patients. Functional studies by both total internal reflection fluorescence images and transwell migration assay indicated the critical roles of SOC-mediated signaling in HCC migration. In conclusion, we reported a weak correlation between STIM1/ORAI1 polymorphisms and the risk of HCC progression in CHB patients.
