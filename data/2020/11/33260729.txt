Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal-dependent pathway for degrading cytoplasmic proteins, macromolecules, and organelles. Autophagy-related genes (Atgs) are the core molecular machinery in the control of autophagy, and several major functional groups of Atgs coordinate the entire autophagic process. Autophagy plays a dual role in liver cancer development via several critical signaling pathways, including the PI3K-AKT-mTOR, AMPK-mTOR, EGF, MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, p53, and NF-κB pathways. Here, we review the signaling pathways involved in the cross-talk between autophagy and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and analyze the status of the development of novel HCC therapy by targeting the core molecular machinery of autophagy as well as the key signaling pathways. The induction or the inhibition of autophagy by the modulation of signaling pathways can confer therapeutic benefits to patients. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-link of autophagy and HCC may extend to translational studies that may ultimately lead to novel therapy and regimen formation in HCC treatment.
