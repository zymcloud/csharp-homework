Serum autoantibodies have been reported to react with tumor-associated antigen (TAA) in various cancers. This multicenter study evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of six autoantibodies against a panel of six hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated antigens, including Sui1, p62, RalA, p53, NY-ESO-1 and c-myc. A total of 160 patients with HCC and 74 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled from six institutions. Serum antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The sensitivities were 19% for Sui1, 18% for p62, 17% for RalA, 11% for p53, 10% for NY-ESO-1 and 9% for c-myc. Overall sensitivity of the TAA panel (56%) was higher than that of Î±-fetoprotein (41%, P
