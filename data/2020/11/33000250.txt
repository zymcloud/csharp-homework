Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer‑related morbidity and mortality globally. Despite the remarkable improvements in comprehensive HCC treatment, the underlying mechanistic details of HCC remain elusive. We screened HCC patients for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE113850) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. LINC01554 expression in 40 paired samples was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR), and its clinical significance was assessed. LINC01554 was found to have a gain‑of‑function role in HCC in vitro. Additionally, the bioinformatics analysis of the genes co‑expressed with LINC01554 was performed using the Co‑LncRNA website, and potential molecular mechanisms were investigated using the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes resources and validated by in vitro experiments. A total of 229 DEGs were identified from the GSE113850 dataset. Among the identified DEGs, three long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (DIO3OS, LINC01554, and LINC01093) with |logFC| ≥2 and P
