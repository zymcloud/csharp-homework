Hereditary hemochromatosis and alpha-1antitrypsin deficiency are genetic diseases characterized by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress with subsequent development of liver disease. Our aim was to estimate the frequency of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutant alleles (C282Y and H63D) and alpha-1 antitrypsin S/Z variants among Egyptian HCV cirrhotic patients and in hepatocellular carcinoma patients and to evaluate their effects on disease progression. HFE and alpha-1 antitrypsin polymorphisms were characterized in 200 Egyptian patients with HCV infection (100 patients complicated with cirrhosis, 100 patients with HCC) and 100 healthy subjects who had no history of any malignancy. The frequencies of HD genotype of H63D mutation were significantly increased in HCC patients compared to control group and to cirrhosis group. Also, the frequencies of DD genotype were significantly increased In HCC group compared to control group and to cirrhosis group. Our results suggested that Carriers of the D allele of H63D mutation were significantly more likely to develop HCC.
