Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality in many countries. Evaluation of new susceptibility risk factors is therefore warranted in order to explore means to improve the survival rate. Here, we report on a novel HCC-related gene known as lysosomal protein transmembrane 4 beta (LAPTM4B) that has two alleles designated LAPTM4B*1 and LAPTM4B*2. Allele *1 differs from allele *2 in that it contains one copy of a 19-bp sequence, whereas this sequence is duplicated in allele *2 in exon 1 of LAPTM4B. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between LAPTM4B allelic variation and HCC susceptibility. The LAPTM4B genotype was analyzed in the blood samples from 102 HCC patients and 135 healthy individuals by PCR. The genotypic distribution of LAPTM4B was analyzed using the chi-squared test. The frequencies of allele *2 were 38.24 and 24.07% in the HCC group and control group, respectively, representing a significant difference between these two groups (P
