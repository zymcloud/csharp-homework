Background & aims:Frequent repression of the Socs1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1) gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and increased susceptibility of SOCS1-deficient mice to hepatocarcinogens suggest a tumor suppressor role for SOCS1 in the liver, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigated the role of SOCS1 in regulating hepatocyte proliferation following partial hepatectomy and HGF stimulation.Methods:Because Socs1(-/-) mice die prematurely due to deregulated IFNÎ³ signaling, we used Socs1(-/-)Ifng(-/-) mice to study the role of SOCS1 in liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy. We examined the activation of signaling molecules downstream of IL-6 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptors in the regenerating liver, primary hepatocytes, and in human hepatoma cells. We examined the interaction between SOCS1 and the HGF receptor c-Met by reciprocal immunoprecipitation.Results:Socs1(-/-)Ifng(-/-) mice displayed accelerated liver regeneration with increased DNA synthesis compared to Ifng(-/-) and wild type mice. The regenerating liver of Socs1(-/-)Ifng(-/-) mice did not show increased IL-6 signaling, but displayed earlier phosphorylation of Gab1, a signaling adaptor downstream of c-Met. Following HGF stimulation, hepatocytes from Socs1(-/-)Ifng(-/-) mice displayed increased phosphorylation of c-Met and Gab1, cell migration and proliferation. Accordingly, SOCS1 overexpression attenuated HGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met, Gab1, and ERK1/2 in hepatoma cells, and decreased their proliferation and migration. SOCS1 interacted with the Tpr-Met, an oncogenic form of the Met receptor.Conclusions:SOCS1 attenuates c-Met signaling and thus negative regulation of HGF signaling could be an important mechanism underlying the anti-tumor role of SOCS1 in the liver.
