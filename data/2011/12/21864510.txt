Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death. Different signaling pathways are de-regulated in this pathogenesis, among them the epidermal growth factor receptor one (EGFR/Erb1). Here we show that blockage of this pathway by the tyrphostin 4-(3-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (AG1478) in different liver tumor cell lines promotes both inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death, which are coincident with arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. AG1478 up-regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family BIM and down-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-XL and MCL1. Furthermore, it also decreases the levels of the caspase inhibitors HIAP2 and XIAP. The treatment of HCC cells with AG1478 enhanced the apoptosis induced by other pro-apoptotic stimuli, such as the physiological cytokine, TGF-Î², highly expressed in liver tumors, or the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. The effects observed by AG1478 were broader than the ones seen by silencing of the EGFR with siRNA, which indicates that this drug might act on other targets different from the EGFR. In this same line of evidence, AG1478 retained some cytotoxic effects in cells where EGFR has been targeted knock-down with shRNA. Interestingly, AG1478 preferentially acts on liver tumor cells, being untransformed cells much less responsive to its cytotoxic effects. In conclusion, AG1478 could be a potential therapeutic drug to be used in HCC.
