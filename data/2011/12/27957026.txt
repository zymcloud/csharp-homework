Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered the most common etiology of chronic liver disease in Egypt, which may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies have documented an association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and liver cirrhosis with or without HCC. This study aimed to investigate the presence of H. pylori DNA in the liver tissue of Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).Methods:Fifty-two CHC Egyptian patients were enrolled in this study. Plasma anti-H. pylori IgG was assessed with ELISA. Liver biopsies were tested for presence of Helicobacter DNA using genus specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and species was identified by sequencing.Results:Anti-H. pylori IgG was detected in 31/52 (59.6%) CHC patients while Helicobacter DNA was detected in 6 (11.5%) patients, all were H. Pylori by sequencing. Helicobacter DNA was more frequent in patients with high stage liver fibrosis (33.3%) than in those with low stage fibrosis (2.7%) (P = 0.006). There was no association between the presence of H. pylori DNA in the liver and age, gender of patients, liver function tests, AFP levels or viral load.Conclusions:These data confirm the presence of H. pylori DNA in liver of some CHC Egyptian patients and suggest an association of this bacterium with progression of liver fibrosis.
