The outcome of liver transplantation (LT) is dependent on many factors including graft quality, surgical techniques, postoperative care, immunosuppressive regimens and most importantly, careful pre-transplant recipient evaluation and selection. Currently, the expected 1-year and 5-year survival rates after LT are 85-95% and 75-85%, respectively. The improvement in outcomes and better awareness has resulted in an increasing demand for LT around the world including India. Transplant physicians have responded to this increased demand by developing several strategies including the use of older donors, grafts from hepatitis C positive donors or those with previous hepatitis B infection (positive hepatitis B virus [HBV] core immunoglobulin G [IgG] antibody), graft from nonheart beating donors, domino transplantation (liver from patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy transplanted into older recipients), split-liver grafts, and live donor liver transplant (LDLT). Currently, the only treatment that prolongs survival in those with end-stage acute or chronic liver failure is transplantation of either partial or full liver donor graft. Because of the enormous disparity in supply and demand for donor organs, costs, and potential morbidity and mortality of live donors in LDLT, it has become incumbent on the transplant community to ration the available organs in a way that provides the best outcomes and in the process, serves the best interest of the population as a whole. When evaluating a potential candidate for LT, it is imperative to determine whether the recipient is going to benefit from the procedure immediately and in the long-term. In this review, we will discuss the process of selection and optimal evaluation of potential LT recipients.
