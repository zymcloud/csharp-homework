The aims of this study are to investigate the relationship between p39 expression and clinicopathological parameters of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to evaluate the prognostic value of p39 for HCC patients. Real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry was used to measure p39 expression in tumor and adjacent nontumor samples. Relationships of p39 expression with clinical parameters and patient survival were analyzed. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that the quantity of p39 mRNA in cancerous tissue was significantly lower than that in nontumor tissue (P
