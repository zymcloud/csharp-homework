Objective:To investigate the clinical efficacy of cryotherapy ablation treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and to analyse the predictive factors of cryotherapy ablation treatment.Methods:190 patients of hepatitis B-related advanced HCC from 2005 to 2008 in our hospital underwent curative cryoablation. We used clinical cohort method to analyze cryoablation group (147 cases) and control group (43 cases). The median OS (over survival time) and TTP (time to disease progression) were compared. We also evaluated the clinical significance of age, gender, location of portal vein tumor thrombus, HBeAg, tumor histological grade, Child-Pugh classification, end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, advanced liver cancer prediction system (ALCPS) score and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score for predicting the efficacy of cryoablation. Two Groups were compared with the xÂ² test. Survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the independent factors on survival based on the variables selected in univariate analysis.Results:Median survival time of cryoablation group and Control group were 7.5 (4.2 to 14.6) months and 3.2 (1.2 to 8.6) months, median TTP were 3.5 (2.5 to 4.5) months and 1.5 (1.0 to 3.5 months), the differences between were statistically significant (P Conclusions:Cryoablation treatment can prolong median OS and TTP of advanced HCC. ECOG PS and ALCPS are important predictors for survival time of advanced HCC.
