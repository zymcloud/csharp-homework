Aim:Follow-up and review of patients who underwent surgery for renal cell cancer combined with tumor thrombus of the inferior vena cava at the Department of Urology Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.Material and methods:From l998 to 2010 twenty one patients underwent surgery for renal cell cancer combined with tumor thrombus of the inferior caval vein. Preoperative symptoms, TNM classification of the tumors, types of surgical interventions, complications, postoperative management and survival results were involved in the analysis. Mean follow-up period was 39 months, ranging from 3 to 101 months.Results:In five cases of level 3 thrombi the liver was mobilized without thoracotomy, and endoluminar occlusion was applied in one case. Intraoperative mortality was 9,5%. Survival time of patients with distant metastases was 12.1 months (3-9). Three patients without metastases died in the follow up period, their survival time was 26.7 months ranging from 22 to 31 months. Eight patients (73%) were alive at the time of the last follow-up. The mean survival time was 5.6 years ranging from 39 to 101 months.Conclusion:Our results support that level 3 caval vein tumor thrombus can be removed by less aggressive surgical approach and underline the benefit of the surgical intervention without thoracotomy.
