The purpose of our study was to evaluate initial results following introduction of Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) and Cytoreductive Surgery (CS). Twenty two patients with intraperitoneal malignancy undergone cytoreductive surgery (CS) and hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC) between January of 2007 and January 2010. Nine patients had adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin, 8 patients had ovarian cancer, and 5 had pseudomyxoma peritonei. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis based on intraoperative assessment during first operative procedure for intraabdominal malignancy or follow-up diagnostic imaging proof Excluded were patients with known malignant proliferation outside abdomen, liver metastasis and ASA score 4 and higher. All patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei diagnosis are alive, with mean follow-up time 24.8 months (range 15-35). In group of patients with adenocarcinoma from colorectal origin, 3 died, resulting in mean survival time 7.6 months (range 1-16). In group of patients with ovarian cancer, 2 died, resulting in mean survival time 13.8 months (range 0-31). Two patients died in early postoperative period. Most of the patients had some sort of mental disorder. Although HIPEC with CS improves survival, during introduction period higher morbidity and mortality could be expected.
