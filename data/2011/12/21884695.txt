This study was aimed to evaluate the clinical value of plasma methylation analysis of a panel of four genes (APC, GSTP1, RASSF1A, and SFRP1), which was identified by our previous work, for the noninvasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The methylation status of these four genes in 150 plasma samples from 72 patients with HCC, 37 benign live diseases and 41 normal controls was detected with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes-based quantitative PCR (MSRE-qPCR) method. The plasma methylation levels of APC, GSTP1, RASSF1A, and SFRP1 were significantly higher in HCCs than those in normal or benign controls (P
