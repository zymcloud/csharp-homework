Background:Hepatitis B virus infection is closely related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is overexpressed in HCC and considered to play a role in hepatic carcinogenesis. In this study, we analyzed the polymorphism of COX-2 promoter -899G/C in healthy controls, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, liver cirrhosis patients, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, to investigate the relationship between COX-2 -899G/C polymorphism and the risk for hepatitis B-related liver cancer in a Chinese population from Gansu province.Methods:Patients were divided into four groups: 300 patients with CHB, 300 patients with liver cirrhosis, 300 patients with HCC, and 300 healthy controls. The polymorphism of COX-2 -899G/C was detected by PCR-TaqMan probes. The results were analyzed by SPSS 17.0.Results:The COX-2 -899G/C genotypes were GG, GC, and CC. Frequencies in CHB were 87.00%, 12.67%, 0.33%; in liver cirrhosis were 85.33%, 14.00%, 0.67%; in HCC were 77.00%, 21.67%, 1.33%; and in healthy controls were 90.67%, 9.00%, 0.33%, respectively. COX-2 -899C carriers may have an increased risk for hepatitis B-related liver cancer. Compared with the frequency of GG genotype, there were significant differences in the frequency of GC genotype between HCC and healthy control groups (OR = 2.835, 95%CI: 1.751 - 4.589); HCC and CHB groups (OR = 1.933, 95%CI: 1.248 - 2.994); and HCC and liver cirrhosis groups (OR = 1.175, 95%CI: 1.119 - 2.628). Stratification analyses showed that COX-2 -899C allele carriers with a drinking history are more susceptible to develop HCC.Conclusion:COX-2 -899C genotype may increase the susceptibility of individuals to hepatitis B-related liver cancer in Gansu province, China.
