We describe how we resected a hepatic angiomyolipoma and ascending colon cancer synchronously via laparoscopic left lateral segmentectomy and laparoscopic right colectomy, respectively. The patient was a 72-year-old man, admitted to our hospital after a liver tumor and ascending colon cancer were detected during a general health check. Computed tomography (CT) showed a hypervascular liver tumor mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 cm in diameter, in segment 3 of the liver. The ascending colon cancer was diagnosed as T2N0M0, Stage I. The left lateral liver and right colon were mobilized laparoscopically and hepatic transaction, followed by resection and anastomosis of the colon, were performed extracorporeally through the same 7-cm upper median incision. This type of laparoscopy-assisted combined resection is useful to obtain a pathological diagnosis of the liver tumor and to remove the entire tumor in a minimally invasive and cosmetic manner.
