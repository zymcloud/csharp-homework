The 14-bp insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism located in the 3' UTR of the human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) gene plays a role in several autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. HLA-G expression is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis, especially in early stage, with high expression independently associated with shortened overall survival and increased tumor recurrence. In the present study, we carried out a case-control study in a Chinese population (318 cases and 599 controls) to estimate the susceptibility to HCC associated with the 14-bp indel polymorphism. Logistic regression analysis showed that the heterozygote and the homozygote 14-bp ins/ins confer a lower risk of HCC (adjusted OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57-1.01, p = 0.061; OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.30-0.98, p = 0.031, respectively). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) stratification analysis showed that the associations were stronger in the HBV-positive population. Immunohistochemical analysis further showed that HLA-G expression in HCC tissues with 14-bp del/del genotype was more prominent than for heterozygous and 14-bp ins/ins genotype (p
