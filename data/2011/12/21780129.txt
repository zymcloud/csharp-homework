Background and objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignant neoplasms worldwide, and the second leading cause of death from cancer in Taiwan. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an angiogenic chemokine with important roles in the development and progression of many human malignancies including HCC. This study investigates the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-8 gene on the susceptibility and clinicopathological characteristics of HCC.Methods:One hundred thirty-one HCC patients and 340 control subjects were analyzed for four IL-8 SNPs (-251 T/A, +781 C/T, +1633 C/T, and +2767 A/T) using PCR-RFLP genotyping analysis.Results:After adjusting for other confounders, results show that individuals with the IL-8 +781 T/T polymorphic genotype had a significantly lower risk of developing HCC than those with the wild-type (C/C) genotype (AOR = 0.346; 95% CI: 0.132-0.909). Multiple regression analysis showed that the presence of T/A or A/A at IL-8 -251 may indicate higher potential risk of hepatitis B infection (AOR = 2.847; 95% CI: 1.083-8.656). Additionally, these four IL-8 SNPs did not associate with liver-related clinicopathological markers in serum.Conclusions:Genetic polymorphism at IL-8 +781 is an important factor in determining susceptibility to HCC in the Taiwanese population.
