Graphitic nanomaterials are promising candidates for applications in electronics, energy, materials and biomedical areas. Nevertheless, few detailed studies related to the mechanistic understanding of these nanomaterials with the living systems have been performed to date. In the present study, our group applied the iTRAQ-coupled 2D LC-MS/MS approach to analyze the protein profile change of human hepatoma HepG2 cells treated with graphene and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), with the purpose of characterizing the interactions between living system and these nanomaterials at molecular level. Overall 37 differentially expressed proteins involved in metabolic pathway, redox regulation, cytoskeleton formation and cell growth were identified. Based on the protein profile, we found SWCNTs severely interfered the intracellular metabolic routes, protein synthesis and cytoskeletal systems. Moreover, our data suggested that SWCNTs might induce oxidative stress, thereby activating p53-mediated DNA damage checkpoint signals and leading to apoptosis. However, only moderate variation of protein levels for the cells treated with graphene was observed, which indicated graphene was less toxic and might be promising candidate for biomedical applications. We envision that this systematic characterization of cellular response at protein expression level will be of great importance to evaluate biocompatibility of nanomaterials.
