Background:Risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have geographic variability but differences in care have not been described. We reviewed the presentation, management, and outcomes of HCC patients from two tertiary-referral centers in Central Saudi Arabia and Atlantic Canada during 1997-2002.Methods:Data were extracted from health records of 96 Saudi and 80 Canadian consecutive patients with HCC.Results:Mean age (Â± SEM) of the two groups were similar (64 + 1 and 65 + 1 years) with 93% versus 75% males amongst Canadian and Saudi patients, respectively. In Canada, underlying disease was alcohol-related cirrhosis (45%), cryptogenic cirrhosis (26%), or hepatitis C (13%). For Saudis, HCC cases were attributed to hepatitis C (47%), cryptogenic cirrhosis (27%), and hepatitis B (21%). At initial presentation, Saudi patients had more vascular invasion and distant metastases while Canadians had more advanced liver disease. The tumor-specific prognostic classifications were comparable. Due to center-specific expertise or preference, symptomatic treatment was more common amongst Saudi patients (83% versus 42%) while more Canadians underwent local palliative interventions (52% versus 12%). Frequency of potentially curative therapies including resection and transplantation were similar at both centers. There was no difference in overall median survival (14 versus 10 months) amongst Canadian and Saudi patients.Conclusions:This study validates divergence in HCC presentation between low and high endemic regions for viral hepatitis. In addition, for the first time, differences in cancer care of HCC are documented.
