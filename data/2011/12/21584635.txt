Treatment of primary and secondary hepatic malignancies with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) represents an essential component of interventional oncology known for many years and performed by many interventional radiologists first in primary liver tumors and nowadays even in metastases of different origins. Radioembolization (RE) has been introduced to the clinical arsenal of cytoreductive modalities in recent years. There is growing evidence for efficiency in liver tumors of various entities, with the most prominent ones being hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors. Hepatic metastases of other tumor entities (breast cancer, malignant melanoma, and pancreatic cancer) are treatment-sensitive. This article focuses on procedural and technical aspects for selection, preparation, and performance of treatment as well as the results in metastatic breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer giving an overview of the results after RE, transarterial embolization, or TACE.
