Aim:To analyze the outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection in cirrhosis patients, related to presence of portal hypertension (PH) and extent of hepatectomy.Methods:A retrospective analysis of 135 patients with HCC on a background of cirrhosis was submitted to curative liver resection.Results:PH was present in 44 (32.5%) patients. Overall mortality and morbidity were 2.2% and 33.7%, respectively. Median survival time in patients with or without PH was 31.6 and 65.1 mo, respectively (P = 0.047); in the subgroup with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, median survival was 65.1 mo and 60.5 mo, respectively (P = 0.257). Survival for patients submitted to limited liver resection was not significantly different in presence or absence of PH. Conversely, median survival for patients after resection of 2 or more segments with or without PH was 64.4 mo and 163.9 mo, respectively (P = 0.035).Conclusion:PH is not an absolute contraindication to liver resection in Child-Pugh class A cirrhotic patients, but resection of 2 or more segments should not be recommended in patients with PH.
