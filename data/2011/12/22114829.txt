Background:Pyogenic liver abscess and hepatocellular carcinoma are common in Taiwan. We investigated the frequency of, risk factors for, and prognosis of pyogenic liver abscess as the initial manifestation of underlying hepatocellular carcinoma over a 12-year period in Taiwan.Methods:We extracted 32,454 patients with pyogenic liver abscess from a nationwide health registry in Taiwan during the period 1997-2008. The frequency of and risk factors for pyogenic liver abscess as the initial manifestation of underlying hepatocellular carcinoma were determined. The prognosis of these patients was compared with patients with hepatocellular carcinoma but without liver abscess.Results:A total of 698 (2.15%) patients presented with liver abscess as the initial manifestation of underlying hepatocellular carcinoma during the 12-year period. Liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection, and age â‰¥65 years were independent risk factors for liver abscess as the initial manifestation of underlying hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, these patients had a lower 2-year survival rate than patients with hepatocellular carcinoma but without liver abscess (30% vs 37%; P=.004).Conclusions:The prognosis of patients who presented with pyogenic liver abscess as the initial manifestation of underlying hepatocellular carcinoma was poor. Physicians should not ignore the possibility of underlying hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with risk factors for the disease in regions with a high prevalence of both pyogenic liver abscess and hepatocellular carcinoma.
