Background/aims:This study was performed to evaluate whether the prevalence rates of primary antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) isolates and the eradication rate of H. pylori could be different between cancer and non-cancer patients.Methods:H. pylori were isolated from gastric mucosal biopsy specimens obtained from 269 Koreans, who did not have any eradication therapy history and were diagnosed as one of the following diseases; chronic gastritis, benign gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer or gastric cancer. The susceptibilities of the H. pylori isolates to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were examined with the agar dilution method. In addition, eradication rate of H. pylori was evaluated.Results:There was no significant difference in the primary antibiotic resistance to above eight antibiotics among chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Furthermore there was no difference of antibiotic resistance between cancer and non-cancer patients, and there was no difference of eradication rate of H. pylori according to disease.Conclusions:Primary antibiotic resistance and H. pylori eradication rate were not different between cancer and non-cancer patients.
