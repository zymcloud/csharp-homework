This study on the treatment of kidney tumor metastases aims to expose our experience in different interventional therapies for renal cell carcinomas metastasis in different organs, broaching their complications and comparing our results with the literature. In the last 5 years, after informed consent, 22 patients with metastatic kidney tumors were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. According to lesion sites, different interventional procedures may be performed: RFA for pancreas, lung, adrenal gland and liver lesions; TAE and RFA for bone lesions and IVC filter positioning for thrombosis of renal vein. There were mainly satisfactory results: complete necrosis of pancreas, lung and adrenal gland metastasis with a technical success rate of 100%; after TAE and RFA of bone lesions, an acceptable blood loss was registered during surgical intervention; no recurrences after liver metastasis ablation were observed in a period of 3 months; positioning of IVC filter was technically correct in 100% of patients; few complications, such as diffuse abdominal pain for pancreas, pneumothorax in the lung RCC metastasis and a post-RFA syndrome for the adrenal. There was a nodular recurrence along the ablation margin in one liver RCC metastasis. Inclusion criteria were relatively strict and only 22 patients were included in this study. The follow-up has been relatively short to date, so we are not certain of the long-term results, though these are comparable to those found in literature. It is possible to conclude that Interventional radiology plays an important role in RCC metastasis treatment, if we have few complications and improved outcomes.
