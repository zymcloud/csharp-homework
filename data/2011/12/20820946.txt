In addition, a number of metabolic diseases of the liver are associated with the development of HCC.Pathophysiologic mechanisms:The mechanisms responsible for the progression of the metabolic liver disease and HCC differ from those associated with viral liver disease.Conclusions:The purpose of this report is to describe the mechanisms responsible for the disease progression and HCC in case of metabolic liver disease. A secondary goal is to identify the frequency of HCC development in the disorders described.
