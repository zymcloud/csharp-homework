Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly complex cancer, resistant to commonly used treatments and new therapeutic agents are urgently needed. A total of thirty-two thieno[3,2-b]pyridine derivatives of two series: methyl 3-amino-6-(hetero)arylthieno[3,2-b]pyridine-2-carboxylates (1a-1t) and methyl 3-amino-6-[(hetero)arylethynyl]thieno[3,2-b]pyridine-2-carboxylates (2a-2n), previously prepared by some of us, were evaluated as new potential anti-HCC agents by studying their in vitro cell growth inhibition on human HepG2 cells and hepatotoxicity using a porcine liver primary cell culture (PLP1). The presence of amino groups linked to a benzene moiety emerges as the key element for the anti-HCC activity. The methyl 3-amino-6-[(3-aminophenyl)ethynyl]thieno[3,2-b]pyridine-2-carboxylate (2f) is the most potent compound presenting GI(50) values on HepG2 cells of 1.2 μM compared to 2.9 μM of the positive control ellipticine, with no observed hepatotoxicity (PLP1 GI(50) > 125 μM against 3.3 μM of ellipticine). Moreover this compound changes the cell cycle profile of the HepG2 cells, causing a decrease in the % of cells in the S phase and a cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. QSAR studies were also performed and the correlations obtained using molecular and 1D descriptors revealed the importance of the presence of amino groups and hydrogen bond donors for anti-HCC activity, and hydrogen bond acceptors for hepatotoxicity. The best correlations were obtained with 3D descriptors belonging to different subcategories for anti-HCC activity and hepatotoxicity, respectively. These results point to different molecular mechanisms of action of the compounds in anti-HCC activity and hepatotoxicity. This work presents some promising thieno[3,2-b]pyridine derivatives for potential use in the therapy of HCC. These compounds can also be used as scaffolds for further synthesis of more potent analogs.
