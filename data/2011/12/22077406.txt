The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of gemcitabine in dogs diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Eighteen dogs were examined retrospectively (4 massive HCC, 10 nodular HCC and 4 diffuse HCC). All dogs received gemcitabine at 350-400 mg m(-2) weekly for 5 weeks. Toxicity was graded using VCOG-CTCAE guidelines and response was monitored with serial abdominal ultrasounds. Fifteen dogs completed all five cycles. Toxicity was minimal and consisted of grade I/II vomiting, anorexia and diarrhoea and two episodes of grade III neutropenia. Median survival time for all dogs was 983 days. Median progression free interval was 971 days. Based on the results of this study, surgery remains the best treatment for HCC, despite incomplete resection. There was no improvement in the survival of those diagnosed with nonresectable HCC treated with gemcitabine chemotherapy.
