Background:Compliance problems have arisen due to the twice a day administration of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). We examined the safety, indications, and efficacy in terms of graft and patient survivals after conversion from tacrolimus to sirolimus or advagraf.Patients and methods:Between January 2006 and December 2009, 36 orthotopic liver transplantation patients underwent conversion of the immunosuppressive regimen from prograf to either sirolimus (group 1; n=10) or advagraf (group 2; n=26). A group of patients taking prograf was used as a control group (group 3; n=15). We identified 51 patients of mean age 57 years and male:female percentages of 57%:43% from a prospective database. Renal and liver graft functions, patient survival, as well as laboratory and clinical data over at least 12 months (mean, 38) were the investigated parameters.Results:Patients converted to sirolimus did not show significantly improved renal function at 12 months as evidenced by creatinine levels (1.31 mg/dL+/-0.47 vs 1.34 mg/dL+/-0.78) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR, 57+/-16 vs 56+/-16 mL/min). However, there were significant antiproliferative effects. Patients with a hepatocellular carcinoma in the pretransplantation phase remained without a recurrence. The side effects including ankle edema, aphthae, and tachyarrhythmia absoluta, required reconversion to the CNI. Patients prescribed advagraf reported a better life quality because of the single administration and a slight, insignificant improvement in renal function. An acute rejection episode was evidenced under either immunosuppresant.Conclusion:Sirolimus is a safe immunosuppressive option in liver transplant recipients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma. Advagraf showed a lower incidence of side effects than prograf and probably is not as harmful for renal function, offering better compliance and better life quality.
