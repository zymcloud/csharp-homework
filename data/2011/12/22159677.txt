Objectives:To describe the computed tomography (CT) features in patients with biopsy-proven hepatic metastases of uveal melanoma and correlate these findings with survival.Methods:The medical records of patients with uveal melanoma evaluated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from January 1998 to September 2009 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were biopsy-proven liver metastasis and CT scan images available within 2 months of biopsy. Exclusion criteria were prior systemic or liver-directed therapy for uveal melanoma. Statistical analyses were carried out using the t test, Ï‡(2) test, and Kaplan-Meier log-rank analyses.Results:Of 505 medical records reviewed, 76 were selected for study. Characteristic CT findings included multiple (68 patients [90%]), hypodense (100%), heterogeneous (100%), and enhancing (100%) hepatic lesions with a mean dominant lesion size of 46.8 cm(2). Eighteen patients (24%) exhibited hepatomegaly. Predominant lesion size larger than 100 cm(2), hepatomegaly, and ascites correlated with a lower survival rate (P = .008, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). Radiographic evidence of extrahepatic metastases was present in 40 patients (53%). However, the presence of extrahepatic metastases did not affect survival. The results of at least 1 liver function test were abnormal in 46 of 67 patients (69%), and elevation of at least 1 serum transaminase and elevation of alkaline phosphatase were associated with larger lesions (P = .009 and P = .004, respectively) and hepatomegaly (P < .001 for both).Conclusions:Radiographic evidence of predominant lesion size larger than 100 cm(2), hepatomegaly, and ascites-but not radiographic evidence of extrahepatic metastases-correlate with a lower survival rate in patients with biopsy-proven hepatic metastases of uveal melanoma.
