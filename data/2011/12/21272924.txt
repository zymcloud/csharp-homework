Thy1/CD90 is an important marker of many types of stem cells. It functions as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer and in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In this study, the expression status of Thy1 in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples was investigated. Relationships of Thy1 expression with clinical parameters and patient survival rate were analyzed. The quantities of Thy1 mRNA were statistically higher in tumor tissues than those in the adjacent non-tumor tissues (p
