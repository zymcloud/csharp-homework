Serum response factor (SRF) regulates tran-scription of immediate early genes and triggers proliferation, migration and differentiation in several types of cells. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, play a crucial role in tumor invasion and metastasis. However, expression of SRF and its association with MMPs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been elucidated. We examined the expression levels of SRF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in HCC tissues using Western blot assay. We also examined the effect of SRF on MMP expression and enzyme activity in HCC by transfection of SRF cDNA in HLE cells. Protein expression of SRF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 showed a significant increase in HCC tissues, compared with those of corresponding non-tumor tissues. High SRF expressing HCC tissues showed higher levels of expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, compared with low SRF expressing HCC tissues. In addition, overexpression of SRF in HLE cells led to increased levels of expression of mRNA and protein, as well as increased enzyme activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Overexpression of SRF also led to significantly enhanced migration of HLE cells. These results suggest that overexpression of SRF in HCC may play an important role in tumor cell migration and invasion through upregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
