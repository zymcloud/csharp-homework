Objective:Laboratory findings demonstrate anticancer effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, including anti-angiogenic activity and inhibition of liver cancer growth in rodent models. Small studies in humans indicate potential for therapeutic anticancer effects and warrant further larger studies.Methods:A case-control study using the General Practice Research Database examined whether prior ACE inhibitor usage was associated with a reduction in incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:Two hundred twenty-four HCC cases were identified, each matched to up to 10 controls by age, sex, and general practice. The data show that HCC is associated with a small, nonsignificant increase in prior use of ACE inhibitors (OR = 1.16, CI = 0.67-2.00). ACE inhibitor use was 7.1% (of 224) in cases and 5.9% (of 2,313) in controls. No significant effects were found when investigating the effect of dose and exposure duration.Conclusions:We found no clear protective effect of ever or long term use of ACE inhibitors against the development of HCC. Our study suggests that it is unlikely that this class of drugs will be a clinically useful cancer chemoprevention therapy.
