Purpose:We evaluated the effects of the combination of Tirapazamine (TPZ), activated preferentially under hypoxic conditions, and gelatin microspheres (GMS) on the tumor growth ratio in rabbits.Methods:We assigned 20 liver tumor-bearing Japanese white rabbits to 4 equal groups. Group 1 received 1 ml of saline intra-arterially (i.a.) and 20 ml of saline intraperitoneally (i.p.; saline group). Group 2 was injected with GMS i.a. and 20 ml saline i.p. (GMS group). Group 3 received 1 ml of saline i.a. and 300 mg/m(2) of TPZ i.p. (TPZ group), and group 4 was treated with GMS i.a. and 300 mg/m(2) of TPZ i.p. (GMS + TPZ group). The infusion of GMS was stopped when the blood flow stagnated. Before and 7 days after treatment, the liver tumor volumes were measured as the total number of pixels on 0.3Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.Results:The tumor growth ratio (mean ± standard deviation) of the saline, GMS, TPZ, and GMS + TPZ groups was 519.15 ± 93.78, 279.24 ± 91.83, 369.78 ± 95.73, and 119.87 ± 17.62, respectively. The difference between the GMS + TPZ group and the other groups was statistically significant (P Conclusions:Our results show that the combination of TPZ i.p. and GMS i.a. enhanced the antitumor effect of TPZ. This procedure may represent a new alternative treatment for patients with hepatic cell carcinoma.
