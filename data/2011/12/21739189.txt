Miriplatin is an anticancer platinum complex for treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas by intra-hepatic arterial injection suspended in an iodinated ethyl ester of fatty acids from poppy seed oil as a carrier. Effects of liver and kidney function on( 14)C-miriplatin pharmacokinetics were assessed using dog models of hepatic and renal impairment introduced by thioacetamide exposure and 7/8 nephrectomy, respectively. Miriplatin was selectively delivered to the liver; platinum and radioactive component were gradually released into systemic circulation and excreted into urine. Microautoradiographic analysis of liver specimens showed( 14)C-miriplatin to be localized in blood vessels and/or macrophage-like cells. These features of miriplatin disposition were not affected by hepatic impairment. Thus, in clinical settings, hepatic impairment would not be expected to affect the intra-hepatic distribution and systemic pharmacokinetics of miriplatin. In dogs with renal impairment, although inconclusive, plasma concentrations of ultrafilterable platinum and radioactivity increased due to reduction in renal clearance.
