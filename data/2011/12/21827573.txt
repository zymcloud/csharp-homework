We present a rare case of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) producing ovarian clear cell carcinoma. This is the first report of a clear cell ovarian carcinoma with hepatoid carcinoma arising from endometriosis. A 54-year-old menopausal woman had a primary ovarian carcinoma of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIc. Serum level of AFP was 4195 ng/mL. Histological examination revealed clear cell adenocarcinoma arising from endometriosis with hepatoid carcinoma. Metastatic liver and lymph node tumors were found after 25 months from the first surgery. However, the patient's serum AFP was within normal limits. The recurrent and metastatic tumors disappeared in response to combined liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin chemotherapy. She has had a disease-free survival of 4 years. In conclusion, the patient had a clear cell ovarian carcinoma with hepatoid carcinoma arising clearly from endometriosis. The recurrent tumors did not show a component of hepatoid carcinoma. Therefore, it is possible to expect better survival with good sensitivity to chemotherapy.
