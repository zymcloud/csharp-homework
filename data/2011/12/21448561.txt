The investigated data shows that arsenic (As) in drinking water is associated with increased mortality from different types of cancers including liver cancer. In this study, blood and scalp hair samples of male liver cancer patients and healthy referents belonging to As exposed areas of Sindh Pakistan were analyzed for As contents. The As levels in drinking water of understudy area showed that sections of this population was exposed to 3-15-folds higher concentrations of As than permissible limit. For comparative purposes, blood and scalp hair samples of matched cancerous patient as referent patients belonging to big city (Hyderabad) who have used municipal treated water with low As levels <10 Î¼g/L were also collected. The results of this study showed that the average As concentration was higher in the blood and scalp hair of exposed and non-exposed referent cancer patients as compared to referents (p < 001). The exposed cancerous patients have twofolds higher As level in both biological samples as related to non-exposed case matched cancerous male subjects.
