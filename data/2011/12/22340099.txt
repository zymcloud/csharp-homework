Objective:To investigate the significance of increasing circulating immune complex (CIC) in patients during the progression from chronic hepatitis B to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Serum levels of CIC from 20 hospitalized patients diagnosed by pathology with primary HCC, and 13 with hepatic hemangioma, and from 45 subjects with chronic HBV infection who finally developed into HCC (45 cases), and age- and gender-matched 45 subjects who kept the chronic HBV infection after consecutively followed up for 10 - 13 years by June of 2009 were quantified by ELISA. The serum levels of anti liver-kidney microsomal (anti LKM-1) antibodies were also measured by ELISA, and that of HBV-DNA were quantified by Taqman probe-based real time PCR in the followed up chronic HBV infection subjects. In the 45 chronic HBV subjects who finally developed into HCC and the 45 controls, serum samples were collected and determined at 3 time points: the baseline when the subjects were recruited, the middle point during the follow-up, and the end of follow-up.Results:The serum level of CIC was significantly higher in the 20 HCC patients than that in the 13 hemangioma cases (P Conclusion:Progressive increase of serum CIC level may be one of risk factors reflecting HCC development from chronic HBV infection.
