Background:Locoregional treatments represent a good option for patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not eligible for resection or transplantation. Locoregional approaches include a wide spectrum of therapeutic methods and hepatic intra-arterial drug infusion is also considered. Fotemustine is a chemotherapy drug usually administered intravenously according to standard administration schedules. Interferon alpha 2b (IFNα2b), a biological response modifier conventionally administered by a systemic route, has been employed in the treatment of both virus-related hepatitis and HCC. Nonetheless, both drugs can also be infused into the hepatic artery.Patients and methods:We report on five patients with liver cancer, not suitable for conventional therapies, treated with hepatic intra-arterial administration of fotemustine in combination with IFNα2b. They received fotemustine at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) and IFNα2b at a starting dose of 2,000,000 IU (increasing up to 3,000,000 IU for subsequent administrations) weekly for three consecutive weeks, followed by two weeks of rest.Results:Among the patients suffering from HCC, the first patient showed a partial response, two patients had almost stable disease and one patient was not assessable. A patient with an intrahepatic biliary tract cancer experienced disease progression.Conclusion:The therapeutic regimen used showed acceptable tolerability profiles and lack of life-threatening side-effects. Further evaluation with a larger patient cohort will be required to clarify if fotemustine and IFNα2b administered into the hepatic artery could be beneficial in treating patients with HCC.
