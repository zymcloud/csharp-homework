Objective:To investigate clinical outcome of surgical treatment for spinal metastatic tumors.Methods:Thirty-six patients with metastatic spine tumors treated surgically were retrospectivly reviewed from September 2005 to August 2010. There were 15 males and 21 females with an average age of 58 years old (ranged, 27 to 79 years). The site of origin of primary cancer included the breast, prostate, colon, lung, liver, esophagus, kidney, carcinoma, bladder, and 10 patients were with unidentified primary cancer. Five lesions were located in the cervical spine, 17 in the thoracic spine, 13 in the lumbar spine and 1 in the sacral vertebrae. Preoperative evaluation was conducted according to Tokuhashi system: total score 0 to 8 in 9 cases, 9 to 11 in 25 cases, 12 to 15 in 2 cases. The surgical procedures, including PVP, tumor resection and decompression, titanium nets implant, artificial vertebra replacement, bone cement stuffiness and inter fixation, were performed based on Tokuhashi score, location of lesions and neurological symptoms.Results:All the patients were followed up, and the during ranged from 2 months to 60 months with a mean time of 10.8 months. Pain relief was obtained in all patients after operation, and the VAS pain scores declined after operation. Among 14 patients suffering from spinal cord and nerve compromise, 12 patients improved 1 to 2 grades after surgery according to the Frankel grading system. According to the system of the ECOG performance status: 28 patients improved 1 to 2 grades in performance status after surgery. The postoperative survival rates at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years were 97.2%, 63.9%, 38.9% and 16.7% respectively. Six patines had bone cement leakage after PVP, and none resulted in severe complications.Conclusion:According to single or multiple spinal metastases, neurological symptoms, spinal stability and patients' condition, the different surgical treatments can be selected for spinal metastatic patients, which can relieve pain, maintain or improve the neurological status, improve quality of life, improve survival rate of patients.
