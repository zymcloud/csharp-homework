In the past two decades, hepatic surgery has achieved important technical breakthroughs resulting in a drastic reduction of the onset of complications and in an improved post-resective survival. Pre-operative nutritional status is one of the key points for the success of a liver resection. Modern surgical achievement such as the development of living-related liver donation, and the possibility to perform more laparoscopic liver resection gave us the opportunity to extend post-operative protocol focused on early intestinal feeding to tumor patients. The aims of this review were to report the current status of the knowledge regarding nutritional aspects in liver resection patients.
