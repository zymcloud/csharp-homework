In a recent issue of Cell, Iliopoulos and colleagues demonstrate a novel and targetable epigenetic amplification loop in hepatocellular carcinoma involving HNF4Î±, miR-124, IL6-R, Stat3, miR-24, and miR-629. These results establish microRNAs as novel players in early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis and as potential targets for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
