We describe here the purification and characterization of a new Phaseolus vulgaris lectin that exhibits selective toxicity to human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and lacks significant toxicity on normal liver WRL 68 cells. This polygalacturonic acid-specific lectin (termed BTKL) was purified from seeds of P. vulgaris cv. Blue tiger king by liquid chromatography techniques. The 60-kDa dimeric lectin showed strong and broad-spectrum hemagglutinating activity toward human, rabbit, rat, and mouse erythrocytes. Bioinformatic analysis unveils substantial N-terminal sequence similarity of BTKL to other Phaseolus lectins. Among a number of tumor cells tested, BTKL exhibits potent anti-Hep G2 activity which is associated with (1) induction of DNA fragmentation, (2) production of apoptotic bodies and chromatin condensation, (3) triggering of cell apoptosis and necrosis, and (4) depolarization of mitochondrial membrane (low ΔΨm). Furthermore, BTKL could induce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and subsequent nitric oxide production in vitro in mouse macrophages, which may contribute to its antitumor activity. In addition, BTKL could bring about a significant dose-dependent increase in the production of mRNAs of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon-gamma. In sum, the antitumor activity and mechanism of BTKL provided here suggest that it has potential therapeutic value for human liver cancer.
