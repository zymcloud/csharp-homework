Purpose:To evaluate the limitations and the feasibility of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for the assessment of tumor response shortly after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Materials and methods:Fifty seven patients (41 patients with hepatomas, 16 patients with metastases) were studied with CEUS before, 1 day after, and 30 days after TACE. A CEUS-efficiency score (CEUS-ES) was calculated, which evaluated: (a) the completeness of visualization of the target tumor(s) (2: good, 1: adequate, 0: poor) and (b) the quality of delineation of post-TACE necroses (2: good, 1: adequate, 0: poor). A CEUS study was considered as "diagnostic," if each of the aforementioned parameters was associated with grade 1 or 2.Results:CEUS studies were "diagnostic" in 36/57 patients (63.1%). Patients with hepatomas were more likely to undergo "diagnostic" CEUS than patients with metastases (70.7% vs. 43.7%, P = 0.0728). Lesions' multiplicity, deep location, hypoenhancement on pretreatment CEUS, and diffuse growth had a statistically significant (P < 0.05) negative impact on CEUS-ES. Hyperechogenicity on pre-treatment, unenhanced US had a non-statistically significant (P = 0.176) negative impact. Differences between "diagnostic" CEUS studies and CT/MR regarding detection of residual tumor were insignificant (P = 0.8178).Conclusion:The percentage of lesions which are unsuitable for post-TACE evaluation with CEUS is not negligible. For the rest, the respective role of CEUS is promising.
