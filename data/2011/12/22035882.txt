This commentary is written in response to a recent Cochrane Collaboration review published in March 2011 (1). The authors of this commentary would like to express their concerns over the conclusions of the Cochrane review, which state, "There is no firm evidence to support or refute transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial embolization (TAE) for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)."
