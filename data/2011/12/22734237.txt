Objective:To analyze the gene expression level of fibroblast activation protein in HBV related hepatocellular carcinoma patients and discuss its clinical significance.Methods:FAP gene expression in 33 hepatocellular carcinoma patients cancer tissues, peficancerous tissues, distant relative normal liver tissues and 13 normal liver tissues were examined by reverse transcription PCR; and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify their expression.Results:FAP were expressed in all the tissues,the relative expression values in cancer tissues, peficancerous tissues and distant relative normal liver tissues were 5.14 +/- 6.69, 1.58 +/- 0.96, 1.63 +/- 0.94, respectively, the differences were statistically significant (F = 4.401, P Conclusion:FAP may play an important role in the occurrence and development of HBV related hepatocellular carcinoma.
