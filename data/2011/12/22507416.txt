Background:Right or left trisectionectomy represents the most extensive and difficult type of hepatic resection, and carries an unfavourably high morbidity and mortality. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of trisectionectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From January 2000 to December 2008, 35 patients with HCC were treated with trisectionectomy. The treatment outcomes of these patients were retrospectively analysed.Results:Twenty-three right and 12 left trisectionectomies were performed. The overall operative morbidity and mortality were 42.8% (n= 15) and 2.8% (n= 1), respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 82.9%, 51.4% and 23.8%, while the 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 71.4%, 42.9% and 12.9%, respectively.Conclusions:With careful patient selection and meticulous surgical technique, trisectionectomy can be performed safely and is associated with long-term survival in a subset of patients with HCC.
