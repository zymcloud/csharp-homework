Background:Alcohol is a significant risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, no rodent model has demonstrated the formation of hepatic neoplasia in the setting of chronic alcohol consumption alone.Methods:We investigated whether rats selectively bred for high alcohol preference (P rats), allowed free access to water, or water and 10% (v/v) alcohol, for 6, 12, or 18 months, develop hepatic neoplasia.Results:At necropsy, liver tumor incidence and multiplicity were significantly increased in 18-month alcohol-consuming versus water-consuming P rats. These data were confirmed histologically by glutathione-S-transferase pi-class (GSTp) staining. Phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MAPK/ERK) staining was also increased in the sinusoidal lining cells within livers of alcohol-consuming versus water only P rats. In addition, cytochrome p450IIE1 (CYP2E1) mRNA, protein expression/activity, and intrahepatic oxidative stress were significantly increased in alcohol-consuming P rat livers versus water only. In contrast, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase expression decreased in alcohol-consuming versus water only P rats. No significant difference in alcohol dehydrogenase expression was detected.Conclusions:These data demonstrate that chronic alcohol consumption is associated with hepatic neoplasia, MAPK/ERK activation, increased CYP2E1 activity, and intrahepatic oxidative stress in P rats. As these rats are well characterized as a model of alcoholism, these findings identify a novel rodent model of alcohol or "alcoholism"-induced liver neoplasia.
