Objective:To evaluate the curative effect of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and hepatic resection (RES) for small hepatocarcinoma eligible for Milan criterion using meta analysis method.Methods:Retrieved clinical trials comparing percutaneous radiofrequency ablation with RES for small hepatocarcinoma published from 1990 to 2010. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate overall survival and disease free survival. A fixed random effect model or random effect model was established to collect the data.Results:Four randomized controlled trials were included in this analysis. These studies included a total of 539 patients: 252 treated with percutaneous RFA and 287 treated with RES. The differences in overall survival were not statistically significant between RFA and RES (P > 0.05). In the patients treated with RES group, the 2-, 3- and 4-years disease free survival rates were significantly better than that in the patients treated with percutaneous RFA (P Conclusions:For small hepatocarcinoma eligible for Milan criterion, percutaneous RFA had a similar overall survival to RES. Percutaneous RFA was the invasive lesser and had a lower postoperative morbidity rate than RES, but RES may had a better prevention of the tumor recurrence than percutaneous RFA. For those patients who don't want to be treated by RES, percutaneous RFA may be a recommendable choice.
