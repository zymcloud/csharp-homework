Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) is a glycoprotein involved in a number of biologic processes. To investigate the expression of ECM1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and determine its correlation with tumor progression and prognosis, the expression levels of ECM1 in three HCC and one normal liver cell lines, tumor, and corresponding adjacent tissues from 18 HCC patients were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry assay was used to determine the expression of ECM1 in HCC and corresponding paracarcinomatous tissues from 77 patients. The results of Western blotting were consistent with the results from RT-PCR analysis of ECM1 mRNA expression. Among the four cell lines, the expression level in HCCLM3, which with the highest metastatic potential, was significantly higher than that with lower (P
