Purpose:Although laparoscopic liver resection has been widely adopted, performing a pure laparoscopic right hepatectomy remains a challenging procedure. The aim of this report is to evaluate the efficiency of a pure laparoscopic right hepatectomy (PLRH) in the semi-prone position using the intrahepatic Glissonian approach and a modified hanging maneuver.Methods:Pure laparoscopic right hepatectomy was performed in the semi-prone position with the use of an intrahepatic Glissonian approach and modified hanging maneuver for patients with primary liver cancer (n = 3) and metastatic liver cancer (n = 1).Results:The intraoperative total blood loss was only 95-140 g (mean: 126.2 g). None of the patients required a blood transfusion, and no serious complications were encountered. The durations of the surgeries ranged from were 308 to 445 min (mean: 394.8 min). The postoperative hospital stay was 8-11 days (mean 9.5 days).Conclusion:Pure laparoscopic right hepatectomy in the semi-prone position using the intrahepatic Glissonian approach and a modified hanging maneuver is thus considered to be a safe modality, which minimizes intraoperative bleeding.
