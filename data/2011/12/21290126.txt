Purpose:To evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness of foam sclerotherapy using polidocanol for preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) before hemihepatectomy of the liver.Materials and methods:From March 2006 to October 2008, foam sclerotherapy using polidocanol was performed in 16 patients (male-to-female ratio of 12:4, age range 48-75 years [mean 62]) for PVE. Patients were diagnosed with Klatskin tumor (n = 13), gallbladder (GB) cancer (n = 2), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n = 1). The foam was composed of a 1:2:1 ratio of 3% polidocanol (Aethoxysklerol; Kreussler Pharma, Wiesbaden, Germany), room air, and contrast media (Xenetix 350; Guerbet, Aulnay-Sous-Bois, France). The total amount of polidocanol used (2 to 8 mL [mean 4.6]) varied according to the volume of the target portal vein. We calculated the volume of future liver remnant (FLR) before and after PVE and evaluated complications associated with the use of polidocanol foam sclerotherapy for PVE.Results:Technical success was achieved in all patients. All patients were comfortable throughout the procedure and did not experience pain during sclerotherapy. No periprocedural morbidity or mortality occurred. Patients underwent a liver dynamic computed tomography (CT) scan 2-4 weeks after PVE. FLR increased significantly after PVE using polidocanol foam from 19.3% (range 16-35%) before PVE to 27.8% (range 23-42%) after PVE (p = 0.001). All patients were operable for hemihepatectomy of the liver and achieved effective resection.Conclusion:Foam sclerotherapy using polidocanol is clinically safe and effective for preoperative PVE.
