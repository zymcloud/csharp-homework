Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) directly invading the gastrointestinal (GI) organs is rare and is associated with poor survival outcome. We report two patients with good long-term outcome following resection of HCC that invaded the stomach and duodenum, respectively. A literature review was conducted to elucidate the course of patients with this pathology. Two cases (57-year-old and 72-year-old males) with enlarged hepatic tumors directly invading the stomach and duodenum underwent hepatectomies with en-bloc resection of the involved organs. Both patients are still alive at 80 and 68 months following the surgery. Our literature review showed that most of the patients with this pathology have manifested, and died of persistent GI bleeding. Patients who were treated surgically had a statistically significant longer survival than those who were treated with non-surgical palliative treatments (P
