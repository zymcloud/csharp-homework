Nonsurgical therapies have become treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was to evaluate the efficacy and complications of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment for patients with HCC. Between May 2001 and May 2005, 145 patients with HCC were enrolled for treatments using a HIFU tumor therapeutic system. Clinical symptoms, hepatic functions and values of serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) were tested before and after HIFU treatment. The changes in computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), complications and survival time after HIFU were also obtained for further analysis. Symptoms improved or pain was relieved in 84.8% of the 145 patients and the rate of serum AFP decrease was 71.7%. The size of the target tumor shrank by various degrees. The 2-year survival rate was 80% in patients with stage Ib HCC, 51.4% in stage IIa and 46.5% in stage IIIa. During HIFU treatment, complications included body temperature increase and abnormal cardiac rhythm. After HIFU procedures, there were skin burns of different grades. In conclusion, HIFU is safe and effective for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma; HIFU can improve the survival quality of patients with HCC.
