The aim of the research was the analysis of metastasis in patients with thyroid carcinoma in Armenia in 1999-2011. Case histories of 529 patients with thyroid cancer from 1999-2011 were investigated. It was found that the prognostic value of regional metastases differs considerably. In cases of differentiated carcinomas the regional metastases are not regarded as a significant factor of the prognosis, because the majority of the affected lymph nodes is removed by the qualified surgeons during the operation, and the others (not revealed or micrometastases), due to ability to accumulate radio iodine, can be liquidated in the postoperative course of radio iodine therapy. The prognosis is less favorable in regional metastasizing at patients with other types of thyroid cancer. Almost the half of the patients who have died because of thyroid carcinoma had the regional and distant metastases. The index of metastasis in thyroid cancer in rural settlements is higher, than in urban in Armenia. The frequency of metastasizing is higher in elderly patients.
