Purpose:Spisulosine is a marine compound that showed antitumor activity in preclinical studies. We report results of a phase I trial performed in patients with advanced solid tumors with the marine compound, with the aim to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a weekly 3-h intravenous (iv.) infusion, and to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the compound.Patients and methods:Two centers contributed 25 patients to the trial, and 7 dose levels were explored.Results:In dose levels ranging from 4 to 128 mg/m²/day, no dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were observed. One patient had DLT at 200 mg/m², a reversible grade 3 ALT increase. The MTD was not reached due to early termination of the Spisulosine trial program but is considered to be likely in the range of 200 mg/m² for this schedule. Drug-related adverse reactions included mild to moderate nausea, pyrexia, injection site reactions, and vomiting. One case of grade 4 peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy associated with general weakness and pain was observed during treatment cycle 4 and possibly contributed to the death of the patient. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities included anemia and lymphopenia and increases in liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, transaminases, and bilirubin). Objective responses were not observed, and only four patients had short-lasting stable disease (<3 months). The PK data indicated a wide distribution, a long residence time, and dose proportionality of the agent.Conclusions:Hepato- and neuro-toxicity are schedule independent dose-limiting adverse events for this marine compound, as illustrated by this and other early clinical trials.
