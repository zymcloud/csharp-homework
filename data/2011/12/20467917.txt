In medical terminology, spontaneous regression of cancer refers to exceptional and unexplained partial or complete disappearance of cancer without medical intervention. This phenomenon has been described in various malignancies with no well established causative factors, except perhaps immune mediated. Here we present a rare case of hepatocellular carcinoma with possible metastasis to the lung by computed tomography with complete regression of both the primary tumor and the pulmonary nodules without medical intervention. Our patient may represent the first case of complete regression of the HCC with possible lung metastasis by computed tomography caused by abstinence from alcohol. This phenomenon was confirmed by surgical resection and pathologic evaluation.
