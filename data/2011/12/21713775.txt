Background:Hepatectomy is one of the best curative therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The negative impact of postoperative complications on long-term survival has been investigated in patients with several kinds of cancers. To clarify the impact of postoperative complications on long-term survival in patients who undergo hepatectomy for HCC, we conducted a comparative analysis of 376 patients using the modified Clavien classification and identified the predictors of postoperative complications.Methods:Patients were assigned into two groups: those with (N = 177) and those without complications (N = 199). The clinical data, surgical outcome, and long-term survival of patients were analyzed retrospectively.Results:The cumulative overall survival rates of the patients with complications were significantly less than those of the patients without complications (P Conclusions:Postoperative complications (major or minor) are one of prognostic indicators in hepatectomy for HCC. The present study suggests that high quality surgical technique to minimize complications will improve the prognosis of HCC.
