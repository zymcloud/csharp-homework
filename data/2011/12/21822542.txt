Liver cancer is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide. Liver YIN deficiency is a common clinical syndrome of traditional Chinese medicine in liver cancer. Yi Guan Jian is an ancient classic liver YIN tonifying herbal formula used for the treatment of liver disease with liver YIN deficiency, which is also currently used for liver cancer treatment. However, as an ancient formula, Yi Guan Jian (YGJ) is not entirely suitable for liver cancer treatment. In the present study, we optimized the prescription of YGJ according to the current principles of Chinese herbal medication, and evaluated the anticancer effects of modified Yi Guan Jian (MYGJ) in Bel-7402 human hepatocarcinoma cells. The results show that MYGJ inhibited the growth of Bel-7402 cells in adherent or in suspension cultures, and was more effective in Bel-7402 cells in suspension. MYGJ also inhibited anchorage-independent growth of Bel-7402 cells in soft agar. MYGJ induced anoikis in Bel-7402 cells accompanied by caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation, which was blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. Furthermore, MYGJ inhibited the expression and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in Bel-7402 cells. These findings suggest that MYGJ is sufficient to induce caspase-mediated anoikis in Bel-7402 cells in vitro, and may be associated with down-regulation of p38 MAPK. The present study also provides insight into the application of ancient Chinese herbal formulas.
