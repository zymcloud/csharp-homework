During the recent few years, microRNAs emerged as key molecules in the regulation of mammalian cell functions. It was also shown that their altered expression can promote pathologic conditions, such as cancer and other common diseases. Because environmental exposure to biological, chemical or physical agents may be responsible for human diseases, including cancer, uncovering relationships between exposure to environmental carcinogens and expression of microRNAs may help to disclose early mechanisms of disease and it may potentially lead to the development of useful indicators of toxic exposure or novel biomarkers for carcinogenicity testing. The unique expression profile of microRNAs in different types and at different stages of cancer coupled to their remarkable stability in tissues and in serum/plasma suggests that these little molecules may find application as sensitive biomarkers. This review will concentrate on the alterations in microRNA expression in response to environmental factors in relation to the risk of developing liver cancer.
