Cerebral lipiodol embolism (CLE) is an extremely rare complication of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma. To our knowledge, only 11 cases have been previously reported. We recently encountered two cases of CLE in our clinical work. Reviewing the 11 cases in the literature and the two cases in our report indicates that large dose lipiodol infusion and absence of particulate embolization should be avoided. The presence of a right-to-left shunt and inferior phrenic artery injection seems to increase the risk of CLE. More caution should be taken in these situations.
