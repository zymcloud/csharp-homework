Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is usually a silent disease that occurs in a very high proportion of people with features of the metabolic syndrome, including overweight, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Because obesity and type 2 diabetes are now extremely common in Westernised societies, it is likely that the prevalence of NAFLD increases markedly in the future. Although previously it was thought that NAFLD was harmless, it is now recognised that NAFLD can be a progressive liver condition that increases risk of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, liver fat accumulation causes insulin resistance and increases risk of type 2 diabetes. Increasing evidence now shows NAFLD is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this review is to briefly discuss the pathogenesis of NAFLD, to describe the relationship between NAFLD and CVD and the mechanisms linking both conditions and to discuss some of the treatment options (including lifestyle, nutrition and drugs) that may influence both NAFLD and risk of CVD.
