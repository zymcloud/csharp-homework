Objective:To investigate the expression of RUNX3 mRNA and protein in hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC) and surrounding normal tissue, to analyze the relationship between RUNX3 expression and clinical pathological parameters.Methods:Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to detect the expression of RUNX3 mRNA and protein in HCC and surrounding normal tissue respectively, and their relationship with clinical pathological parameters were analyzed.Results:The relative expression value of RUNX3 mRNA found in 51 cases HCC was 0.4509 +/- 0.0963, and that did in 51 cases surrounding normal tissue was 0.9147 +/- 0.0222. The difference of RUNX3 mRNA expression between two kinds of samples was statistically significant (t = 33.6087, P 0.05).Conclusion:The expression of RUNX3 mRNA and protein in HCC were significantly lower than that in surrounding normal tissue. The lower expression of runx3 protein in the HCC probably plays an important role in the tumorigenesis and development of HCC. The RUNX3 gene may be an anti-oncogene of HCC.
