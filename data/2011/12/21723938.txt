Amorphous silica nanoparticles are widely applied in many fields. But the adverse effects of silica nanoparticle exposure were unclear. The present study investigated the cytotoxicity and mitochondrial damage of silica nanoparticles exposure in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2). The cells were treated with 43 nm non-modified amorphous silica nanoparticles which dispersed in serum-free DMEM at concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 100 and 200 Î¼g/mL for 3 and 24 h. The results showed that the silica nanoparticles could lead to increasing cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production for 3 and 24 h exposure. Moreover, the oxidative stress induced by the particles could play an important role of the mitochondrial membrane damage and the cell apoptosis. It indicated that apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway mediated by oxidative stress was a potential mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by silica nanoparticles. The particles could enter the cells through different pathways and dispersed in cytoplasm and deposited inside mitochondria. Mitochondria were the major organelles for the cytotoxicity of silica nanoparticles exposure. Mitochondrial damage was related to the oxidative stress and the direct injurious effect of nanoparticles. It can be considered as the potential mechanism for the cytotoxic effects of amorphous silica nanoparticles.
