A simple liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for quantification of sorafenib (Nexavar) in human plasma. After a solid-phase extraction procedure, the separation was performed within 2 minutes using an isocratic flow of a mobile phase consisting of formic acid/acetonitrile applied on a C18 analytical column. The analyte was detected by mass spectrometry in the single-ion monitoring mode. The method was validated according to the recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administration. The method was linear (rÂ² > 0.99) between 10 and 10,000 ng/mL. The lower limits of detection and quantification were 5 and 10 ng/mL, respectively. Within-day and between-day imprecisions were less than 10.4%, and inaccuracy did not exceed 8.7%. The mean extraction recovery was 92.2%. The method also provided satisfactory results in terms of time stability and dilution integrity. Sorafenib plasma concentrations of the studied patient ranged between 1831 and 3459 ng/mL. This new technique is rapid, sensitive, and was applied to the determination of sorafenib plasma concentrations in a patient undergoing hemodialysis. Our results indicate that sorafenib is not cleared from plasma by hemodialysis, although analysis should be delayed after dialysis to avoid erratic fluctuations.
