Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is characterized by a particularly aggressive behavior even many years after resection of primary tumor. The evolution of metastasis dramatically affects the final outcome but resection should always be evaluated. Herein is described a case of aggressive ACC of the parotid gland in a 30-year-old female. She developed local recurrence and lung metastases; then, she also developed two liver metastasis 112 and 132 months after the resection of the primitive cancer of the parotid gland. Both lesions were successfully managed by a laparoscopic approach. Intra-abdominal adhesions after the first surgery were mild, allowing an easier access for the second laparoscopic liver resection. At 1 year follow-up, the patient is liver disease free with a stable lung disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a double laparoscopic liver resection for parotid gland's ACC metachronous metastases. Patients with resected ACC need a strict and lifelong follow-up after the resection of the primitive cancer. Also for ACC, a laparoscopic approach to liver metastasis should always be considered as a viable alternative to open surgery. In our experience of over 90 cases, laparoscopic surgery causes less adhesions, allowing an easier approach for repeated resections.
