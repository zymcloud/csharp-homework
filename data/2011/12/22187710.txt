Small cell carcinoma (SCC) is most commonly found in the lung but is occasionally found in the gastrointestinal tract and other extrapulmonary sites. Incidences of SCC in the esophagus and stomach are rare and have been reported almost exclusively in older individuals. The following case presents the discovery of small cell carcinoma of the stomach and esophagus in a 35 year old woman, which is the youngest reported incidence of this to date. Additionally, her course reflects the importance of early diagnostic endoscopy with biopsy and adequate sampling with appropriate immunohistochemical staining when malignancy is in the differential diagnosis, regardless of age or risk factors.
