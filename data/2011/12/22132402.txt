Aims:To describe the technique and to evaluate the feasibility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound with intraarterial administration of echo-enhancer (i.a CEUS) as a method for guidance of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Patients and methods:Twelve patients with 17 target liver tumors underwent superselective TACE, guided with i.a CEUS. After microcatheter placement in a (sub)segmental artery suspected as a tumor feeder, a diluted suspension of SonoVue was injected through the microcatheter, and imaging of the target tumor was performed with a low mechanical index technique and with contrast-specific software. If intraarterial injection of SonoVue was associated with immediate, strong tumoral enhancement, the injected artery was considered as tumor-feeding and TACE was performed, otherwise another artery was evaluated.Results:From 25 segmental or subsegmental arteries evaluated i.a CEUS confirmed that 16 arteries were actually tumor feeders and unequivocal excluding 4 arteries as a tumor arterial supply. The remainder 5 arterial branches could not be safely characterized due to artifacts or technical limitations. In 8 patients in which tumoral vascular supply could not be elucidated by angiography alone, i.a CEUS increased the accuracy of supereselective embolization, and provided other clinically relevant information in 2 of these patients. No adverse effects were observed.Conclusions:For guidance of superselective TACE i.a CEUS is a safe and feasible method..
