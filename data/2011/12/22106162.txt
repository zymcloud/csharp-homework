Autophagy is a self-digestion process that plays an important role in the development, differentiation and homeostasis of cells, helping their survival during starvation and hypoxia. Accumulated mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum can be degraded by autophagy in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Hepatitis C and B virus may exploit the autophagy pathway to escape the innate immune response and to promote their own replication. Autophagy is decreased in response to chronic alcohol consumption, likely due to a decrease in 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, increase in mTOR activity and due to an alteration in vesicle transport in hepatocytes. In obesity and alcoholic liver disease the decreased function of autophagy causes formation of Mallory-Denk bodies and cell death. The deficient autophagy can contribute to liver steatosis, to endoplasmic reticulum stress, and to progression of liver disease. Autophagy defect in hepatocellular carcinoma suggests that it can serve a tumor-suppressor function. The autophagy protein Beclin-1 levels have prognostic significance in liver tumors. Understanding of the molecular mechanism and the role of autophagy may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies in liver diseases in the future.
