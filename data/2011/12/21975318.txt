Background:The potential benefit of adjuvant hepatic arterial infusional floxuridine (HAI-FUDR) in addition to modern systemic chemotherapy using oxaliplatin or irinotecan remains unknown for patients with resected liver-confined colorectal metastases (CRLM). The principle aim of this study was to compare outcomes in patients receiving modern systemic chemotherapy with or without HAI-FUDR.Methods:Between 2000 and 2005, 125 patients underwent resection of CRLM followed by adjuvant HAI-FUDR plus dexamethasone (Dex) and concurrent systemic chemotherapy including oxaliplatin or irinotecan. These patients were compared retrospectively to 125 consecutive patients who received modern systemic chemotherapy alone after liver resection.Results:The median follow-up for all patients was 43 months. There were no differences in clinical risk score, disease-free interval, size of largest CRLM, number of CRLM, or prehepatectomy CEA level between the 2 groups. Adjuvant HAI-FUDR was associated with an improved overall and liver recurrence-free survival (liver RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). For the adjuvant HAI-FUDR group, the 5-year liver RFS, overall RFS, and DSS were 75%, 48%, and 79%, respectively, compared to 55%, 25%, and 55% for the systemic alone group (P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, adjuvant treatment including HAI-FUDR was independently associated with improved liver RFS (HR = 0.34), overall RFS (HR = 0.65), and DSS (HR = 0.39), P < 0.01.Conclusions:Adjuvant HAI-FUDR combined with modern systemic chemotherapy is independently associated with improved survival compared to adjuvant systemic chemotherapy alone. A randomized clinical trial between these 2 regimens is justified.
