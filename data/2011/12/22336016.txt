Objective:To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of metastatic tumors in nasal cavity and pharynx.Methods:The clinicopathological data of 11 patients was studied retrospectively with a literature review. Among 11 cases, 7 patients were males and 4 females. Ages ranged from 46 to 78 years old. The sites of the metastatic tumor involvement included 5 cases of nasal cavity (3 cases derived from kidney, 1 case from lung, 1 case from liver), 3 cases of nasopharynx (1 case derived from rectum, 1 case from lung, 1 case from eyelid), 2 cases of palatine tonsil (1 case derived from lung, 1 case from liver) and 1 case of laryngopharynx (1 case derived from liver). All cases were lack of specific clinical symptoms related to metastatic sites. The treatment was primarily based on radical metastasectomy and systemic therapy.Results:Histopathologically, clear cell carcinoma was the most common (4/11), followed by adenocarcinoma (2/11), hepatocellular carcinoma (2/11), tubular adenocarcinoma (1/11), intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma (1/11) and eyelid board carcinoma (1/11).Conclusions:The incidence of metastatic tumors in nasal cavity and pharynx is extremely low. The definite diagnosis mainly relies on the history of primary cancer and the morphological characteristics of metastatic tumor. The treatment is primarily based on radical metastasectomy and systemic therapy.
