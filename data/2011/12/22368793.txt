Aim:To construct recombinant plasmid and adenovirus harboring MDA-7 gene, and to investigate its biological function on the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Methods:The MDA-7 fragments from the T vectors were inserted into pCDNA-3 vector to construct expression plasmids named pCDNA3-MDA-7. To determine its effects on the proliferation of HCC cells, transfected the expression vector into cells and tested the ability of colony formation in cancer cells. Simultaneously, constructed recombinant adenovirus expressing MDA-7, and detected its effect on the proliferation of HCC cells by using MTT assay.Results:Successfully constructed plasmid- and adenovirus-based system to express MDA-7. The data of colony formation assay and M'T test showed that MDA-7 can obviously suppress cell growth in HCC cells.Conclusion:MDA-7 may function as tumor suppressor in HCC cells, and the adenovirus-mediated MDA-7 can be a novel strategy for the anti-HCC therapy. Our study established the foundation for future research on the effect of MDA-7 in HCC.
