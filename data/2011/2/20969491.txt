Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common tumor in cirrhotic patients with a median survival of only 8-10 months if untreated. Supraselective transarterial chemoembolization (STACE) is supposed to be a well-established method for treating HCC patients. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of STACE on post-transplant survival in patients with HCC.Material and methods:The charts of 53 HCC patients were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-seven patients had STACE as a bridging therapy while 26 patients were scheduled for liver transplantation (LTX) without prior STACE therapy. A total of 53% of the patients who underwent LTX preoperatively fulfilled the Milan criteria, while 70.6% fulfilled the expanded University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) transplant criteria. Primary endpoint was the post-transplant survival. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier-method, log rank, and chi square tests.Results:Between the LTX groups (STACE vs. non-STACE), there was no significant difference in terms of age, Child classification, Okuda stage, co-morbidities, underlying disease, and post-transplant survival (p > 0.05). Independent of prior STACE, however, disease-free survival after LTX was highly significantly prolonged if LTX was performed within 3 months after initial diagnosis of HCC (p Conclusions:We conclude that STACE performed prior to LTX does not secure any post-transplant survival benefit, while early LTX, i.e. within 3 months after HCC diagnosis, does improve survival regardless of whether STACE was performed or not. Additionally, fulfillment of the expanded transplant UCSF criteria leads to a prolonged post-transplant survival.
