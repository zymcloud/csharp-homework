The approval of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) targeted agent sorafenib as the first effective drug for the systemic treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a milestone in the treatment of this disease. A better understanding of HCC pathogenesis will lead to development of novel targeted treatments. As a typical member of the RTK family, c-Met represents an intriguing target for cancer therapy. The c-Met signaling pathway has been shown to be deregulated and to correlate with poor prognosis in a number of major human cancers. This review discusses the possibility of c-Met as a target in HCC treatment from the following respects: i) c-Met expression and activation profile in HCC, ii) relationship between c-Met and clinicopathologic state and prognosis of HCC, iii) role of c-Met signaling activity in HCC genesis and progression, and iv) strategy of c-Met pathway targeting therapy in HCC treatment.
