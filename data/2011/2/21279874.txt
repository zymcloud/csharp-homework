To study the chemical composition of the skin of Bufo bufo gargarizans, various chromatographic methods were used in the isolation procedures and the structures of isolated compounds were determined based on NMR and MS analysis. As a result, two new compounds were isolated from its ethanolic extract and characterized as N-[2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-N-methylurea (1) and 19-oxocinobufotalin 3-adipoylarginine ester (2), together with 11 known compounds. Isolated bufadienolides showed significant inhibition effect against human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721 in vitro.
