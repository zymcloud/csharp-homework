Purpose:To compare prospectively the effects of radiofrequency (RF) ablation after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with those of RF ablation alone in the treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and all patients gave written informed consent. From January 2002 to December 2006, 139 patients with recurrent HCC measuring 5 cm in diameter or smaller were randomized to receive either sequential TACE and RF ablation (sequential treatment group, n=69) or RF ablation alone (RF ablation group, n=70). The survival curves were constructed with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using the log-rank test. Bonferroni correction was applied when multiple comparisons were performed. PResults:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 94%, 69%, and 46%, respectively, for the sequential treatment group and 82%, 47%, and 36% for the RF ablation group (P=.037). The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates were 80%, 45%, and 40% for the sequential treatment group and 64%, 18%, and 18% for the ablation group (P=.005). At subgroup analyses, the overall survival for the sequential treatment group was better than that for the RF ablation group for patients with tumor recurrence 1 year or less after initial treatment (P=.004) and those with tumors measuring 3.1-5.0 cm (P=.002) but not for those with tumor recurrence more than 1 year after initial treatment (P=.421) and those with tumors 3.0 cm or smaller (P=.478). The recurrence-free survival in the sequential treatment group was better than that in the RF ablation group for patients with tumors measuring 3.1-5.0 cm (PConclusion:The efficacy of sequential TACE-RF ablation is better than that of RF ablation alone for recurrent HCC.
