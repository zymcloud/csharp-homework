This study is to investigate the mechanism underlying the anti-apoptotic effects of freeze-dried grape powder (FDGP) and identify the polyphenolic compounds involved. We examined apoptotic signaling pathways affected by FDGP and by its active components, including epicatechin, cyanidin, quercetin, and resveratrol, in human Huh7 hepatoma cells by assaying cell viability assays, the activities of caspase 3 and caspase 7, and the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated proteins. FDGP dramatically decreased taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA)-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Assessment of individual active components revealed that at concentrations corresponding to 300 μg/mL FDGP, only quercetin demonstrated cytoprotective effects against mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, increased concentrations of other individual polyphenolic compounds were required to produce measurable cytoprotective effect. Only combinations of all four polyphenolic compounds (epicatechin, cyanidin, quercetin, and resveratrol) restored a degree of the anti-apoptotic effects seen with FDGP. The pretreatment of FDGP at 30 μg/mL concentration could reverse the thapsigargin-induced effects on the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated proteins. In conclusion, FDGP reduced oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. The mechanisms involved in the anti-apoptotic effects of FDGP included reduced generation of ROS, and reduced processing of certain caspases. We demonstrated that quercetin, epicatechin, and cyanidin are active compounds within FDGP that attenuate apoptosis. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant effects of grape and are expected to assist in developing clinical protocols to treat a variety of stress-mediated conditions.
