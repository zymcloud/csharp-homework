Objective:To investigate the clinicopathological features, treatment, and prognosis of gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma and gastric carcinoma with neuroendocrine cell differentiation.Methods:A total of 19 patients were treated for gastric neuroendocrine cancer or gastric cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation in the Beijing Cancer Hospital from January 1997 to December 2008. Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed.Results:Fourteen patients had neuroendocrine carcinoma in the gastric cardia (n=9) or gastric body(n=5), and 5 patients had gastric cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation in the gastric cardia(n=2), the antrum(n=2), and the entire stomach(n=1). According to the International Classification of Disease for Oncology(2000), patients were divided into gastric carcinoid type I((n=2, 10.5%), type III( sporadic gastric carcinoid (n=9, 47.4%), small cell carcinoma of the stomach(n=3,15.8%), and gastric cancer with neuroendocrine cell differentiation(n=5, 26.3%). Clinical manifestations were mostly non-specific. Diagnosis was based on pathological and immunohistochemical examination. Eighteen patients underwent surgery including radical subtotal gastrectomy and total gastrectomy, of whom 3 underwent simultaneous resection of the liver metastasis. The remaining one patient with small cell carcinoma of the gastric body received chemotherapy alone because of unresectable liver metastasis. The survival rate was 73.7% at 1 year and 38.6% at 3 years.Conclusions:Gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma usually develops in the cardia and body of the stomach. Gastric carcinoma with neuroendocrine cell differentiation can occur in any locations of the stomach. Immunohistochemistry is important to the diagnosis. Radical resection is the main treatment.
