Objectives:To assess the incidence and degree of MRI contrast enhancement in liver tumours following successful percutaneous cryoablation.Methods:Thirty-eight patients with liver metastases (n = 29) or hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 9) underwent percutaneous cryoablation of 45 tumours between March 2004 and June 2009, with complete ablation zone coverage of the tumour and no local recurrence on follow-up imaging to date (range 3-60 months, mean 16). Contrast-enhanced MRI was used to assess 45 tumours at 24 h, 32 tumours at 2-4 months, and 21 tumours at 5-7 months. Percentage of tumours with contrast enhancement was assessed using dynamic spoiled gradient echo T1-weighted images.Results:Twenty-four hours post-cryoablation, 23 out of 45 tumours (51%) enhanced compared with 42 out of 43 (98%) pre-ablation (p Conclusions:Unlike previously reported studies of radiofrequency ablation, successful cryoablation of liver tumours is often associated with persistent tumour contrast enhancement on MRI performed at 24 h and decreasing over 2-7 months.Key points:• Liver neoplasms often demonstrate MRI contrast enhancement following successful percutaneous cryoablation. • This differs from radiofrequency ablation techniques where contrast enhancement suggests residual tumour • This difference could potentially lead to important errors in follow up strategies.
