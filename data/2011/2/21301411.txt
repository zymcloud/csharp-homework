Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a novel and promising antitumor treatment. Phthalocyanine-mediated PDT has shown antitumor activity in some tumor cells, but the effect of new hydrophilic/lipophilic tetra-α-(4-carboxyphenoxy)phthalocyanine zinc (TαPcZn)-mediated PDT (TαPcZn-PDT) on human hepatocellular carcinoma Bel-7402 cells and underlying mechanisms have not been clarified. In the present study, therefore, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrum and cellular localization of TαPcZn, and effect of TαPcZn-PDT on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, Bcl-2 and Fas in Bel-7402 cells were investigated by spectrophotometry, inverted microscope, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, electron microscopy, annexinV-FITC/propidium iodide double staining, DNA content and immunoblot assay, respectively. We found that an intense absorption in UV-vis absorption spectrum of TαPcZn was in the red visible region at 650-680 nm, where light penetration in tissue is efficient, that green TαPcZn localized to both plasma membrane and nuclear membrane of Bel-7402 cells, signifying that there was a selective uptake of TαPcZn in Bel-7402 cells and TαPcZn-PDT would be expected to directly damage DNA, and that TαPcZn-PDT significantly resulted in the proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, S cell cycle arrest, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Fas. Taken together, we conclude that TαPcZn-PDT inhibits the proliferation of Bel-7402 cells by triggering apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle.
