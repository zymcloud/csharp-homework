In order to demonstrate the role of the pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its value as a molecular target for cancer therapy, we analyzed the expression of PTTG1 mRNA and protein, and their relation to clinicopathological characteristics and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) expression in HCC. It was observed that the level of PTTG1 mRNA and the positive rate of PTTG1 protein in cancerous tissues were significantly higher than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues (both P
