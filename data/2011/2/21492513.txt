To establish a systematic site-specific metastatsis model of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in nude mouse. HCCLM3-R cells were seeded into mice liver to establish xenograft mouse models. With the help of RFP, metastasis foci in lungs and lymph nodes in mice were detected using fluorescent stereomicroscopy and were removed. Cells derived from the metastasis foci were named HCCLM3-R-LM1 and HCCLM3-R-LnM1 respectively. HCCLM3-R-LM1 and HCCLM3-R-LnM1 cells were seeded into mice livers to analyze the lung and lymph node metastasis. Lungs of all tested mice were collected, examined by pathological evaluation and counted lung metastasis. Both lung and lymph node metastasis were found in HCCLM3-R-LM1, HCCLM3-R and HCCLM3-R-LnM1 cells and a significant difference was found between the lung and the lymph node metastasis levels in the three cells. The fluorescent areas (pixels) of lung and lymph node metastasis were 8687.00+/-1844.63 versus 2570.00+/-318.20 (P = 0.0031) in HCCLM3-R-LM1 cells, 6457.67+/-832.62 versus 10 994.33+/-2 212.31 (P = 0.0036) in HCCLM3-R cells, and 2968.67+/-2571.00 versus 24 416.00+/-7 186.13 (P = 0.0094) in HCCLM3-R-LnM1 cells, respectively. The middle numbers of microscopic lung metastatic foci were 775, 430 and 310 in HCCLM3-R-LM1, HCCLM3-R and HCCLM3-R-LnM1 cells (P less than 0.001), respectively, consist with the results quantified by RFP. We established the systematic site-specific metastasis models which demonstrates lung- and lymph node-specific metastasis potential in nude mice and can be used as a model for researches on site-specific metastasis of HCC.
