Background:Injection of a suspension of miriplatin into the hepatic artery has been employed for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using miriplatin were evaluated.Methods:A total of 236 patients with unresectable HCC received miriplatin administration through the hepatic artery, followed by embolization with porous gelatin particles. The efficacy of this treatment modality was evaluated by contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed 1 month later and its safety based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).Results:Miriplatin was used at a median dose of 66 mg. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in 130 patients, and the overall and complete response rates were 70.0 and 37.7%, respectively. The efficacies differed depending on the staging and Japan integrated staging (JIS) scores of the HCCs, with the overall and complete response rates being 87.7 and 66.7% for stage I and stage II HCC, and 56.2 and 15.1% for stage III and stage IV HCC, respectively; the corresponding rates were 93.2 and 70.5%, respectively, for HCCs with score 0 and score 1, and 58.1 and 20.9%, respectively, for those with scores 2-4. The stage of HCC was a significant independent factor associated with curative effects of TACE using miriplatin. Grade 3 elevation of serum transaminase levels was found in 23.4% of the patients; however, the values returned to the baseline levels.Conclusions:Miriplatin is a useful and safe agent for TACE in patients with HCC stage I or II and/or JIS score 0 or 1 only when radiofrequency ablation and liver resection cannot be performed.
