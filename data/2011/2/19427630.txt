Background:Prognosis after resection for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains unsatisfactory. There remains no effective therapy after recurrent ICC.Objective:The current study sought to evaluate risk factors associated with recurrent ICC and possible therapies after resection.Method:A review of data from patients who underwent potentially curative resection for ICC was performed.Results:A total of 44 potentially curative resections were performed from 1995 to 2008. Mortality was 0% and morbidity was 35%. The 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 43% and 39%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified the presence of multiple nodules and poor histologic grade as independent negative prognostic factors for overall and recurrent-free survival. Postoperative recurrence occurred in 25 patients (57%). Solitary recurrence occurred in 5 patients (liver, n = 4; lung, n = 1), all of who had undergone surgical resection. Three of the 5 patients survived for more than 5 years after 2 resections.Conclusion:Prognosis after curative resection of solitary ICC appears favorable. In selected patients with sequential single hepatic or pulmonary recurrence, repeat resection may prolong survival.
