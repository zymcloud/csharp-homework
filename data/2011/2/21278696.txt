Background:Renal cell carcinoma commonly metastasizes to lung, liver, and bone. Small intestinal metastases are exceedingly rare.Case report:A 75-year-old man presented at our hospital with tarry stools. He had undergone a right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 6 years previously; in addition, he had received antiplatelet treatment for ischemic heart disease. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, total colonoscopy, and computed tomography did not identify any cause for the gastrointestinal bleeding. He underwent capsule endoscopy (CE), which revealed an ulcerated submucosal tumor in the jejunum. We performed a double-balloon endoscopy (DBE), and histological findings identified a clear cell carcinoma. We diagnosed metastasis from the RCC. We performed a jejunectomy to resect the tumor and thus eliminate the source of the bleeding.Conclusions:CE and DBE are useful diagnostic tools. We recommend investigating the possibility of small intestinal metastases in cases of intestinal bleeding or anemia in patients with a history of malignant tumor.
