Objective:To explore the effects of toosendanin in inducing apoptosis of human hepatocarcinoma cell line SMMC-7721 and Hep3B, and its influence on the related genes, Bcl-2, Bax and Fas.Methods:The inhibitory rate of cell proliferation and cell growth curve were detected by MTT assay; morphological changes of cells were observed by inverted microscope; early stage apoptosis rate were detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI assay; relative activities of Caspase-3,-8 and-9 were analyzed by spectrophotometry; and the expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and Fas were detected using immunohistochemistry assay.Results:Toosendanin presented significant inhibitory effect on proliferation of hepatocarcinoma cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After toosendanin treatment, the amount of cells was significantly reduced, shrunk in size and rounded in shape, with decreased adhesion ability. The apoptosis rates of SMMC-7721 cells and Hep3B cells treated with 0.5 micromol/L toosendanin for 72 h were 21.55% and 18.35% respectively, which were reduced after z-VAD-fmk (inhibitor of Caspase) treatment. The activities of Caspase-3,-8 and -9 all markedly enhanced after treatment in SMMC-7721 cells, while in Hep3B cells, activities of Caspase-3 and -9 enhanced, but that of Caspase-8 unchanged. As compared with the control group, after toosendanin treatment, expression of Bcl-2 decreased, and that of Bax and Fas increased in SMMC-7721 cells; but in Hep3B cells the expression of Bcl-2 decreased, that of Bax increased, and expression of Fas unchanged.Conclusions:Toosendanin could inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of both P53 and P53 human hepatocarcinoma cells, which involved the participation of mitochondria-dependent pathway. So it may be a kind of natural anti-cancer drug, playing its effect through P53 independent pathway.
