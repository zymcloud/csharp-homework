Background:Little is known about the possible association between nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and allograft survival and overall patient survival.Objective:To determine the association between posttransplant NMSC and early to mid-term allograft survival and overall patient survival after kidney, liver, or heart transplantation.Methods and materials:We retrospectively reviewed patients identified from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database. The study included adult recipients of kidney (n=46,216), liver (n=8,049), and heart (n=8,519) transplants from 1996 to 2001.Results:Multivariate analysis showed that kidney recipients with NMSC had a significantly lower risk of allograft loss (relative risk (RR)=0.55, p<.001) and death (RR=0.55; p<.001) within 5 years of transplantation than recipients without NMSC. Significantly lower risk of death was also observed for liver recipients (RR=0.28, p<.001) and heart recipients (RR=0.25; p<.001) with NMSC.Conclusions:Longer early to mid-term allograft and overall survival was seen in patients with NMSC, but long-term survival rates must be examined to determine whether mortality rates increase later for patients with NMSC, as noted in previous studies.
