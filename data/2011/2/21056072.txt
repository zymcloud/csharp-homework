Urotensin II (UII) is a somatostatin-like peptide involved in cell proliferation and in tumor biology. To explore the role of liver-derived UII in the pathogenesis of precancerous liver lesions in rat, we investigated the expression of UII and its receptor, UT, in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced precancerous liver lesions and the effects of UII on cell proliferation by hepatic oval cells. Radioimmunoassay, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot were used in this study. Compared with untreated controls, rats treated with DEN showed increased UII content by 47.7% in plasma and by 164.9% in liver tissue (all P
