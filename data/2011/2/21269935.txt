Background:Decreased cardiac contractility has been observed in cirrhosis, suggesting a latent cardiomyopathy in these patients. This study was designed to evaluate left ventricular structure and function in patients with end-stage liver disease by the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scoring system.Methods:We recruited 82 patients (72 male, 10 female; mean age 50.3+/-8.9 years) with end-stage liver disease who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation between January 2002 and May 2008. Seventy-eight patients had cirrhosis and 4 had primary liver cancer. Patients were categorized into three groups on the basis of MELD score: ≤ 9 (27 patients, 33%); 10-19 (40, 49%); and ≥ 20 (15, 18%). The relationship between MELD score and cardiac structure and function was determined. Preoperative assessments of blood biochemistry, blood coagulation, serum virology, echocardiography and electrocardiography were performed.Results:MELD score was positively correlated with enlarged left atrial diameter, increased interventricular septum thickness (IVST), increased aortic flow, corrected QT interval (QTc) extension and cardiac output (P=0.033, 0.002, 0.000, 0.000 and 0.009, respectively). International normalized ratio also had a correlation with the above parameters and enlarged left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (P=0.043, 0.010, 0.000, 0.001, 0.016 and 0.008, respectively). Serum creatinine was positively correlated with IVST (r=0.257, P=0.020), but negatively correlated with early maximal ventricular filling velocity/late diastolic or atrial velocity ratio (r=-0.300, P=0.006). A difference of QTc >440 ms among the three groups was statistically significant (X2=9.791, P=0.007).Conclusions:Abnormalities in cardiac structure and function are common in patients with end-stage liver disease. MELD score is a practically useful approach for the assessment of cardiac function in such patients.
