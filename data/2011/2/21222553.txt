Introduction:DC Bead is an embolic drug-eluting bead designed to be loaded with chemotherapeutic agents (such as doxorubicin and irinotecan), delivered intra-arterially into tumor blood vessels to block nutrient flow and then to deliver the drug locally in a sustained fashion. This product is finding increasing use in the treatment of patients with both primary and secondary liver cancers.Areas covered:This review positions DC Bead in the field of targeted embolic drug delivery and with respect to other competitive technologies in the treatment of liver cancer. An overview of the studies that demonstrate the product's performance, safety and efficacy is presented. The clinical application of the doxorubicin loaded DC Bead is firstly reviewed, in the context of treatment of patients with various stages of hepatocellular carcinoma. Its combination with other therapies is also discussed, together with consideration of the treatment of other liver tumors. Secondly, the use of irinotecan loaded DC Bead, primarily for the treatment of colorectal cancer metastases to the liver, but also some additional rare metastases, is summarized.Expert opinion:An opinion is proffered as to how this technology and its application is evolving, illustrating a move towards synergistic combination therapies and into other cancer indications.
