Comamonas testosteroni is a widely distributed aerobic gram-negative bacillus. Infection by C testosteroni is infrequent, and no such cases have been reported in Taiwan. Here, we would like to present a 54-year-old alcoholic patient from Taiwan, and his left leg was injured during a fishing trip, resulting in left leg cellulitis and C testosteroni bacteremia. The patient's fever subsided after initial treatment with extended-spectrum cephalosporin, whereas his erythematous swelling did not resolve until switched to ciprofloxacin. The second patient is a 73-year-old Taiwanese male with chronic hepatitis B infection, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Comamonas testosteroni bacteremia was found after transarterial embolization. Further studies are necessary to determine the best antibiotic(s) for patients infected with C testosteroni.
