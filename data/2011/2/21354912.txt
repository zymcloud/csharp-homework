Objective:To investigate UbcH10 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and explore its clinicopathological implications.Methods:We detected UbcH10 mRNA expression using RT-PCR in normal liver cell line, cancer cell lines, surgically removed hepatocellular carcinoma tissue and corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissue and evaluated the clinicopathological significance of UbcH10. Immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate UbcH10 protein expression in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, the adjacent tissue, and normal liver tissue specimens.Results:Normal liver cell line L02 showed significantly lower UbcH10 mRNA expression levels than the cancer cell lines BEL-7402, Hep3B, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 (PConclusion:UbcH10 is over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and may serve as a novel biomarker as well as a therapeutic target of hepatocellular carcinoma.
