We evaluated the efficacy of a combination strategy, Endostar, a modified recombinant human endostatin, plus dexamethasone, against angiogenesis and hepatoma growth. By colony formation assay, synergistic effects of the combination of Endostar and dexamethasone were observed on the proliferations of human umbilical endothelial cells and hepatoma Bel-7402 cells. Endostar plus dexamethasone inhibited angiogenesis events in vitro. Examined with transwell assay, HUVECs invasion was more efficiently suppressed by combination of Endostar and dexamethasone than by the respective single drug. But the combination treatment of Endostar and dexamethasone to Bel-7402 cells did not alter the migration of HUVECs. The migration of HUVEC tended to coincident with VEGF secretion as determined by ELISA. Tube formation assay, rat aortic ring assay and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay indicated that the anti-angiogenesis effects of Endostar were significantly enhanced by dexamethasone. In mouse hepatoma H22 and human hepatoma Bel-7402 subcutaneous xenograft, Endostar plus dexamethasone presented more potent efficacy in tumor growth suppression than the single drug treatments. The above confirms the synergism of Endostar and dexamethasone on anti-angiogenesis and suppression of hepatoma growth. The potentiation effects of the combination indicate that Endostar plus dexamethasone might be a positive strategy for cancer therapy.
