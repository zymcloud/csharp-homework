Purpose:Studies have established the value of [(methyl)1-(11)C]-acetate ([(11)C]Act) combined with 2-deoxy-2[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using positron emission tomography (PET). In this study, the metabolic fate of [(11)C]Act in HCC was characterized.Methods:Experiments with acetic acid [1-(14)C] sodium salt ([(14)C]Act) were carried out on WCH-17 cells and freshly derived rat hepatocytes. PET scans with [(11)C]Act were also carried out on woodchucks with HCC before injection of [(14)C]Act. The radioactivity levels in different metabolites were quantified with thin-layer chromatography.Results:In WCH-17 cells, the predominant metabolite was phosphatidylcholine (PC). Regions of HCCs with the highest [(11)C]Act uptake had higher radioactivity accumulation in lipid-soluble compounds than surrounding hepatic tissues. In those regions, PC and triacylglycerol (TG) accumulated more radioactivity than in surrounding hepatic tissues.Conclusions:High [(11)C]Act uptake in HCC is associated with increased de novo lipogenesis. PC and TG are the main metabolites into which the radioactive label from [(11)C]Act is incorporated in HCC.
