Background:Sorafenib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor licensed for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Thyroid function test abnormalities have been reported for different tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but only limited data on thyroid function test abnormalities related to sorafenib are available, demonstrating the occurrence of hypothyroidism in patients treated with sorafenib.Summary:We describe two patients who developed temporary hyperthyroidism during the course of sorafenib treatment, which was followed by overt and subclinical hypothyroidism, respectively. Thyroid ultrasonography showed an atrophic thyroid gland in patient 1 , and signs of thyroiditis in patient 2 . Detailed reassessment of thyroid volumes on routinely performed computerized tomography scans showed a gradual decrease in thyroid volume during sorafenib treatment in one patient, suggesting progressive thyroid destruction.Conclusion:This case report describes in detail and for the first time two cases of sorafenib-induced thyroiditis. We assume that this sorafenib-induced destructive thyroiditis is an important cause of sorafenib-induced hypothyroidism.
