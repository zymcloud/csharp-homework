An 83-year-old man was admitted with renal dysfunction, anemia, and peripheral leukocytosis. His peripheral leukocyte count was 41000/Âµl. A computed tomography scan revealed a solid cystic mass in the liver, mural thickening in the ascending colon and nodules in the right lower lung field. Colonoscopy revealed ascending colon cancer, and analysis of the biopsy specimens revealed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. However, although a liver abscess was suspected, pus and bacteria were not found in the cystic lesion of the liver mass, the solid lesion of the mass was diagnosed as carcinoma. The serum concentration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was elevated to 256 pg/ml. Because his general condition worsened, we could not treat these tumors, but he died 38 days after admission. Autopsy revealed adenosquamous carcinoma of the liver, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon, urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder, and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining for G-CSF in the liver tumor sample.
