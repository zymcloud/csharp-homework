New perspectives for radiosensitization in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have emerged with the increasing knowledge of mechanisms involved in liver oncogenesis. As a matter of fact, some of these mechanisms have also a role in the response to ionizing radiation. We review some of the major molecular pathways involved in the oncogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These include cellular proliferation pathways, repair systems, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. However, there are few preclinical data on concurrent targeted therapies and ionizing radiation in hepatocellular carcinoma models. Preliminary studies are ongoing. Their results might help to better define the potential benefit of such radiosensitizing strategies in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma.
