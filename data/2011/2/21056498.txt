Background & aims:Knowledge of pre-operative tumour grade is crucial in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because it can influence recurrence and survival after surgery. The accuracy of pre-operative needle core biopsy (NCB) in tumour grading has been assessed in only a few studies with conflicting results. Our aim was to determine the long-term safety and the overall accuracy of NCB in assessing tumour grading in subjects who had undergone liver resection for a single HCC.Methods:Eighty-one cirrhotic patients with HCC who had undergone NCB before liver resection were selected. Only patients with a single HCC and with at least a five-year-follow-up were included. Tumour grading was scored according to a modified Edmondson-Steiner classification: well/moderately (low grade) vs poorly-differentiated (high grade).Results:In the 81 patients with a solitary HCC (mean size 4.1 Â± 2.3cm) tumour grade was correctly identified by NCB in 74 out of 81 (91.4%) HCCs. NCB overall sensitivity and specificity were 65% and 98.1%, respectively, with a PPV of 92% and an NPV of 91%. No major complications (in particular tumour seeding) were observed. The overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 83%, 62%, and 44%, respectively; the recurrence rate after a 5-year-follow-up was 56.2% for low grade and 82.3% for high grade tumours (pConclusions:Pre-operative NCB can be performed on early (
