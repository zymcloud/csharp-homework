Aim:To study the expression and clinical significance of vaseular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tissue of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) and effects on tumor invasion and metastasis.Methods:The VEGF expression from 60 cases of PHC tissues, 30 cases of adjacent tissues and 30 cases of normal tissue were detected by SP immunohistochemical method.Results:The VEGF positive rate of the PHC group was 68.3%, the adjacent tissues group was 40.0%, and the normal tissue group was 33.3%, compared the different was significant (PConclusion:The VEGF has high expression in PHC tissues. The VEGF expression has close relation with the whether tumor capsule and distant metastasis. The VEGF plays an important role angiogenesis of PHC, growth and metastasis.
