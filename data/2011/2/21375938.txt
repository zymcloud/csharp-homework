Objective:To evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:According to the Cochrane handbook for systematic review, two reviewers independently completed the whole process of literature search, study selection, data collection, and quality assessment. Seven electric databases(PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Chinese Journal Full-text Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Scientific and Technical Journal Database, Chinese Medical Association Digital Periodicals Database) were searched and randomized controlled trials (RCT) of sorafenib in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma were collected and analyzed.Results:Two RCT involving 828 patients were finally included. Compared with placebo, sorafenib significantly extended the overall survival and time to radiologic progression and improved the disease control rate. The main adverse effects were systemic, gastrointestinal, and dermatologic symptoms (grade 1 or 2 in severity), although the incidences were significantly higher in sorafenib groups than in control groups.Conclusion:Sorafenib is effective and safe for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
