Background & aims:The abnormalities associated with cancer cachexia include anorexia, weight loss, muscle loss and atrophy, anaemia and alterations in carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism. The aim of the present investigation was to examine the anti-wasting effects of some nutraceuticals such as genistein, resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate and diallyl sulphide (DAS).Methods:The in vitro effects of these nutraceuticals on proteolysis were examined in muscle cell cultures submitted to hyperthermia. The in vivo effects of DAS were also tested in cachectic tumour-bearing rats (Yoshida AH-130 ascites hepatoma).Results:Although all the nutraceuticals tested inhibited muscle proteolysis, the most promising effects were related with DAS. In vivo administration of DAS only leads to a small improvement in tibialis muscle and heart weights; however, administration of DAS to healthy animals increased all muscle weights, this being associated with a decreased gene expression of proteolytic systems components.Conclusion:It may be suggested that DAS could be used to improve muscle mass during healthy conditions.
