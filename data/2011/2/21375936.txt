Objective:To explore the sensitivity and specificity of Golgi protein 73 (GP73) monoclonal antibody in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Self-prepared GP73 monoclonal antibody was used as the primary antibody for detecting the serum GP73 levels in healthy controls(n=31)and HCC patients (n=59). The baseline level of the healthy controls was determined by semiquantitative analysis. The results were compared with those from GP73 polyclonal antibody and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).Results:The GP73 level of healthy controls was 1.2 (0.9-1.7) relative unit (RU), which was significantly lower than that of HCC patients [5.7 (2.5-7.8) RU] (PConclusions:Our self-prepared monoclonal antibody can effectively detect GP73 serum level in HCC patients, and has higher sensitivity and specificity than AFP. It may be superior to the currently used GP73 polyclonal antibody. The results lay the foundation for the further development of ELISA methods by using this monoclonal antibody.
