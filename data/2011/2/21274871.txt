Acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) plays important roles in the cholinergic system, and its dysregulation is involved in a variety of human diseases. However, the roles and implications of ACHE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that ACHE was significantly down-regulated in the cancerous tissues of 69.2% of HCC patients, and the low ACHE expression in HCC was correlated with tumor aggressiveness, an elevated risk of postoperative recurrence, and a low survival rate. Both the recombinant ACHE protein and the enhanced expression of ACHE significantly inhibited HCC cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Further study showed that ACHE suppressed cell proliferation via its enzymatic activity of acetylcholine catalysis and degradation. Moreover, ACHE could inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidyl inositol-3'-phosphate kinase/protein kinase B pathways in HCC cells and thereby increase the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β and lead to β-catenin degradation and cyclin D1 suppression. In addition, increased ACHE expression could remarkably sensitize HCC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (i.e., adriamycin and etoposide).Conclusion:For the first time, we describe the function of ACHE as a tumor growth suppressor in regulating cell proliferation, the relevant signaling pathways, and the drug sensitivity of HCC cells. ACHE is a promising independent prognostic predictor for HCC recurrence and the survival of HCC patients. These findings provide new insights into potential strategies for drug discovery and improved HCC treatment.
