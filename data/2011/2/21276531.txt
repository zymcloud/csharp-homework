Background:A laparoscopic approach has not been advocated for repeat hepatectomy on a large scale. This report analyzes the experience of 3 institutions pioneering laparoscopic repeat liver resection (LRLR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, oncologic integrity, and outcomes of LRLR.Study design:All patients undergoing LRLR were identified. Since 1997, 76 LRLRs have been attempted. Operative indications were metastasis (n = 63), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 3), and benign tumors (n = 10). All patients had 1 or more earlier liver resections (28 open, 44 laparoscopic), including 16 major resections (en bloc removal of 3 or more Couinaud segments).Results:Eight conversions (11%) to open resections (n = 7) or radiofrequency ablation (n = 1) were required due to technical difficulties or hemorrhage. LRLRs included 49 wedge or segmental resections and 19 major hepatectomies. Median blood loss and operative time were 300 mL and 180 minutes. Patients with previous open liver resection (group B) experienced more intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements than those with earlier laparoscopic resections (group A) (p = 0.02; p = 0.01, respectively). R0 resection was achieved in 58 of 64 (91%) patients with malignant tumor. The incidence of postoperative complications and duration of hospital stay were not statistically different between the 2 groups. Bile leakages developed in 5 (6.6%) patients, including 1 requiring reoperation. There was no perioperative death. Median tumor size was 25 mm (range 5 to 125 mm) and the median number of tumors was 2 (range 1 to 7). Median follow-up was 23.5 months (range 0 to 86 months). There was no port-site metastasis. The 3- and 5-year actuarial survivals for patients with colorectal metastases were 83% and 55%, respectively.Conclusions:Laparoscopic repeat hepatic resections can be performed safely and with good results, particularly in patients with earlier laparoscopic resections.
