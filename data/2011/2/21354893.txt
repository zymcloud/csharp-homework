Objective:To synthesize a tumor-targeting cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) and evaluate its biological activity and cytotoxicity in vitro.Methods:With fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) as the protective group of Î±-amino acid, the tumor-targeting CPP were synthesized with stepwise amino acid extension using solid-phase synthesis method. 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine was added for fluorescence labeling in the presence of the coupling agents HATU and DMF. The purity of the CPP was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and its molecular weight measured by mass spectrometry. Fluorescence microscope was used to assess the cell-penetrating activity?of the CPP in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines SMMC-7721 and normal hepatocellular cell lines LO2. The growth activity of CPP-treated SMMC-7721 cells was measured by MTT assay.Results:With a purity of 96.05% and a relative molecular mass of 3504.9, the synthesized CPP showed no translocation activity in normal hepatocellular cell lines LO2, but showed strong ability to translocate into SMMC-7721 cells without affecting the biological activity of the cells.Conclusion:Using Fmoc solid-phase synthesis method, we have successfully synthesized the CPP with tumor-targeting activity.
