Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is widely used in clinical practice as an antiseptic and flushing agent after surgery to remove a tumor. Our present study was designed to determine whether diluted PVP-I is cytotoxic to colon cancer cells and ascetic tumor cells in vitro and to examine its antitumor effects in vivo. In vitro, CT26 and H22 cells treated with different concentrations of diluted PVP-I (0-1.56 µg/ml) were analyzed using the mononuclear cell direct cytotoxicity assay (MTT) and a flow cytometry assay. In vivo, Balb/c mice injected in the abdominal cavity with CT26 cells or H22 cells were treated intraperitoneally with different concentrations of PVP-I (0-312.5 µg/mouse), cisplatin (40 mg/kg) or 5'-FU (30 mg/kg) or left untreated. In vitro, the studies demonstrated the antiproliferative and significant apoptosis-inducing effects of PVP-I in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In vivo, PVP-I significantly repressed the growth of H22 and CT26 cells in Balb/c mice compared to controls. To explore the mechanism of the antitumor effect of PVP-I, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of ascites extracted from a mouse model and the supernatant of CT26 cells was detected by an SOD kit. The activity of SOD was significantly inhibited in the experimental groups. Taken together, our data suggest that PVP-I exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on tumor growth in colon cancer (CT26) and hepatoma (H22) resulting from apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a new potential therapeutic approach after tumor excision surgery to colon cancer and hepatoma.
