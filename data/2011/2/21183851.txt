Objective:To evaluate the evolution of liver transplantation (LT) in cases with partial and total portal vein thrombosis (PVT).Background:Portal vein thrombosis and in particular total PVT are still surgically demanding conditions, which can exclude patients from LT or increase the postoperative complications after LT.Methods:We reviewed our 10-year experience (first era 1998–2002 and second era 2003–2008), comparing the outcome of patients with PVT to a group without PVT.Results:Among 889 LTs, we intraoperatively diagnosed 91 PVTs (10.2%):51 partial PVTs (56%) and 40 total PVTs (44%). The rate of complete PVTs increased from the first to the second era (2.2% vs. 6.7%, P Conclusions:Liver transplantation offers good survival in patients with partial PVT but also in selected cases with total PVT, where surgical innovation has improved the results.
