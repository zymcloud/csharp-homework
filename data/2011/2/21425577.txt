Objective:To observe comparatively the effects of Bushen Jianpi Decoction (BJD) and its disassemble recipes on tumor growth in mice with transplanted primary hepatic carcinoma (PCH).Methods:Fifty mice with transplanted PCH were randomly and equally divided into 5 groups. The blank control group consisted of untreated model mice, and 4 treated groups consisted of model mice treated with 5-FU (q. o. d, intraperitoneal injection, x 5), BJD and it disassemble recipes (Bushen portion and Jianpi portion, abbreviated as BSP and JPP hereafter) q. d. by gastrogavage for 10 successive days. The body mass, tumor size, serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level, tumor cell apoptosis and percentage of cells, cell cycle as well as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were observed.Results:Among the 4 treated groups, the heaviest body mass and the de-tumor body mass of mice, and the lowest tumor index were presented in the BJD treated group (P Conclusions:The acting mechanism of BJD and its disassembled recipes on transplanted PCH may be inhibiting VEGF expression and accelerating tumor cell apoptosis. Change of MRI's ADC value was keeping in step with changing of VEGF and cell apoptosis. Thereby, it could objectively reflect the metabolism of tumor cells, being a new means for assessing the effect of Chinese materia medica.
