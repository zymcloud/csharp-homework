Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the important health problems worldwide, especially in China. Feasible and effective animal models of HBV infection in vivo are prerequisite for the HBV-related basic and clinical studies. Located in the highly prevalent region of HBV and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the laboratory of Guangxi Cancer Institute has focused on the cause, pathogenesis and chemoprevention of HCC, and has started the work of establishing tree shrew (Tupaia) models of HBV infection in vivo since the early 1980s. This paper provides an overview of the research process, and highlights the new progress on the chronic infection of tree shrews after inoculated with HBV neonatally in vivo.
