Selective replication in tumor cells is a highly desirable feature for oncolytic viruses. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in controlling gene expression, and that certain tissue-specific miRNAs are frequently downregulated in malignant cells. miR-122 is a liver-specific microRNA. It is abundantly expressed in normal hepatocytes but is absent in many hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. We hypothesized that expression of an essential viral gene by a liver-specific promoter would initially restrict virus replication to cells of hepatic origin and that adding miR-122 complementary sequences to the viral gene would make the transcripts degradable by miR-122 in normal hepatocytes, thus further confining its replication to HCC. We have constructed such an oncolytic herpes simplex virus by linking the essential viral glycoprotein H gene with the liver-specific apolipoprotein E (apoE)-AAT promoter and by adding the miR-122a complimentary sequence to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). To further increase the safety of this virus, complementary sequences from miR-124a and let-7 were also engineered into the same 3'UTR. Designated liver-cancer specific oncolytic virus (LCSOV), it was highly selective in killing HCC cells and in shrinking HCC xenografts. We conclude that LCSOV is a highly specific oncolytic virus that can precisely target HCC.
