Protein tyrosine phophatases (PTPs) are implicated in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of human cancer. The phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) gene family, a subgroup of PTPs is also linked to these processes. In many solid cancers, high levels of PRL-3 expression are related with metastasis and poor prognosis. However, the expression patterns of PRL-1 and -2 have not been explored in lung cancer yet. Thus, we investigated the expression levels of PRL-1, -2 and -3 in the tissues of primary lung cancer patients. The protein expression levels of PRL-2, but not PRL-1 and -3 were increased in cancer tissues. However, there was no correlation between mRNA and protein expression levels of the PRLs. Reporter assays showed that PRLs suppressed the activity of the p21 promoter but promoted AP-1 activity. Furthermore, transfection of PRLs showed significantly increased cell proliferation. Therefore, these results suggest that PRL-2 plays an important role in lung cancer and can be a biomarker of lung cancer, substituting for the function of other PRLs.
