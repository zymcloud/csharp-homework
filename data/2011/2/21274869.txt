Liver transplantation (LT) has become an accepted therapy for end-stage liver disease in human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) patients, but the specific results of LT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unknown. Between 2003 and 2008, 21 HIV+ patients and 65 HIV- patients with HCC were listed for LT at a single institution. Patient characteristics and pathological features were analyzed. Univariate analysis for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after LT was applied to identify the impact of HIV infection. HIV+ patients were younger than HIV- patients [median age: 48 (range = 41-63 years) versus 57 years (range = 37-72 years), P Conclusion:Because of a higher dropout rate among HIV+ patients, HIV infection impaired the results of LT for HCC on an intent-to-treat basis but had no significant impact on OS and RFS after LT.
