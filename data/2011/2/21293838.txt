The importance of partial liver resection as a therapeutic option to cure hepatic tumors has increased over the last decades. This has been influenced on the one hand by advances in surgical and anesthetic management resulting in a reduced mortality after surgery and on the other hand by an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Nowadays, partial resection of the liver is performed safely and as a routine operation in specialized centers. This article describes the pathophysiological changes secondary to liver failure and assesses the perioperative management of patients undergoing partial or extended liver resection. It looks in detail at the preoperative assessment, the intraoperative anesthetic management including fluid management and techniques to reduce blood loss as well as postoperative analgesia and intensive care therapy.
