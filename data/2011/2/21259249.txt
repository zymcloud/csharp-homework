Background and objectives:To improve diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS), we investigated the usefulness of new contrast medium of microbubble agent, Sonazoid as a preliminary study.Method:We examined IOUS in 50 patients with liver tumors who underwent hepatectomy. Sonazoid was administrated intravenously and Kupffer-phase images of the tumor were observed before hepatectomy. Sonazoid was reinjected to observe the tumor vasculature.Results:The tumors included hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 25 patients, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in 3, colorectal liver metastasis in 14, gastrointestinal stromal tumor in 1, and benign hematoma in 1. Liver tumors were clearly detected as perfusion defect in most cases. Small lesions (Conclusion:Sonazoid-IOUS is a promising useful tool to detect the precise tumor margin and small tumors, hence allowing curative hepatectomy or intraoperative ablation.
