The aim of our study was to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the previously unrecognized role of cytoplasmic alpha fetoprotein (AFP) in retinoic acid receptors (RAR) mediated expression and biological effects of GADD153. Using microarray analysis, the expression of the GADD153 gene showed the greatest fold change among apoptosis/growth related genes in response to ATRA. AFP was able to interact with RAR in HepG2 cells, which was undetectable in HLE cells owing to absence of AFP. ATRA promoted nuclei entrance of RAR, expression of GADD153 and apoptosis, and these changes were reversed after transfection with the afp gene or addition of AGN193109. The level of GADD153 was gradually elevated as the effect of AFP was counteracted by increasing dose or prolonging treatment time with ATRA in HepG2 cells. Knockdown of AFP in siRNA-transfected HepG2 cells or over-expression of AFP in afp gene-transfected HLE cells was synchronously associated with up-regulation or down-regulation, respectively, of GADD153 expression. Both ATRA administration and AFP knockdown were each able to promote greater binding of RAR to its response element with consequent elevation of the proportion of apoptotic cells. Conversely, transfection of HLE cells with pcDNA3.1-afp resulted in apparent reduction of RAR binding to DNA and change of biological effect. These data taken together demonstrate the involvement of AFP in RAR-mediated expression and biological effects of GADD153. These findings provide a novel insight into the mechanism underlying the impact of AFP on the RAR signal network.
