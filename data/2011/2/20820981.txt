Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of inflammation-related cancer that usually follows chronic inflammations. Leukotriene D4 (LTD4) is a potent biologically active arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediator that is intimately involved in inflammations and cancers. Although previous researches found overexpression of LTD4 in several other cancers, the circulating LTD4 level in HCC remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine concentrations of LTD4 and analyze its roles in HCC. The results showed that remarkably high circulating LTD4 in HCC versus healthy subjects (p
