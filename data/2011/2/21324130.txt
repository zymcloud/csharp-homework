Background:The effect of antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) on reducing the risk of long-term complications (LTCs) remains unclear so far. To study whether long-term nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy can reduce the risk of long-term complications.Methods:We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, OVID, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Relative risks (RRs) of long-term complications with or without treatment were studied. Also subgroup analyses including the status of drug-resistance, HBeAg and pre-existing compensated cirrhosis were done using relative risks of long-term complications either with or without treatment or among nucleos(t)ide analogues treatment groups.Results:Six eligible studies (3644 patients in all) were included. Data showed the incidence of long-term complications in treatment groups was induced by 74%(RR:0.26, 95% CI: 0.15-0.47) compared with no treatment. Whether drug-resistant happened or not during the long-term therapy, the incidence of long-term complications was still significantly induced respectively by 45%(RR: 0.55,95%CI:0.40-0.76) and 78% (RR:0.22, 95%CI: 0.13-0.36). For both different status of HBeAg and pre-existing compensated cirrhosis, there was significant lower incidence of long-term complications in treatment groups compared with no treatment, too. Moreover, among the NA treatment groups, patients with drug-resistance had 2.64 times (RR:2.64, 95%CI: 1.58-4.41) higher chance of developing to long-term complications, and patients with pre-existing compensated cirrhosis also had 3.07 times (RR:3.07, 95%CI: 1.04-9.11) higher chance of developing to long-term complications.Conclusions:Long-term nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy for adults with CHB prevents or delays the development of long-term complications including decompensated cirrhosis, CHB-related death or CHB-related HCC in patients with CHB. The patients who need take antiviral drugs should receive the antiviral therapy as soon as possible.
