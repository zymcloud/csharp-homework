Sorafenib (NexavarÂ®, BAY 43-9006) is a novel, orally administered multi-kinase inhibitor that has recently been approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. It is also used to delay disease progression in patients with advanced solid organ malignancies and metastatic melanoma. Sorafenib is associated with a relatively high incidence of dermatologic adverse events. The commonly occurring dermatologic adverse events associated with sorafenib include hand-foot skin reaction, facial erythema, splinter subungual hemorrhages, alopecia, pruritus and xerosis. We report here on a case of a 50-year-old man who was diagnosed with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. He developed both facial erythema and hand-foot skin reaction after the administration of sorafenib.
