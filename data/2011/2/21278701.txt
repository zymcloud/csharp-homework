Background:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japan has still been increasing. The aim of the present study was to analyze the epidemiological trend of HCC in the western area of Japan, Kyushu.Material/methods:A total of 10,010 patients with HCC diagnosed between 1996 and 2008 in the Liver Cancer study group of Kyushu (LCSK), were recruited for this study. Cohorts of patients with HCC were categorized into five year intervals. The etiology of HCC was categorized to four groups as follows; B: HBsAg positive, HCV-RNA negative, C: HCV-RNA positive, HBsAg negative, B+C: both of HBsAg and HCV-RNA positive, nonBC: both of HBsAg and HCV-RNA negative.Results:B was 14.8% (1,485 of 10,010), whereas 68.1% (6,819 of 10,010) had C, and 1.4% (140 of 10,010) had HCC associated with both viruses. The remaining 1,566 patients (15.6%) did not associate with both viruses. Cohorts of patients with HCC were divided into six-year intervals (1996-2001 and 2002-2007). The ratio of C cases decreased from 73.1% in 1996-2001 to 64.9% in 2002-2007. On the other hand, B and -nonBC cases increased significantly from 13.9% and 11.3% in 1996-2001 to 16.2% and 17.6% in 2002-2007, respectively.Conclusions:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis C infection decreased after 2001 in Kyushu area. This change was due to the increase in the number and proportion of the HCC not only nonBC patients but also B patients.
