Background & aims:Genetic dimorphisms modulate the activities of several pro- or antioxidant enzymes, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), catalase (CAT), manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1). We assessed the role of the G(-463)A-MPO, T(-262)C-CAT, Ala16Val-SOD2, and Pro198Leu-GPx1 variants in modulating HCC development in patients with HCV-induced cirrhosis.Methods:Two hundred and five patients with HCV-induced, biopsy-proven cirrhosis but without detectable HCC at inclusion were prospectively followed-up for HCC development. The influence of various genotypes on HCC occurrence was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:During follow-up (103.2Â±3.4 months), 84 patients (41%) developed HCC, and 66 died. Whereas the Ala16Val-SOD2 or Pro198Leu-GPx1 dimorphisms did not modulate the risk, HCC occurrence was increased in patients with either the homozygous GG-MPO genotype (HR=2.8 [1.7-4.4]; first quartile time to HCC occurrence: 45 vs. 96 months; LogRank Conclusions:The high activity-associated GG-MPO genotype increases the rate of HCC occurrence in patients with HCV-induced cirrhosis.
