Several radiological techniques have been used for treating hepatocellular carcinoma. These include transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and percutaneous therapy, such as radiofrequency (RF). The treatment efficacy of radiofrequency for hepatocellular carcinoma has been confirmed by several randomized and non randomized studies, with a benefit in terms of morbidity comparatively to surgery when cirrhosis is present. Radiofrequency ablation treatment is based on tumour size, shape and location, with a defined strategy and a proper patient selection. We will also review indications and technical aspects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). It is an accepted worldwide and effective treatment for patients with unresectable large or multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma. It improves significantly survival for adequate selected patients with preservation of liver function.
