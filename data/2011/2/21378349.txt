Advanced esophageal cancer with widespread metastasis to lymph nodes or other organs is difficult to treat and has an extremely poor prognosis. A new combined chemotherapy of docetaxel with cisplatin (CDDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (DPF therapy) was performed and its efficacy and safety were examined. Among those hospitalized between May 2003 and October 2009, 30 patients with stage III or stage IV unresectable, untreated advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma which had invaded other organs were enrolled in this study. The regimen of DPF therapy was as follows: a set of intravenous drips of 60 mg/m(2) of docetaxel (day 1), 60 mg/m(2) of CDDP (day 1) and 800 mg/m(2) of 5-FU (days 1-5) was administered twice at an interval of 3 to 4 weeks. Antitumor effects, adverse reactions and treatment outcomes were then examined. The patients included 26 men and 4 women aged 40 to 73 years (average age, 58.1 years), and the performance status (PS) was 1 in 18 cases and 2 in 12 cases. The main location of the esophageal cancer was the upper/middle/lower thoracic esophagus in 7/14/9 cases, respectively. Clinical stage was III in 5 cases and IV in 25. The effective rate of DPF therapy was 83.3% for the primary lesion (complete response, CR: 4 cases, partial response, PR: 21 cases), 72.4% for lymph node metastasis (CR: 3 cases, PR: 18 cases) and 72.0% for distant organ metastasis (CR: 3 cases, PR: 15 cases). The observed adverse reactions of grade 2 or higher of National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) included anemia (16.7%), leukopenia (73.3%), liver dysfunction (20.0%), anorexia (16.7%), stomatitis (33.3%), esophagitis (16.7%), alopecia (16.7%) and diarrhea (26.7%). The therapy completion rate was 96.7% and the therapy-related death rate was 3.3%. Treatments given after the completion of the DPF therapy were surgery in 6 cases, chemotherapy such as additional DPF in 12, chemoradiation in 4, esophageal stent placement in 1, and no treatment in 7. The patients' median survival time was 271 days, the 1-year survival rate was 41.9% and the 5-year survival rate was 13.3%. DPF therapy can be used as a standard chemotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer in view of its strong antitumor effect and relatively safe outcome.
