Objective:To establish standard serum proteomic pattern for early liver cancer and explore its value in early liver cancer diagnosis.Methods:The serum samples were obtained from 12 healthy subjects and 12 patients with early liver cancer. After removal of serum albumin and IgG, 300 Âµg serum sample was mixed with the hydrating solution for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Each experiment was repeated for 3 times. With silver staining and image analysis, the differentially expressed proteins were identified to establish the standard proteomic pattern for early liver cancer. The proteomics pattern was then tested in the diagnosis of 13 cases of chronic liver disease and 10 healthy individuals in a double-blind manner.Results:Thirty-eight differentially expressed protein spots were identified. Eleven protein spots with differential expressions by over 5 folds were analyzed to establish the standard proteomics pattern for early liver cancer, which showed a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 90% in early diagnosis of liver cancer.Conclusion:The standard serum 2-DE proteomic pattern for early liver cancer shows distinct differences from that of healthy subjects. The differentially expressed proteins and their specific combination pattern may have the potential for diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of early liver cancer.
