Objectives:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) has been widely used for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Super-selective TACE is preferable to non-selective therapy, because it maximises the impact of treatment on the tumour while minimising damage to tumour-free liver parenchyma. It is therefore important to advance the catheter tip as close as possible in the feeding artery. There is now a new microcatheter with a 1.9-Fr tip with no taper, which can be inserted into a 2.7-Fr microcatheter. In this study we describe the new technique of using the two microcatheters called the triaxial microcatheter method.Methods:We evaluated 30 TACE procedures to investigate whether or not the catheter tip could be advanced closer to HCC with the triaxial microcatheter method than with previous TACE using a conventional microcatheter.Results:With conventional microcatheters, the level of embolisation was a lobar artery in 4 cases, segmental in 8 cases, subsegmental in 15 cases and sub-subsegmental in only 1 case. TACE could not be performed in two cases. When using the triaxial microcatheter method the level of embolisation was subsegmental in 8 cases, including 2 in which the level was the same as that with a conventional microcatheter, sub-subsegmental in 13 cases and more distal in 7 cases. In the two cases in which TACE could not be performed with the conventional microcatheter, it could be performed sufficiently using the new method. As a whole, in 28 of the 30 procedures (93%) we could successfully advance a catheter tip closer than with the previous TACE.Conclusion:The triaxial microcatheter method appears to be useful.
