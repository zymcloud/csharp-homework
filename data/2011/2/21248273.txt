Background:Large-scale epidemiologic data on stroke in HIV-infected persons are scarce, especially in an era of combination antiretroviral therapies, which have prolonged patient survival, but may boost stroke risk. We assessed trends in the proportion of HIV infection among patients with stroke in the United States.Methods:Data were obtained from all states within the United States that contributed to the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. All patients admitted to hospitals between 1997 and 2006 with a primary discharge diagnosis of stroke (identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure codes) were included. Time trends in the proportion of these patients with HIV diagnosis were computed, and independent predictors of comorbid HIV diagnosis evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.Results:Of all (ischemic and hemorrhagic) stroke hospitalizations, patients with comorbid HIV infection constituted 0.09% in 1997 vs 0.15% in 2006 (p < 0.0001). Actual numbers of overall US stroke hospitalizations lessened 7% (998,739 to 926,997), while actual numbers of stroke hospitalizations with coexisting HIV infection rose 60% (888 to 1,425). Patients with comorbid HIV infection comprised 0.08% of ischemic strokes in 1997 vs 0.18% in 2006 (p < 0.0001), but their proportion of hemorrhagic strokes did not significantly change. Factors independently associated with higher odds of comorbid HIV diagnosis were Medicaid insurance, urban hospital type, dementia, liver disease, renal disease, and cancer.Conclusion:Over the last decade in the United States, there has been a substantial and significant rise in patients hospitalized for stroke with coexisting HIV infection. This has important public health and socioeconomic consequences.
