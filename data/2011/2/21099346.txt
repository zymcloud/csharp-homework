Two separate clinical studies of advanced hepatocarcinoma patients recently reported that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (nexavar) could extend survival of the patients only by 2-3 months. We also previously demonstrated that 4'-(p-toluenesulfonylamido)-4-hydroxychalcone (TSAHC) blocks the multilayer growth and migration mediated by TM4SF5, which is highly expressed in approximately 80% of Korean hepatocarcinoma patients. Therefore, we wondered how TSAHC might be different from sorafenib to deal with hepatocarcinoma in terms of the therapeutic characteristics including specificity for TM4SF5. TM4SF5 is previously shown to mediate tumorigenesis through cytosolic p27Kip1-mediated inactivation of RhoA, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, multilayer growth, migration, invasion, and tumor angiogenesis. In this study, TSAHC and two derivatives showed similar antagonistic activities against TM4SF5-mediated signaling and multilayer growth in vitro and anti-tumorigenic activity even in early stages of TM4SF5-mediated tumor formation in nude mice. Meanwhile, sorafenib was only effective much later in tumorigenesis in vivo and affected in vitro proliferation in a TM4SF5-independent manner. Altogether, these observations suggest that TSAHC may be a promising anti-tumorigenic reagent, especially against TM4SF5-mediated hepatocarcinoma.
