Background:We aimed to evaluate therapeutic outcomes of radiofrequency (RF) ablation following intra-arterial iodized-oil injection for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) invisible on ultrasonographic (US) images.Materials and methods:Informed consent was waived for this retrospective study approved by our institutional review board. Sixty-seven consecutive patients with 150 HCCs (mean diameter 1.3 ± 0.6 cm; range 0.5-4.2 cm) received 90 RF sessions following intra-arterial iodized-oil injection. Each patient had at least one HCC invisible on US images. Computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopy-guided RF ablation was performed within 1 week after the injection of iodized oil from feeding arteries of each tumor. Technical success was defined as a planned electrode placement and completion of ablation protocol. Technical success, complications, changes in liver function, local tumor progression, and survival were evaluated.Results:All HCCs became visible on CT fluoroscopy after iodized-oil injection, and RF ablation was technically successful in all sessions (technical success rate, 100%, 90/90). Major complications occurred in 6 RF sessions (6.7%, 6/90), including hemorrhage (2.2%, 2/90), portal thrombosis (2.2%, 2/90), and pneumothorax (2.2%, 2/90). No significant deterioration in Child-Pugh score was found. The mean follow-up period was 23.2 ± 18.0 months. The cumulative local tumor progression rates and overall survival rates were, respectively, 3.9 and 82.7% at 1 year, 5.3 and 45.3% at 3 years, and 5.3 and 26.4% at 5 years.Conclusion:CT fluoroscopy-guided RF ablation following intra-arterial iodized-oil injection is a feasible, safe, and useful therapeutic option for HCCs invisible on US images.
