Purpose:To present a single center results, regarding radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of subcapsular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Forty patients with subcapsular HCC were treated with RFA under CT guidance for fifty-two discrete lesions in our institution. Twenty-eight patients underwent ablation of a solitary tumor and twelve patients underwent RFA of two tumors. Six patients had a subcapsular HCC with an exofitic location. All lesions had a diameter of Results:In forty-eight lesions complete tumor ablation was depicted at the one month CT scan. In four lesions with residual viable tumor, a second session was performed. After the second ablation no residual tumor was observed in any patient. No major complications occurred in any of our patients. Fever with a temperature up to 39 Â°C was documented during the first days as part of the post-ablation syndrome in thirteen patients (32.2%). Seeding along the needle track was observed in none of our patients. Local tumor progression, was observed in ten lesions (19.25%) and in all cases a second RFA session was performed with optimal results.Conclusion:Subcapsular location should not be considered as a contraindication for liver RFA.
