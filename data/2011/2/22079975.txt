The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/APO2L), a member of the TNF gene superfamily, induces apoptosis upon engagement of cognate death receptors. While TRAIL is relatively non-toxic to normal cells, it selectively induces apoptosis in many transformed cells. Nevertheless, some human hepatoma cells are particularly resistant to the effects of TRAIL. In this study, we show that J7, a novel methyl jasmonate analogue, sensitizes TRAIL-resistant HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Our results indicate that J7 substantially enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis, compared with treatment with either agent alone. Combined treatment with J7 and TRAIL effectively induced Bid cleavage, down-regulation of XIAP, cIAP-1 and Bcl-xL, activation of caspases, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and phopholipase Î³-1. In addition, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) showed a significant increase in cells following exposure to J7 in a time-dependent manner. However, the cytotoxic effects induced by co-treatment with J7 and TRAIL were markedly attenuated by caspase inhibitors, indicating an important role for caspases. Administration of N-acetyl cysteine, a scavenger of ROS, also resulted in significant inhibition of apoptosis induced by combinatory treatment with J7 and TRAIL. These results support a mechanism whereby J7 plus TRAIL induces apoptosis of HepG2 human hepatoma cells through a signaling cascade involving a ROS-mediated caspase pathway.
