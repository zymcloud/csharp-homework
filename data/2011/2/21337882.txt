As more therapies become available for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the management of patients with HCC is more complex, and the indications for the various therapeutic modalities are less clear. Although all of the treatment options have shown a certain efficacy in well-selected patient groups, their everyday use, especially in nonspecialized centers, is not always appropriate. We report our experience with 81 individuals who were diagnosed and treated in our institution between 2001 and 2007. Only patients who received transplants had good long-term outcomes, and we noted significant inconsistencies in the management of patients with similar stages of disease and degrees of cirrhosis. Despite recent progress, HCC still carries an overall dismal prognosis, making the optimization of the therapeutic plan mandatory to improve outcomes. We believe that a unified protocol, as well as the early involvement of the hepatology and transplant teams, can help physicians optimize the care of these patients.
