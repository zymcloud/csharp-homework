Purpose:The CyberKnife(®) system is a recent radiation therapy technique that allows treatment of liver lesions with real-time tracking. Because of its high precision, the dose administered to the tumor can be increased. We report Oscar-Lambret Cancer Centre experience in the treatment of primary and secondary liver lesions.Patients and methods:It is a retrospective study analyzing all the patients who have been treated for their liver lesions since July 2007. A hundred and twenty patients have been treated: 42 for hepatocellular carcinoma, 72 for liver metastases and six for cholangiocarcinoma. Gold seeds need to be implanted before the treatment and are used as markers to follow the movement of the lesion due to respiration. On average, the treatment is administered in three to four sessions over 12 days. A total dose of 40 to 45 Gy at the 80% isodose is delivered. Local control and overall survival analysis with Log-rank is performed for each type of lesion.Results:Treatment tolerance is good. The most common toxicities are of digestive type, pain and asthenia. Six gastro-duodenal ulcers and two radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) were observed. At a median follow-up of 15 months, the local control rate is respectively of 80.4% and 72.5% at 1 and 2 years. Overall survival is 84.6 and 58.3% at 1 and 2 years. The local control is significantly better for the hepatocellular carcinoma and overall survival is significantly better for liver metastases (PConclusion:CyberKnife(®) is a promising technique, well tolerated, with tumoral local control rates comparable to other techniques. Its advantage is that it is very minimally invasive delivered as an outpatient procedure in a frail population of patient (disease, age).
