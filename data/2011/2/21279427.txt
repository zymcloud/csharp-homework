In this minireview, the more recent findings about the effects of peculiar reactive thiol drugs on mitochondria are presented. These include the following compounds: metallo meso-tetrakis porphyrins, palladacycles, telluranes and phenothiazines. Metallo meso-tetrakis porphyrins can exhibit both beneficial and deleterious effects on mitochodria that are modulated by the central metal, cell location, and availability of axial ligands. Therefore, these compounds have the versatility to be used for cell and mitochondria protection and death. The antioxidant activity of manganese porphyrins is related to a glutathione peroxidase-like activity. By attacking exclusively the membrane protein thiol groups without glutathione depletion, palladacycles are able to induce mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and cytochrome c release in the absence of oxidative stress. In hepatoma cells, the mitochondrial action of palladacycles was able to induce apoptotic death. As opposed to palladacycles, telluranes and phenothiazines are able to conjugate the capacity to promote the MPT in a dose-dependent manner in association with efficient antioxidant activity toward lipids. These studies demonstrated that the action of drugs on mitochondrial bioenergetics can be modulated by peculiar reactivity with thiol groups. Therefore, they contribute to studies of toxicity as well as the design of new drugs.
