Objectives:determine the effect of double-dose gadoxetic-acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) on lesion-liver contrast ratio in arterial- and hepatocyte-phase images and arterial-phase image quality in patients with chronic liver disease.Materials and methods:the ethics committee at our institute approved this study. This study included 28 patients (13 with Child-Pugh class A and 15 with class B) with 54 hepatocellular carcinomas. All patients received the standard Gd-EOB-DTPA dose (0.025 mmol/kg bodyweight) and double dose (0.050 mmol/kg bodyweight). The lesion-liver contrast ratio was evaluated in arterial- and hepatocyte-phase images. The artifacts in arterial-phase images were evaluated with a 4-point scale. Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used for comparisons.Results:the hepatocyte-phase lesion-liver contrast ratio after the double dose was significantly higher than that after the standard dose in patients with Child-Pugh class B disease(standard dose vs. double dose; 0.20 ± 0.16 vs. 0.25 ± 0.17; P Conclusions:administration of double dose of Gd-EOB-DTPA provided better arterial enhancement of hepatocellular carcinomas in patients with chronic liver disease, and also improved the lesion-liver contrast in hepatocyte-phase images in patients with Child-Pugh class B disease.
