Hepatocellular carcinoma is now a major public health concern. In intermediate stages (one third of hepatocellular carcinoma patients), chemoembolization is the standard of care despite a poor tolerance and a moderate efficacy. Moreover, despite recent improvements, this technique seems in a dead end. Radioembolization could be an excellent tool for such patients. Currently (131)I-Lipiodol, (188)Re-Lipiodol, (90)Y-glass or resin microspheres are available. More recent and promising data come from microspheres, but phase II and III studies are needed before drawing any conclusion. In the future, the combination of radioembolization with systemic chemotherapy or targeted agents (particularly antiangiogenic drugs) seems very promising.
