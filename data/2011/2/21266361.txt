We report a novel function for the CD24 molecule in pancreatic cancer cells. Intracellular CD24 is associated with stress granules that contain specific mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins that regulate mRNA stability and translation. Intracellular CD24 in stress granules is associated with G3BP, a phosphorylation-dependent endoribonuclease. The vesicles in which the CD24/G3BP complex localizes are transported toward cell protrusions in migrating cells. We show that G3BP binds to and degrades Binder of Arl Two (BART) mRNA. BART was originally identified as a binding partner of ARL2, a small G-protein implicated as a regulator of microtubule dynamics and folding. Intracellular CD24 inhibits the specific endoribonuclease activity of G3BP toward BART mRNA in stress granules. We show that knockdown of CD24 increases retroperitoneal invasion and liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells in an orthotopic xenograft model, and that BART also prevents retroperitoneal invasion and liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. Our results imply that surface CD24 may play a role in the inhibition of cell invasion and metastasis, and that intracellular CD24 inhibits invasiveness and metastasis through its influence on the posttranscriptional regulation of BART mRNA levels via G3BP RNase activity.
