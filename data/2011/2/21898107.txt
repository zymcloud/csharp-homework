High rates of hepatitis B and C are present in Pakistan. Epidemiological surveys demonstrated an inverse association between selenium (Se) level and regional cancer incidence, as well as viral infection. In this cross-sectional descriptive analytical study, serum selenium concentration of 150 patients suffering from hepatitis B and C patients, along with 26 healthy controls, was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with hydride generation system. The mean and standard deviation of serum selenium concentration observed in male and female patients with hepatitis C were 101.60 ± 0.55 and 77.43 ± 0.47 μg/l, respectively, while the mean and standard deviation of serum selenium concentration observed in male and female patients with hepatitis B was 107.58 ± 0.44 and 137.8 ± 0.36 μg/l. Analysis of t test showed significant difference between hepatitis C and B (P < 0.001) patients in serum selenium concentration when compared with control.
