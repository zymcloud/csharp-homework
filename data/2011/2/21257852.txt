Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound with a perflubutane microbubble agent in the assessment of cellular differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Subjects and methods:Continuous harmonic imaging with a low mechanical index (0.21-0.30) was performed 1, 5, and 10 minutes after i.v. contrast injection (0.0075 mL/kg). Tumor enhancement was evaluated by both subjective reading and objective intensity analysis based on the signal distribution in the nontumor parenchyma. Tumor vascularity was assessed with CT during hepatic arteriography.Results:Sixty-four patients with 77 histologically proved HCCs (mean greatest dimension, 19.1 Â± 5.3 mm)--six poorly differentiated HCCs, 45 moderately differentiated HCCs, and 26 well-differentiated HCCs--were enrolled in this prospective study. Among 64 hyperenhancing lesions on peak enhancement sonograms, four poorly differentiated HCCs and eight moderately differentiated HCCs exhibited washout within 1 minute. In addition to these 12 lesions, 36 lesions exhibited washout 5 minutes after injection, resulting in a total of 48 washout lesions. Fifty-four lesions exhibited washout 10 minutes after contrast injection (six poorly differentiated, 38 moderately differentiated, and 10 well-differentiated HCCs). Washout was more frequent in poorly than in moderately differentiated HCC (p = 0.0117) and well-differentiated HCC (p = 0.0003) in the 1-minute phase and was more frequent in moderately differentiated than in well-differentiated HCC in the 5-minute (p = 0.0026) and 10-minute (p = 0.0117) phases. Thirteen lesions were isoenhancing or hypoenhancing on peak enhancement sonograms (three moderately differentiated and 10 well-differentiated HCCs). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound and CT during hepatic arteriography did not differ significantly with respect to rate of detection of hyperenhancing lesions.Conclusion:The findings at contrast-enhanced ultrasound with the perflubutane microbubble agent may be predictive of cellular differentiation of HCC without needle biopsy.
