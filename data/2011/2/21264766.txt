Surgery for retroperitoneal neoplasms with a tumor thrombus extension into the right atrium is challenging. This study reviewed four surgical cases of advanced stage malignant neoplasms with the tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium. The malignant neoplasms involved the kidney in two patients, and the liver and adrenal gland in one each. The tumor thrombus was removed through a longitudinal cavotomy and right atriotomy in all cases. The inferior vena cava reconstruction was performed by directly closing it in one patient and by pericardial patch suturing in another. Cardiopulmonary bypass was used for all procedures and a Pringle maneuver was used to reduce bleeding from the liver in three. There was no perioperative or hospital death. Two of the four with renal cell carcinoma were alive 7 and 13 months after the surgery. One with hepatocellular carcinoma died of recurrent malignancy after 4 months, while the patient with an adrenal carcinoma remained disease free after surgery. These cases indicate the safety of the present procedure. Although the long-term results are still unknown, there were favorable early results and a lack of perioperative complications. Surgical challenges in resecting an intracardiac extension of retroperitoneal malignancy require close cooperation among the attending urologist, and both gastrointestinal and cardiovascular surgeons.
