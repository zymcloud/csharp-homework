Background and objectives:To compare the effect on survival of anatomic resection (AR) versus nonanatomic resection (NAR) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from all published comparative studies in the literature.Methods:Databases, including Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Ovid, and Web of Science, were searched to identify studies comparing AR with NAR for HCC. In this meta-analysis, primary end points were the overall survival and disease-free survival; the secondary end point was local recurrence rate. The meta-analysis was performed by use of RevMan 4.2.Results:Nine comparative studies comprising 1,503 patients (833 AR and 670 NAR) were identified. In the combined results, disease-free survival was significantly higher in the AR group than in the NAR group (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.22-2.59, P = 0.003; heterogeneity P = 0.08). Overall survival (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.92-1.85, P = 0.13; heterogeneity P = 0.04) did not suggest any significant difference between AR and NAR. No statistically significant difference was found for local recurrence rate between the two resection methods (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.25-1.23, P = 0.15; heterogeneity P = 0.010).Conclusions:Anatomic resection is associated with better disease-free survival than nonanatomic resection. Because heterogeneity was detected, caution is needed in interpretation of the results. Better designed, adequately powered studies are required to address this issue.
