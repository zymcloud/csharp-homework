Substitution of amino acid (aa) 70 and/or 91 in the core region of HCV genotype 1b (HCV-1b) is an important predictor of hepatocarcinogenesis, but its impact on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following eradication of HCV RNA by antiviral therapy is not clear. 1,273 patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease, with sustained virological response, defined as negative HCV RNA at 24 weeks after cessation of interferon monotherapy or interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy, were included in a follow-up study to evaluate the impact of aa substitution in the core region on hepatocarcinogenesis. Twenty six patients developed HCC during the follow-up. The cumulative rates of new HCC were 3.2%, 4.8%, and 8.6% at the end of 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. The rates in patients infected with HCV-1b/Gln70(His70) [glutamine (histidine) at aa 70] were significantly higher than in patients infected with HCV-1b/Arg70 (arginine at aa 70) (P = 0.007; log-rank test) and HCV-2a/2b (P
