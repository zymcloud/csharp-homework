This study aimed to investigate the association of fasting insulin and glucose levels with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in a case-cohort study within a cohort (1989-2006) of 2903 male government employees chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Taiwan. Insulin, glucose and HBV-related factors were assayed in baseline plasma among 124 HCC cases and a random subcohort of 1084 of the total cohort. After adjustment for demographics and HBV-related factors, including viral load and genotype, the HCC risk was higher for the highest [>6.10 μU/ml, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.43-3.90] and lowest (6.10 μU/ml, HR = 6.15, 95% CI: 2.48-15.22). Higher insulin was also associated with an increased risk for cirrhosis diagnosed by ultrasonography and elevated alanine aminotransferase. No association with either cirrhosis or HCC was noted for glucose or diabetes after adjusting for insulin. In conclusion, elevated insulin levels are an independent risk factor for HCC among HBV carriers, especially for those with lower viral load.
