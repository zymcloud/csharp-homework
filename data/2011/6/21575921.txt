Iron overload is associated with an increased risk of liver complications including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Deferasirox is a new oral chelator with high iron-binding potency and selectivity. Here we investigate the ability of deferasirox to remove excessive hepatic iron and prevent iron-induced hepatic injury. Adult male Mongolian gerbils were divided into 3 groups (n=5/group)-control, iron overload (100 mg iron-dextran/kg body weight/5 days; intraperitoneal for 10 weeks), and iron overload followed by deferasirox treatment (100 mg deferasirox/kg body weight/d; pulse oral for 1 or 3 months). Compared with the nontreated iron overload group, deferasirox reduced hepatic iron concentration by 44% after 3 months of treatment (P
