Phenols are a large and diverse class of compounds, many of which occur naturally in a variety of food plants; they exhibit a wide range of biological effects, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, hepatoprotective, antithrombotic, antiviral, anticarcinogenic, and vasodilatory actions. We examined the genotoxic and clastogenic potential of three phenolic compounds: caffeic, cinnamic and ferulic acids, using the comet and micronucleus assays in vitro. Drug-metabolizing rat hepatoma tissue cells (HTCs) were used. Three different concentrations (50, 500 and 1500 Î¼M) of these phenolic acids were tested on the HTCs for 24 h. The caffeic, cinnamic and ferulic acids were not genotoxic by the comet assay (P > 0.05). However, the micronucleus test showed an increase in the frequency of micronucleated cells for the three compounds, indicating that these substances have clastogenic effects in HTC.
