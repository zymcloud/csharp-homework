The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in the USA. Traditional factors, such as hepatitis C and hepatitis B, along with new emerging trends suggest that the incidence is not only increasing, but is also likely to be under-represented in the current literature. Emerging knowledge of its incidence and epidemiology reflects an increased incidence in younger patients and certain ethnic groups. Without a clear treatment algorithm for this complex cancer, therapy and its utilization remain unclear.
