The aim of this study was to discuss the appearance of common complications from loco-regional therapy of primary and secondary malignant liver neoplasms on cross-sectional imaging. Knowledge of common complications is important for the safe performance of loco-regional therapy (LRT) and for the interpretation of post-LRT follow-up imaging. With careful patient selection, LRT represents an effective and safe treatment of primary and secondary hepatic malignancies; however, complications related to LRT methods infrequently lead to additional morbidity.
