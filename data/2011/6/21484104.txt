Background and aims:There are insufficient data comparing long-term prognoses after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgery.Methods:We compared the baseline characteristics and survival rates of patients (single, â‰¤3 cm, and Child-Pugh class A) treated surgically (n = 215) and with RFA (n = 255) from January 2000 to December 2007 at our institution.Results:The surgery group was characterized by younger age, higher prevalence of HBsAg, less cirrhosis, and an increased chance of Child-Pugh score of 5 and CLIP score of 1, compared to the RFA group. During the median follow-up period of 42 months (range 1-109), the 3-, 5- and 7-year overall survival rates in the surgery group were 98, 94, and 94%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the RFA group (92, 87, and 76%, respectively, P = 0.002). The 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 72 and 66%, respectively, in the surgery group, which were significantly higher than those in the RFA group (34 and 24%, respectively, P Conclusions:The long-term outcome after surgery for Child-Pugh class A and single small HCC is superior to that after RFA.
