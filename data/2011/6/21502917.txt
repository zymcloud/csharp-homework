The aim of this study was to investigate the synergic antitumor effects of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) on hepatoma cells and explore the possible molecular basis of these effects. These results showed that AZT enhanced the inhibitory effect of As2O3 on HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cell growth. The IC50 of As2O3 in combination with AZT was lower than that of As2O3 alone. A concentration-dependent synergic effect of As2O3 and AZT (CI
