Postembolization syndrome (PES) is a common complication after embolic procedures, and it is a frequent cause of extended inpatient hospital admissions. PES is a self-limited constellation of symptoms consisting of fevers, unremitting nausea, general malaise, loss of appetite, and variable abdominal pain following the procedure. Although a definite cause is unknown, this syndrome is thought to be a result of therapeutic cytotoxicity, tumor ischemia, and resulting intrahepatic and extrahepatic inflammation. The authors report a case of PES precipitated by transcatheter intrarterial chemoembolization of hepatic metastases.
