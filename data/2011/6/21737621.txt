Aim:To monitor the effects of the apoptotic agent benzamide riboside (BR) on tumor volume and water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Water ADC of the tumors and nearby liver tissue was measured using diffusion-weighted 1H MRI (DWI). The two groups of BR-treated animals, which differed in their sensitivity to the treatment, were identified as responsive (RBR) and non-responsive (NRBR).Results:Tumor growth in the RBR group was arrested and the mean tumor volume in this group was 1/6th and 1/16th compared to that of the NRBR group on days 7 and 14 after treatment, respectively. Water ADC of HCC was higher than in nearby normal liver tissue. Before BR treatment, the mean water ADC was significantly higher in the RBR group compared to the NRBR group. BR therapy did not change the water ADC value regardless of tumor sensitivity.Conclusion:Although the water ADC did not change after chemotherapy by BR, DWI has great potential for detecting and predicting response to chemotherapy in HCC.
