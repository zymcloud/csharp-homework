Synopsis:Major liver resection prevents intrahepatic tumor recurrence in T2 hepatocellular carcinoma patients with microvascular invasion or daughter nodules.Background and objectives:There is no consensus on whether major or minor hepatectomy is better for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. We investigated the outcomes of liver resection type in resectable HCC patients.Methods:Two hundred sixty-three HCC patients with Child-Pugh class A liver function who underwent curative hepatectomy were enrolled. Among them, 186 patients had pathologic stage T1 HCC and 77 had stage T2 HCC. Patients were also classed according to the type of resection (major or minor). Clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes were compared.Results:Patients with T1 HCC who underwent major resection had a higher rate of blood transfusion than those who underwent minor resection (P Conclusions:Major liver resection is recommended for T2 HCC patients with adequate remnant liver function because it results in a better disease-free survival rate than does minor resection in these patients. Minor liver resection is suggested for T1 HCC patients, except for those with a tumor sitting close to vessels, because it is associated with a low incidence of blood transfusion and a good survival rate.
