Background and objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks sixth regarding prevalence and third regarding mortality among malignant tumours worldwide. The aim of the present study was to determine changes of clinical-epidemiological parameters and survival rates during two decades.Patients and methods:A total of 441 consecutive patients with HCC admitted to the University Clinic DÃ¼sseldorf between January 1988 and December 2007 were included. For comparison, this time period was divided into two decades (1988 - 1997 and 1998 - 2007).Results:The number of newly diagnosed HCCs has tripled in the years 1998 - 2007 compared to the years 1988 - 1997. HCV-associated HCCs increased from 28 % in the years 1988 - 1997 to 38 % (p Conclusion:Improved screening as well as broader and improved treatment options may have contributed to the increasing survival rates.
