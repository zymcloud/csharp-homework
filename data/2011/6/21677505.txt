The case was a 58-year-old woman who visited our hospital for a thorough examination after multiple liver tumors were found in her at a nearby hospital. By liver tumor biopsy, we diagnosed them as carcinoid. Bone scintigraphy showed an abnormal accumulation in the external left scapula and in both of her hip joints, but the primary lesion was unclear. She died 8 years and 5 months after disease onset from deterioration of liver lesions, inspite of our treatments, such as gemcitabine administration of systemic chemotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for liver lesions, and radiation therapy for bone lesions. Pathological anatomy suggested a pancreatic, well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.
