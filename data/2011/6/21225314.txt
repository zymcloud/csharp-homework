Purpose:Studies indicate that recombinant human endostatin (rh-endostatin) can inhibit tumor endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. This study assessed the efficacy of the combination of standard gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy with rh-endostatin in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Patients and methods:Chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB to IV NSCLC were randomly (1:1) assigned to receive gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy alone or with 7.5 mg/ m(2) of intravenously rh-endostatin on days 1 to 14 of each 3-week cycle. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR).Results:Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms. The best ORRs for rh-endostatin arm (n = 33) and chemotherapy-alone arm were 37.5% (95% CI: 21.3 to 47.2%) and 28.6% (95% CI: 19.8 to 37.6%), respectively. Median survival was 12.4 months in the rh-endostatin arm and 9.8 months in the chemotherapy-alone arm, and 1-year survival was 51.6% and 38.7%, respectively. Mild palpitions, diarrhea, and liver dysfunction were the most common rh-endostatin-related adverse events. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicities were all reported similar for patients in the two arms.Conclusion:The addition of rh-endostatin to gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy for first-line treatment of NSCLC improves objective response and may improve survival.
