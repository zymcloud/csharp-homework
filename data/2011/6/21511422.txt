Objective:To evaluate the long-term outcome of CT-guided single high-dose percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI) for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC).Materials and methods:Sixty-eight consecutive patients (37 men and 31 women; age 52 ± 16 years) with SHCC have undergone CT-guided single high-dose PAI therapy since December 2000. Complications of high-dose PAI were recorded. Tumour survival and recurrence rates were assessed.Results:All PAI therapies were successful and no severe complications developed. The average follow-up period was 46 ± 18 months. The overall survival rates at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years were 93%, 82%, 68%, 59% and 51%, respectively. The cumulative local recurrence rates for the main tumour at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years were 18%, 22%, 25%, 28% and 28%, respectively. The cumulative new tumour recurrence rates at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years were 24%, 40%, 43%, 60% and 62%, respectively.Conclusion:CT-guided single high-dose PAI is safe and effective for the treatment of SHCC after long-term follow-up.
