Purpose:To evaluate long-term effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR)-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. In 20 patients, 28 HCCs (mean diameter, 28.0 mm; range, 6-58 mm) were treated with 25 sessions of MR-guided RF ablation. Previous chemoembolization had been performed in nine HCCs with diameters greater than 3 cm. The entire RF ablation procedures were carried out on a 0.2-T open MR system. Placement of MR-compatible internally cooled electrodes was performed under MR fluoroscopic imaging with fast gradient-echo sequences. Therapeutic assessment was based on dynamic MR-imaging (1.5 T) at a mean follow-up of 24.2 months (range, 6-52 mo).Results:MR-guided RF ablation was technically successful in all 25 sessions (100%), as assessed at the end of each session. T2-weighted sequences were accurate to monitor the ablation zone and supported guidance of overlapping ablations if necessary. Technique effectiveness, defined as complete ablation confirmed at MR imaging 4 months after RF ablation, was achieved in 27 of 28 HCCs (96.4%). To achieve complete ablation, 25 of 27 tumors (92.6%) were treated in a single session and two tumors were treated twice. In one tumor initially defined as having been treated with technically effective RF ablation, local tumor progression was detected more than 4 months after ablation. Consequently, the available follow-up indicated complete ablation in 26 of 28 HCCs (92.9%). There was one major complication (4.0%) and one minor complication (4.0%).Conclusions:On a long-term basis, MR-guided RF ablation is an effective therapy option in the treatment of HCC.
