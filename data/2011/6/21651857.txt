Aim:The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and the distribution of Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in several human hepatocellular cancer cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, SMMC-7721).Methods:Flow cytometry was used to figure out the percentages of Nrf2-positive cells in these three cell lines. The localization of Nrf2 was estimated by the laser confocal microsopy and the expression levels of Nrf2 in hepatocellular cancer cell lines were detected by Western blot analysis.Results:The percentages of Nrf2 positive cells in HepG2, Hep3B, and SMMC-7721 were 99.39%, 99.94%, and 99.98% through the flow cytometry. The laser confocal microsopy showed that Nrf2 mainly localized in the cytoplasm of HepG2 cells, distributed evenly in the cytoplasm and nucleus of Hep3B cells, and mainly localized in the nucleus of SMMC-7721 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the result by the laser confocal microsopy.Conclusion:The data on the expression and localization of Nrf2 will be helpful for the following research on the role of Nrf2 in the drug resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma to chemotherapy.
