Objective:The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic capability of hepatic dynamic CT with low-dose contrast material (420 mg I/kg body weight) at 80 kVp with that of the same modality performed with standard-dose contrast material at 120 kVp.Subjects and methods:We randomly assigned 111 patients (50 women, 61 men; mean age, 69.1 years) with known or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma and a body weight of 70 kg or less to one of two protocols. In the 80-kVp protocol, the contrast material (444 mg I/kg body weight) was delivered over 15 seconds at a tube voltage of 80 kVp. In the 120-kVp protocol, a contrast dose of 600 mg I/kg was delivered over 30 seconds at 120 kVp. Of the 111 patients, 38 had hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, we compared the two protocols for the contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumors (difference between tumor attenuation and liver attenuation divided by noise in the liver) and the figure of merit (square of contrast-to-noise ratio divided by effective dose) of the tumors during the arterial phase of imaging. Effective doses also were compared.Results:The contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumors was significantly higher with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (median, 5.3 vs 4.2; p = 0.04). The figure of merit also was significantly higher with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (10.2 vs 5.3, p = 0.02). The effective dose was significantly lower with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (2.97 vs 3.41 mSv, p Conclusion:With 80-kVp acquisition, the contrast-to-noise ratio and figure of merit of tumors during the arterial phase improved despite the lower contrast dose and radiation exposure.
