Chemoprevention, a useful and attractive approach in experimental oncology, helps to investigate the cancer preventive potential of natural products and synthetic entities. Present study evaluated the chemopreventive potential of glycyrrhetinic acid in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis. Oral tumor was developed in the buccal pouch of golden Syrian hamsters by painting with DMBA three times a week for 14 weeks. The tumor incidence and the status of phase I and phase II detoxification enzymes were assessed in hamsters treated with DMBA alone and DMBA+glycyrrhetinic acid treated hamsters. One hundred percent tumor formations, which were histopathologically confirmed as well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, were observed in hamsters treated with DMBA alone. Also, the status of detoxification enzymes were markedly altered in the liver and buccal mucosa of hamsters treated with DMBA alone. Oral administration ofglycyrrhetinic acid at a dose of 45 mg kg(-1) body weight to hamsters treated with DMBA completely prevented the tumor formation as well as restored the status of detoxification enzymes. Present study thus demonstrated the chemopreventive potential of glycyrrhetinic acid in DMBA induced oral carcinogenesis.
