Background:Sorafenib is an orally active multikinase inhibitor licensed for the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:The web-based registry, used for appraisal on new drugs, allows developing the observational prospective analysis of innovative drug therapies. To establish clinical impact of Sorafenib, institutional data were collected prospectively through the registry.Results:A total of 81 patients treated with Sorafenib were reviewed (median age = 65 years) and the follow-up duration was 30 months. Every patient was checked for length of treatment, toxicity and outcomes. Based on the study sample, the median time to progression was 3 months and median overall survival was 8 months. We found 52% progressions at first evaluation and the disease control rate was 32%.Conclusion:Our data from real life practice showed that the clinical benefit of Sorafenib in unresectable HCC was gained in selected responder patients.
