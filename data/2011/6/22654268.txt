The authors present a case of radiation-induced biliary stricture following yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma. Biliary complications (e.g., biliary stricture, biliary necrosis, biloma) following radioembolization and other locoregional therapies are uncommon and usually managed conservatively. In instances when biliary injury is refractory to medical management, as in the case presented herein, endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical intervention may be required. Timely diagnosis of biliary complications with correlation to liver function permits optimal clinical management of patients undergoing (90)Y radioembolization.
