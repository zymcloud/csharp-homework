Purpose:This study was designed to retrospectively compare the effectiveness of combined transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with that of RFA alone in patients with medium-sized (3.1-5.0 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From March 2000 to April 2010, 57 patients, each with a single medium-sized HCC, were treated with combined TACE and RFA, and 66 were treated with RFA alone.Results:During follow-up (mean, 42.5 Â± 33.2 months; range, 2.6-126.2 months), local tumor progression was observed in 40% of treated lesions in the combined treatment group and in 70% in the RFA-alone group. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year local tumor progression rates were significantly lower in the TACE + RFA group (9%, 40%, 55%, and 66%, respectively) than in the RFA-alone group (45%, 76%, 86%, and 89%, respectively; P Conclusions:The combination of TACE and RFA is safe and provides better local tumor control than RFA alone for the treatment of patients with medium-sized HCC. Our multivariate analysis showed that RFA-alone treatment and Child-Pugh class B were poor independent factors for determining the patient survival period.
