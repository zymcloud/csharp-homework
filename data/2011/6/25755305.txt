Objectives:There are paucity of information about prevalence and risk factor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Bangladesh.Methods:Blood was collected from 1018 randomly selected subjects from a semi-urban area of Bangladesh. Anti-HCVs were checked in the blood twice using a third-generation commercial kit. The data of the questionnaires were analyzed to find possible risk factors.Results:Nine of the 1018 subjects (88%) were tested positive for anti-HCV. The HCV-positive subjects were >28 years old. Major risk factors for HCV infection were treatment by unqualified and traditional practitioners, history of mass-vaccination against smallpox, hair cutting and shaving by barbers, and body piercing. However, known risk factors such as blood transfusion, surgery, invasive therapy, and intravenous drug use were not detected in any HCV-infected subjects.Conclusion:Control of HCV infection in Bangladesh may be difficult because the risk factors are related to normal tradition and culture of Bangladeshi people.
