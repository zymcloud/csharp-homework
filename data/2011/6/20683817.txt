Hepatic lobar atrophy-hypertrophy complex formation is an uncommonly reported sequella of hepatic arterial embolotherapy procedures. Whereas radiation-induced hepatic lobar ablation has been described after intra-arterial therapy with yttrium-90 microspheres, this phenomenon has not been reported after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Here, we report a case of prominent hepatic lobar atrophy with contralateral lobar hypertrophy after chemoembolization and suggest a mechanism by which arterial embolization contributes to the volumetric response.
