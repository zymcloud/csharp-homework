The aim of the study was the analysis of the results of liver resection in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, taking into consideration the selected factors based on the department's material.Material and methods:Data of 122 patients subject to liver resection due to hepatocellular carcinoma at the Department of General, Transplantation and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, were subject to retrospective analysis. The influence of selected factors on the long-term treatment results was determined, and the patient survival depending on the tumor stage as per the TNM scale was compared. The statistical significance threshold was set at p = 0.05.Results:1- and 3-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival in the whole patient group was 82.1% and 56.3%, and 57.7% and 20.1%, respectively. The perioperative mortality rate was 1.6%. The neoplasm advancement exceeding the first stage on the TNM scale was associated with lower values of overall survival (p = 0.001, HR = 3.7) and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.00008, HR = 3.8). Elevation of AFP was the only independent prognostic factor for overall survival (p = 0.04, HR = 1.04 at alpha-fetoprotein levels > 1000 ng/ml), while the presence of neoplastic emboli in small blood vessels was an independent risk factor for HCC recurrence (p = 0.02, HR = 2.24).Conclusions:The alpha-fetoprotein levels and presence in the histopathological examination of neoplastic emboli in small blood vessels are independent prognostic factors for outcome of patients operated for hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis of neoplasm at stage 1 as per TNM significantly improves long-term results of resective treatment.
