Long-term changes in the frequency and outcome of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection have seldom been analysed. This retrospective, longitudinal study includes 398 consecutive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients with anti-HDV antibodies who attended our institution between 1983 and 2008. At enrolment, 182 patients had acute and 216 chronic hepatitis. Patients were grouped into two periods. Those who attended between 1983 and 1995 and those between 1996 and 2008. The former group was significantly younger, mainly intravenous drugs users, and had a greater incidence of acute HDV and HIV and HCV coinfection. Patients with acute HBV/HDV coinfection cleared both infections in 90% of cases, while all patients with HDV superinfection evolved to chronic disease. One hundred and fifty-eight patients with chronic HDV were followed for a median period of 158months. Seventy-two per cent of the patients remained stable, 18% had hepatic decompensation, 3% developed hepatocellular carcinoma, and 8% cleared HBsAg. Liver-related death was observed in 13% of patients and mainly occurred in patients from the first period (P=0.012). These results indicate an outbreak of HDV at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, with a large number of acute HDV cases affecting predominately young, male intravenous drug users. Currently, patients with chronic HDV disease are older, and factors associated with worse prognosis include the presence of cirrhosis and age at the time of diagnosis.
