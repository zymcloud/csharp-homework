Background:In a previous study, we reported a critical role of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) in the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and documented it to be a prognostic biomarker as well as a potential therapeutic target for HCC. However, the role of EGFL8, the only known paralog of EGFL7, in human malignancies is currently unclear.Patients and methods:EGFL8 expression in 101 cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the clinicopathological features of the CRC patients were correlated with the EGFL8 down-regulation scores. In addition, the survival curve and Cox regression model were also employed to assess the prognostic value of EGFL8 down-regulation.Results:EGFL8 was significantly decreased in CRC tissues (pConclusion:The reduced expression of EGFL8 is closely related to metastastic potential and poor prognosis of CRC, suggesting the down-regulation of EGFL8 as a novel prognostic biomarker for CRC patients.
