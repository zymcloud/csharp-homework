Objective:Patients with end-stage renal disease are suggestive to have a higher risk for the development of some kinds of cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible association between malignancy and end-stage renal disease in Taiwan.Methods:We used the data of the National Health Insurance system of Taiwan to assess this issue. The end-stage renal disease cohort contained 21 817 patients, and each patient was randomly frequency-matched with two people from the general population without end-stage renal disease based on their age and sex. The Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to estimate the effects of end-stage renal disease on the cancer risk.Results:In patients with end-stage renal disease, the risk of developing overall cancer was significantly higher than the normal healthy subjects (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.64, 95% confidence interval = 1.54-1.74). This was also true when we analyzed males and females separately. For individual cancer, the risks for developing urinary tract cancers, liver cancer and breast cancer among patients with end-stage renal disease were significantly higher. On the contrary, lung, prostate and esophageal cancer risks were significantly lower when compared with the normal healthy subjects.Conclusions:Our study found Taiwanese patients with end-stage renal disease to have a higher risk to develop urinary tract, liver and breast cancer. We unexpectedly discovered these patients to have a lower risk to get lung, prostate and esophageal cancer.
