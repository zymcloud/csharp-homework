Background:Single-port laparoscopic surgery is slowly but steadily gaining popularity among surgeons performing minimally invasive abdominal surgeries. The aim of the present study is to assess our initial experience with single-port laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Between March 2009 and April 2011, 24 patients underwent single-port laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. Of these, 13 were laparoscopic segmentectomies, 4 were laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomies, 1 was a right hepatectomy, 1 was a left hepatectomy, and 4 were nonanatomical resections.Results:Median operating time and blood loss were 205 min (95-545 min) and 500 ml (100-2,500 ml), respectively. Two procedures were converted to multiport laparoscopic hepatectomy due to instrument length limitations, and four were converted to open surgery. There were no serious intraoperative or postoperative complications in this series. Median postoperative stay was 8.5 days (5-16 days).Conclusions:Although the procedure requires a lot of technical expertise added to the skill of liver surgery, single-port laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma seems a feasible approach in a variety of well-selected cases. In spite of the demanding nature of the procedure and the requirement of better instrumentation for single-port laparoscopic surgery, the results seem to compare favorably with conventional laparoscopic surgery and open surgery.
