Purpose:This phase I study assessed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of SJG-136, a sequence-specific DNA cross-linking agent, in patients with advanced cancer.Experimental design:In schedule A, seven patients received escalating doses of SJG-136 (6, 12, 24, and 48 μg/m(2)) daily for 5 of 21 days. Blood samples were collected for PK analysis on days 1 and 5 of cycle 1. In schedule B, SJG-136 was given daily for 3 of 21 days (N = 17; doses 20, 25, 30, and 35 μg/m(2)). Blood samples were collected on days 1 and 3 of cycles 1 and 2 for PK and PD analysis. Patients in schedule B received dexamethasone and early diuretic care.Results:Schedule A-dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 edema, dyspnea, fatigue, and delayed liver toxicity (grade 3-4). PK analysis revealed dose-dependent increases in AUC and C(max). Substantial changes in volume of distribution at steady-state occurred after repeated dosing in some patients prior to the onset of edema. Schedule B-the same toxicities were manageable with steroid premedication and diuretic support. No significant myelosuppression occurred on either schedule. DNA interstrand cross-links correlated with systemic exposure of SJG-136 following the second dose in cycle 1 and were still detectable immediately before cycle 2.Conclusions:The MTD of SJG-136 in this study was 30 μg/m(2) administered on a daily 3× basis with no myelosuppression effects. Coupled with supportive management, SJG-136 is now advancing to a phase II trial in ovarian cancer.
