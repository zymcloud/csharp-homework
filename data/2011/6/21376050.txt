Background & aims:High-level coffee consumption has been associated with reduced progression of pre-existing liver diseases and lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its relationship with therapy for hepatitis C virus infection has not been evaluated.Methods:Patients (n=885) from the lead-in phase of the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment Against Cirrhosis Trial recorded coffee intake before retreatment with peginterferon α-2a (180 μg/wk) and ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day). We assessed patients for early virologic response (2 log10 reduction in level of hepatitis C virus RNA at week 12; n=466), and undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA at weeks 20 (n=320), 48 (end of treatment, n=284), and 72 (sustained virologic response; n=157).Results:Median log10 drop from baseline to week 20 was 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.6-3.9) among nondrinkers and 4.0 (IQR, 2.1-4.7) among patients that drank 3 or more cups/day of coffee (P trendConclusions:High-level consumption of coffee (more than 3 cups per day) is an independent predictor of improved virologic response to peginterferon plus ribavirin in patients with hepatitis C.
