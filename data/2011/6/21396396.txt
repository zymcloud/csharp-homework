Glycan were isolated from Cynomorium songaricum and flavone was extracted from Ginkgo leaf. This glycan was well fractionated into three fractions (CSG-F1, CSG-F1, and CSG-F3). The spectra were recorded at the absorbance mode from 4000 to 400 cm(-1) (mid infrared region) at the resolution of 8 cm(-1). The fourier transform infrared (IR) spectrum displayed a broad peak at 3438 cm(-1) and 2928 cm(-1) that corresponded to the stretching vibration of -OH group. The Ginkgo leaf flavone markedly inhibited the growth of human liver carcinoma cell line HepG2. However, C. songaricum glycan did not displayed strong antitumor activity.
