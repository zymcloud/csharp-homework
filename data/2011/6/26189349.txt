A 67-year-old male patient presenting with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) following 6 months of treatment with 6 million units of beta-interferon (IFN). The SVR state continued for 6 years. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed in liver segments 4 and 5, and was treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, followed by radiofrequency ablation of the tumors. A recurrence of HCC occurred in segment 4 one and a half years after the initial treatment for HCC and a new tumor also developed in segment 8. These tumors were diagnosed to be recurrent HCC, and the three hepatic segments were resected. The pathological examination and immunostaining of the tumors revealed the tumor in segment 4 to be a well to moderately differentiated typical HCC. On the other hand, the tumor in segment 8 was a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and was diagnosed as an intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC). HCC developed from CHC in a patient who achieved a 6-year SVR after IFN therapy, followed one and a half years later by the development of a heterochronous ICC at a different site, thus indicating the presence of HCC-ICC double cancer. This was an exceedingly rare and clinically important case in terms of the carcinogenic mechanism of HCC and ICC from a post-SVR CHC patient. We have to be aware of the possible development not only of HCC but of ICC after SVR in CHC patients.
