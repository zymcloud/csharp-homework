Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment in patients with unresectable non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). New drug eluting beads aim at improving efficacy of TACE in retaining as long as possible the anticancer drug within the tumor. Our monocentric study compares direct hospital medical costs, according to two different methods, for a first course of conventional TACE and for a first course of TACE using drug eluting beads in 30 patients with HCC. The average cost of a first course of conventional TACE valued by the analytic accounting system is 4 332 € versus 3 577 € for a first course of TACE using drug eluting beads. The average cost of a first course of conventional TACE valued by the official tariffs from the new French Diagnosis Related Group prospective payment system is 4 507 € (+175 €) versus 2 852 € (-725 €) for a first course of TACE using drug eluting beads. Our study shows that a first TACE using drug eluting beads, valued by the official tariffs from the new French Diagnosis Related Group prospective payment system, is significantly (p = 0.006) less expensive than a first conventional TACE.
