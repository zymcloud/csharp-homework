Objective:The aim of this study was to diagnose microvascular invasion in patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from pre-operative CT imaging.Methods:102 patients with solitary HCC who underwent curative hepatectomy were retrospectively included in our study. The pre-operative 3-phase CT imaging and laboratory data for the 102 patients were reviewed. Tumour size, tumour margin, peritumoral enhancement and Î±-fetoprotein level were assessed. Surgical pathology was reviewed; tumour differentiation, liver fibrosis score and microvascular invasion were recorded.Results:The histopathological results revealed that 50 HCCs were positive and the other 52 were negative for microvascular invasion. Univariate analysis revealed that tumour size (p = 0.036), higher Edmondson-Steiner grade (p = 0.047) and non-smooth tumour margin (p Conclusion:Non-smooth tumour margin in pre-operative CT had a statistically significant association with microvascular invasion. More aggressive treatment should be considered in HCC patients with suspected positive microvascular invasion.
