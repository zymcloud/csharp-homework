Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been shown to be a potential risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease in liver transplant recipients.Methods:We performed a retrospective cohort study of 307 patients with and without HCV cirrhosis and preserved pretransplant renal function (serum creatinineResults:One hundred eighty-one patients were transplanted for HCV cirrhosis and 126 recipients had other causes of liver disease. Mean model for end-stage liver disease scores were 21.64 in the HCV group and 21.30 in the non-HCV group (P=0.58); 51% of patients in the HCV cohort had hepatocellular carcinoma compared with 27% in the non-HCV cohort (PConclusions:Patients with HCV cirrhosis and normal preliver transplant renal function do not have worse posttransplant renal outcomes compared with those with other causes of liver disease.
