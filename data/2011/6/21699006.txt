A 66 year old woman with end-stage renal disease and liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C virus infection was introduced to hemodialysis therapy in 2003. In 2007, hepatocellular carcinoma was identified and the patient underwent radio frequency ablation (RFA) and ethanol injection therapy (EIT) under laparotomy. A large vaginal tumor was incidentally found at gynecological examination. Histological diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Stage IE). During the first course of chemotherapy, the vaginal tumor began to prolapse from the vaginal wall due to an excellent response to the chemotherapy and finally was resected. The patient received another course of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The vaginal tumor was undetectable in the follow-up imaging studies. Although patients with end-stage renal disease are at increased risk for several cancers, the occurrence of malignant lymphoma following hepatocellular carcinoma is rare. Furthermore, lymphomas arising from the female genital tract are very uncommon.
