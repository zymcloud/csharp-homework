Aims:Solitary large hepatocellular carcinoma (SL-HCC), a novel subtype with relative good prognosis, has recently been defined. However, the concept has not been validated. Besides, prognostic factors of SL-HCC remain unknown. The present study is designed to address the issues.Materials and methods:Clinicopathological variables and survival of consecutive 85 patients with SL-HCC after curative resection are compared with those of 48 patients with small HCC (SHCC). The prognosticators of SL-HCC are also evaluated.Results:Disease-free survival of SL-HCC is similar with that of SHCC, whereas significant poorer overall survival is observed in SL-HCC than that in SHCC, accompanied by more frequent vascular invasion, later TNM stage and potentially higher Edmondson-Steiner grade. Vascular invasion, Edmondson-Steiner grade, TNM stage and preoperative AFP level impact overall and/or disease-free survival of SL-HCC, but only Edmondson-Steiner grade is independent. Additionally, differences in both overall and disease-free survival between SL-HCC with Edmondson-Steiner grade I-II and SHCC are all not significant.Conclusions:Factors predictive for prognosis of SL-HCC are all tumor-related. The involvement of differentiation grade might be helpful for further distinguishing a particularly good outcome in SL-HCC.
