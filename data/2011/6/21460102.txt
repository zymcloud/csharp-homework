Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) emerges as a crucial player in tumor progression. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially its relation with global DNA methylation patterns in HCC under hypoxic tumor microenvironment is not completely understood. Methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) maintains the homeostasis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a critical marker of genomic methylation status. In this study, we investigated the link between HIF-1α and MAT2A as a mechanism responsible for the change in genomic DNA methylation patterns in liver cancer under hypoxia conditions. Our results showed that hypoxia induces genomic DNA demethylation in CpG islands by reducing the steady-state SAM level both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, HIF-1α and MAT2A expression is correlated with tumor size and TNM stage of liver cancer tissues. We further showed that hypoxia-induced MAT2A expression is HIF-1α dependent and requires the recruitment of p300 and HDAC1. We also identified an authentic consensus HIF-1α binding site in MAT2A promoter by site-directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Taken together, we show for the first time that hypoxia induces genomic DNA demethylation through the activation of HIF-1α and transcriptional upregulation of MAT2A in hepatoma cells. These findings provide new insights into our understanding of the molecular link between genomic DNA methylation and tumor hypoxia in HCC.
