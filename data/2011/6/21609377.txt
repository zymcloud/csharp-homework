Objective:To evaluate any change in the operative and survival outcomes in patients undergoing a right hepatectomy after adoption of the no-clamp technique using a radiofrequency dissecting sealer (TissueLink™) in liver resection.Methods:In all, 58 consecutive patients who underwent a right hepatectomy from July 2003 to December 2007 (Group 1) were compared with 66 consecutive patients who underwent a right hepatectomy from January 1999 to June 2003 (Group 2). In group 1, a liver transection was performed with a cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) and TissueLink™ without hilar clamping whereas in group 2, a liver transection was performed with CUSA and diathermy with routine continuous hilar clamping.Results:For the operative outcomes, there was significantly less blood loss (median 450 vs. 900 ml, P Conclusions:When compared with the retrospective cohort, a right hepatectomy utilizing TissueLink™ without hilar clamping was feasible with potential benefits in surgical outcomes.
