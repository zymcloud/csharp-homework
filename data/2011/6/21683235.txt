Survivors of childhood cancer have a higher risk of developing a secondary neoplasm in their lifetime. The increased risk of a second malignant neoplasm is related to treatment of the primary tumor and genetic predisposition. We describe a 19-year-old man with 2 hepatic masses, one of which was diagnosed as a hepatic angiomyolipoma and the other as focal nodular hyperplasia 14 years after the treatment of stage IV pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma. The combination of these tumors has not previously been reported in the literature.
