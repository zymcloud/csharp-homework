Peritoneal seeding (PS) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is uncommon, and the clinicopathological features are poorly understood. A total of 181 autopsy cases of HCC, including 171 cases with detailed clinical information, was investigated for PS and evaluated. PS was identified in 17 cases (9.4%), and was locally (70.6%) or entirely (29.4%) distributed in the peritoneal cavity, involving the diaphragm (76.5%), omentum (47.1%), or alimentary tract serosa (47.1%). Compared with primary HCC, PS showed similar or slightly undifferentiated features (88.2%) and exhibited more differentiated features (11.8%). In 15 cases (88.2%) of HCC with PS, primary HCC showed membranous Î²-catenin immunoreactivity. However, in five cases (33.3%), respective PS lost this immunoreactivity. PS was significantly associated with rupture of HCC (P= 0.012), direct diaphragmatic invasion (P= 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P
