Telangiectatic hepatocellular adenoma is a rare, recently recognized subtype of hepatocellular adenoma that is often underrecognized by pathologists. We report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma arising within a pigmented telangiectatic hepatocellular adenoma in a noncirrhotic man with diffuse glutamine synthetase and nuclear β-catenin positivity. This case highlights malignant transformation of telangiectatic adenomas, and describes a previously unreported association between pigment deposition and telangiectatic adenoma. Radiology, gross pathology, and histopathology are shown. Review of the literature with attention to β-catenin and glutamine synthetase staining, malignant transformation, patient characteristics, the presence of Dubin-Johnson-like pigment, and genetic characteristics of telangiectatic adenomas are discussed.
