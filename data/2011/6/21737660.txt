Urachal cancer is a rare malignancy and the standard treatment is surgical resection. The prognosis of recurrent and metastatic urachal cancer is extremely poor because there is no established chemotherapy regimen. Here, the response of one patient with recurrent urachal cancer to combination chemotherapy of gemcitabine (GEM) and cisplatin (CDDP) (GC) is described. And the chemo- and radiotherapeutic regimens available for such patients are reviewed. A 67-year-old man diagnosed with stage IIIA urachal cancer underwent complete surgical resection. However, pelvic recurrence was detected on computed tomography (CT) 5 months after surgery. GC therapy was started immediately and resulted in a pronounced reduction in pelvic mass after three cycles. However, a follow-up CT scan taken 5 months later showed growth of the pelvic mass and new liver metastasis. He received GC therapy again, which resulted in reduction of the pelvic and liver metastatic masses after two cycles. However, the patient refused another course of GC therapy due to severe side-effects. Subsequent progression of the disease included spread in both regions, followed by death 16 months after recurrence. Various treatment strategies offer relatively long survival of patients with urachal cancer including those with recurrence and metastasis. Although further studies are necessary to determine its therapeutic efficacy, GC therapy may be a useful option in the treatment of urachal tumors, including recurrent tumours.
