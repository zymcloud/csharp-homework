Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a well known agent of acute and chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Around 400 million people worldwide carrier of HBV of which more than 250 million reside in Asia, and 1-2 million people have died from it. It has a partially double-stranded DNA, having 3.2-kb genome size and replicate via reverse transcription of RNA intermediate. In the natural history or during the antiviral therapy of chronic HBV infection, seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBeAg is usually accompanied by a decrease in viral replication and remission of liver disease. Based on genomic sequence data HBV is classified into eight genotypes A-H and four major serotypes ayw, ayr, adw and adr on the basis of complete genome and S gene sequence analysis. Genotypes and serotypes are useful tools in understanding the epidemiology of HBV infection. HBV genotypes have distinct geographical distributions. The HBV variants appear during HBeAg seroconversion and they bring mutations in the precore region (PC) that prevent HBeAg synthesis. Another common HBeAg variant is the basal core promoter mutant (BCP) characterized by point mutation in the promoter of both HBeAg mRNA and core protein mRNA. The most frequent core promoter mutation is the double A1762T and G1764A nucleotide exchange, which results in a substantial decrease in HBeAg expression but enhanced viral genome replication. The approved antiviral drugs such as Interferon, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir and telbivudine for purpose of treating chronic HBV infection is to prevent or stop the progression of liver injury by suppressing viral replication or eliminating infection. Sustained losses of viral markers of active viral replication (HBeAg and HBV DNA) are the standard end point of the therapies.
