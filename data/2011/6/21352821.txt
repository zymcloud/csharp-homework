There is a need for a nontoxic antioxidant agent to be identified which will prevent alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in alcoholic patients. We tested 4 candidate agents: quercetin, EGCG, catechin and betaine, all of which occur naturally in food. HepG2 cells overexpressing CYP2E1 were subjected to arachidonic acid, iron and 100mM ethanol with or without the antioxidant agent. All the agents prevented oxidative stress and MDA/4HNE formation induced by ethanol, except for EGCG. Catechin prevented CYP2E1 induction by ethanol. All the agents tended to down-regulate the ethanol-induced increased expression of glutathionine peroxidase 4 (GPX4). All the agents, except catechin, tended to reduce the expression of SOD2 induced by ethanol. Heat shock protein 70 was up-regulated by ethanol alone and betaine tended to prevent this. All 4 agents down-regulated the expression of Gadd45b in the presence of ethanol, which could explain the mechanism of DNA demethylation associated with the up-regulation of the gene expression observed in experimental ALD. In conclusion, the in vitro model of oxidative stress induced by ethanol provided evidence that all 4 agents tested prevented some aspect of liver cell injury caused by ethanol.
