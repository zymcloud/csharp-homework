The life of patients with thalassemia has improved both in duration and in quality in industrialized countries. Complications are still common and include heart disease (heart failure and arrhythmias), chronic liver hepatitis, which can evolve in cirrhosis and, rarely, in hepatocellular carcinoma, endocrine problems (hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, diabetes, hypoparathyroidism), stunted growth, osteoporosis, thrombophilia and pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The incidence of complications is decreasing in younger cohorts of patients who have been transfused with blood that has been screened for viruses and thanks to the introduction of new oral iron chelators and imaging methods. The accurate measurement of iron deposits allows better management of iron overload. In addition, therapy for several complications is available. Specialized competence in treating patients with thalassemia is of great importance.
