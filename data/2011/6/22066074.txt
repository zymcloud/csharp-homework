A case report described a 72-year-old man with a history of a deceased-donor liver transplantation (due to hepatitis B-associated end-stage liver cirrhosis) performed in 1994. The patient was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma and pulmonary metastasis in 1997 and was successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation and thoracoscopic superior segmentectomy. There was no evidence of newly diagnosed metastatic lesions or recurrence until the 19th post-operative month. Gastric cancer was identified by endoscopy during a routine follow-up examination; the pre-pyloric antral lesion measured 1.5 cm in size and was histologically well-differentiated and confined to the submucosal layers on endoscopic ultrasound. Laparoscopic gastrectomy and lymph node dissection (D1 + Î²) was successfully performed in March 2009, and the patient was discharged on the 5th post-operative day without complications. This suggests that laparoscopic surgery is one of the feasible methods for resection of gastric cancer in liver transplant patients.
