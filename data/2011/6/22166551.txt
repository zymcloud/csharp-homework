Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in 80% of patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. Spontaneous rupture of HCC is a life-threatening complication observed in 3-15% of cases. Hemorrhagic shock after a sudden episode of abdominal pain is a typical symptom of the above-mentioned complication. The abdominal ultrasound and CT examinations show the presence of peritoneal cavity fluid and hepatic tumor. The Authors presented a case of a 66-year old female patient subject to emergency hemihepatectomy, due to spontaneous rupture of a 9 cm right hepatic lobe tumor.
