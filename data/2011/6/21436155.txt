Objectives:Some semi-synthetic derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics have been shown to exert in vitro antiviral activity against HIV and coronaviruses. Here we report and characterize the in vitro anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity of several semi-synthetic derivatives of teicoplanin aglycone.Methods:Anti-HCV activity was analysed in: (i) three different subgenomic HCV replicon systems using a luciferase or quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay; and (ii) an infectious HCV cell culture system by means of qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence assays.Results:Several teicoplanin aglycone derivatives elicited selective anti-HCV activity in replicons as well as infectious cell culture systems, with LCTA-949 being the most potent derivative. LCTA-949 proved, in contrast to several directly acting antivirals for HCV, efficient in clearing cells of their replicons. When LCTA-949 was combined with HCV protease or polymerase inhibitors an overall additive effect was observed. Likewise, LCTA-949 was equipotent against wild-type replicons as well as against replicons resistant to polymerase and protease inhibitors. Following up to 4 months of selective pressure, no drug-resistant replicons were selected. When combined with the HCV NS3 protease inhibitor VX-950, LCTA-949 prevented the development of VX-950-resistant variants.Conclusions:Semi-synthetic derivatives of teicoplanin aglycone constitute a novel class of HCV replication inhibitors that are not cross-resistant with various HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors and in particular are potent in clearing hepatoma cells of their replicons. This class of molecules also provides a good tool to obtain novel insights into the replication cycle of HCV and into cellular factors/processes that are crucial for viral replication.
