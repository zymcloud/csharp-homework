Background:Outcome of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is influenced by their histological grade. Invasive biopsy of the lesions is the gold standard in this regard.Aims:We therefore analysed the diagnostic accuracy of contrast enhanced ultrasound for non-invasive grading of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma in liver cirrhosis.Methods:According to the tumour perfusion kinetics on contrast enhanced ultrasound two grading groups were prospectively defined: well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (US-G1) and higher grade hepatocellular carcinoma (US-G2/G3). Immediately after contrast enhanced ultrasound-grading, biopsies of hepatocellular carcinoma-lesions (n=95, 1.2-12.5 cm) were obtained and analysed for tumour grading (G). Descriptive statistics, sensitivity, specificity positive and negative predictive values, diagnostic likelihood ratios and interoperator reproducibility were calculated (Îº).Results:Histologically 77 (81.1%) patients had G2-G3 and 18 (18.9%) had G1 tumours. Higher grade hepatocellular carcinoma showed more often a washout in the portal or late phase (pConclusions:Contrast enhanced ultrasound has a high diagnostic value and reproducibility for non-invasive grading of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma >1cm in patients with liver cirrhosis.
