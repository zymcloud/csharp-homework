To find out potent paclitaxel (PTX) formulations for cancer chemotherapy, we formulated PTX in O/W emulsion and liposome selected as candidates of nanocarriers for PTX. Surface modification of these nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) improved their in vivo behavior, but the effect of PEGylation on the pharmacokinetics of emulsion was not so remarkable and the release of PTX from emulsion was found to be very fast in blood circulation, indicating that emulsion would not be an adequate formulation for PTX. On the other hand, AUC of PEG liposome was 3.6 times higher than that of naked liposome after intravenous injection into normal rats due to the lower disposition into the reticuloendothelial system tissues such as liver and spleen. Since PEG liposome was able to stably encapsulate PTX in blood, AUC of PTX was also extensively enhanced after intravenous dosing of PTX-PEG liposome into normal rats. In the in vivo studies utilizing Colon-26 solid tumor-bearing mice, it was confirmed that PTX-PEG liposome delivered significantly larger amount of PTX to tumor tissue and provided more excellent anti-tumor effect than PTX-naked liposome. These results suggest that PEG liposome would serve as a potent PTX delivery vehicle for the future cancer chemotherapy.
