Few studies have addressed the relationship between starting hemoglobin (Hb) value and early phase prognosis after liver transplantation (OLT). The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between the starting Hb value and the early phase prognosis after OLT by retrospectively reviewing the medical records of 102 consecutive recipients. Within this cohort, 47 patients had pulmonary complications after OLT, including eight cases of pulmonary edema, 12 cases of acute lung injury, six cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 21 cases of pneumonia. According to whether the patients had pulmonary complications or not, they were categorized into the "no" versus the pulmonary complication groups. Twenty-two perioperative variables were analyzed in both groups to screen for variables that affected early pulmonary complications. A starting Hb ≤ 100 g/L was an independent risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. The duration to initial passage of flatus and the intensive care unit length of stay were significantly prolonged in patients with starting Hb values ≤ 100 g/L; these patients had poorer arterial blood gas analyses. The starting Hb value predicted the early phase prognosis after OLT for cirrhosis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.
