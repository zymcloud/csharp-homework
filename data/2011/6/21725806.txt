Three new ent-abietanoids, named xerophilusins XIV-XVI, and four known analogues, as well as four known chemical constituents were isolated from the leaves of Isodon xerophilus. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic studies, and comparison with literature data. In addition, the cytotoxic activity of the ent-abietanoids against chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562), stomach adenocarcinoma (MKN45), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) human cell lines was investigated and no activities were observed.
