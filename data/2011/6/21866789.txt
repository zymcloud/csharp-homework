The case of a 60-year-old woman with history of cryptogenic hepatic cirrhosis and a probable hepatic tumor, who died of upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to esophageal varices, is presented. An autopsy study was carried out, which showed a hepatocellular carcinoma and a left atrial cardiac myxoma with glandular elements. A review of the literature, searching for the association between these two tumors, in addition to other tumors, is presented.
