The study presents preliminary, retrospective experience with bland embolization for hepatic adenomas (HAs) with the use of tris-acryl gelatin microspheres. Eight patients underwent bland embolization for biopsy-proven HAs. A biopsy specimen was taken from only one lesion when multiple lesions were present. Seventeen embolizations were performed for abdominal pain, active bleeding, or prophylaxis against bleeding. Five patients underwent multiple procedures. Technical success rate was 100%. Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 10-40 mo). No growth was observed at follow-up in any treated lesion, and many lesions (13 of 16) regressed. Bland embolization may be safely used for treatment of abdominal pain and bleeding from HAs.
