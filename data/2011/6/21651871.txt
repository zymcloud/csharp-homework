Aim:To investigate the in vitro inhibitory effects of DC(dendritic cell)-CIK (cytokine-induced killer cell) cocultured cells combined with sorafenib against hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL27402.Methods:DC and CIK cells were generated in vitro by stimulating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with different cytokines, and then they were cocultured. The cytotoxicity of DC-CIK cocultured cells (DC-CIK) combined with sorafenib against BEL-7402 cells was determined by CCK8 kit. The apoptosis of BEL27402 cells was measured by Annexin V-FITC Kit.Results:The cytotoxicity rate of BEL27402 cells in DC-CIK +sorafenib group was significantly higher than those in the other there groups, with cytotoxicity rate in DC-CIK + sorafenib group being (72.24 Â± 2.42)% , which was 1.8 times that in DC-CIK group, 2.1 times that in sorafenib group , and 1.6 times that in CIK group(P Conclusion:DC-CIK cocultured cells combined with sorafenib can inhibit the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7402 in vitro. Molecular targeting therapy combined with immunotherapy may be a new way for the comprehensive treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
