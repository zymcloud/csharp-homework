A 59-year-old man with metastatic an esophageal tumor from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presented with progressive dysphagia. He had undergone liver transplantation for HCC three and a half years prevously. At presentation, his radiological and endoscopic examinations suggested a submucosal tumor in the lower esophagus, causing a luminal stricture. We performed complete resection of the esophageal metastases and esophagogastrostomy reconstruction using the da Vinci robotic system. Recovery was uneventful and he was been doing well 2 mo after surgery. Î±-fetoprotein level decreased from 510 ng/mL to 30 ng/mL postoperatively. During the follow-up period, he developed a recurrent esophageal stricture at the anastomosis site and this was successfully treated by endoscopic esophageal dilatation.
