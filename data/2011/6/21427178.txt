Objectives:To investigate whether radiofrequency (RF) ablation with low power (LP) or maximal power (MP) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can achieve optimal ablation and fewer adverse effects.Methods:RF ablation was performed with MP in 101 patients (129 tumours) and with LP in 46 patients (61 tumours). MP RF ablation used power of >120 W. RF power below this was designated as LP. Clinical outcomes were also analysed in subgroups of high-risk tumours near the bile duct and blood vessels.Results:Primary effectiveness was achieved in 91.8% in the LP group and 89.9% in the MP group (p = 0.795). 1 and 2-year local tumour progression rates were 28% and 30%, respectively, in the LP group, and 24% and 29%, respectively, in the MP group (p = 0.70). 1 and 2-year survival rates were 98% and 98%, respectively, in the LP group, and 93% and 90%, respectively, in the MP group (p = 0.216). The MP group had more adverse effects, with post-RF ablation syndrome, asymptomatic pleural effusion and ascites, than the LP group (20% vs 39% in the MP group; p = 0.027); however, there was no significant difference in major complication rates (6% in the MP and LP groups; p = 0.497). Among the patients with high-risk tumours, RF ablation using MP vs LP was comparable in primary effectiveness (91.7% vs 95.2%; p = 0.618), local tumour progression (42.9% vs 29.2%; p = 0.304) and overall complications (5% vs 8%; p=0.618).Conclusion:RF ablation with LP and MP are comparable in clinical outcomes but considerably fewer adverse effects were encountered in the LP group.
