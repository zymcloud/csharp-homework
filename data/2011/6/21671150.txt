Purpose:To evaluate technique effectiveness, safety, and interoperator performance of stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) of liver lesions.Methods:Retrospective review including 90 consecutive patients from January 2008 to January 2010 with 106 computed tomography-guided SRFA sessions using both single and multiple electrodes for the treatment of 177 lesions: 72 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 105 metastases with a mean size of 2.9 cm (range 0.5-11 cm). Technique effectiveness and 1-year local recurrence were evaluated by computed tomographic scans. Complications, mortality, and hospital days were recorded. The performance between an experienced and inexperienced interventional radiologist was compared.Results:The overall technique effectiveness after a single SRFA was 95.5% (93.1% for HCC and 97.1% for metastases). Four of the eight unsuccessfully treated lesions could be retreated (secondary technique effectiveness of 97.7%). Local recurrence at 1 year was 2.9%. Technique effectiveness was significantly different for lesions5 cm (87.5%) (P=0.044) but not for lesionsConclusion:SRFA allowed for efficient, reliable, and safe ablation of large-volume liver disease.
