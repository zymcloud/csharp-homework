Purpose:To lower the rate of cutaneous complications after transcatheter arterial treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the internal mammary artery (IMA) we retrospectively assessed the complications.Materials and methods:We reviewed cutaneous complications in 14 patients with 18 HCCs who had undergone 17 treatment procedures via the IMA, including selective transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy with Lipiodol (Lip-TAI) (n = 3), selective Lip-TAI + transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) (n = 3), nonselective Lip-TAI (n = 1), nonselective Lip-TAI + TAE (n = 5), and nonselective TAE (n = 5). The filling and nonfilling of subcutaneous vessels with Lipiodol was examined on postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans.Results:Skin rash (n = 3) and ulceration (n = 1) occurred after 4 of 17 (24%) procedures: two of three selective Lip-TAI procedures and two of five nonselective Lip-TAI + TAE procedures. The doses of chemotherapeutic agents for tumor sizes in selective Lip-TAI procedures were higher than those in selective Lip-TAI + TAE procedures. Cutaneous complications were encountered after two of three procedures with filling but not after any of eight procedures without filling.Conclusion:A lower dose of chemotherapeutic agents may be less risky when undertaking a selective procedure via the IMA for HCC. If nonselective, TAE alone may be less risky. Postoperative CT may be helpful for predicting cutaneous complications.
