Purpose:To describe the patterns of recurrence and serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation.Materials and methods:All cases of recurrent HCC after transplantation between September 2002 and August 2009 that underwent MRI including precontrast T1, T2-weighted images, and postgadolinium dynamic images were reviewed. On MRI we evaluated the characteristics and patterns of recurrent HCC after transplantation.Results:A total 7 of 76 transplanted patients (four men, three women, age range, 45-63, mean 52.7 years) were included in this study. Four patients (57.1%) were identified to have a pattern of persistent local disease (PLD) near the transplanted liver, hepatorenal space, or suture site within 2.75 years (range, 2-4 years). Two patients showed recurrent HCC in the allograft alone within 5 years. One patient showed an intraperitoneal seeding (IPS) pattern which demonstrated diffuse peritoneal infiltration and thickening within 9 months. The diffuse metastatic disease (DMD) pattern was observed as a late manifestation of PLD and IPS. The most prominent volume of recurrent tumor burden was found in an extrahepatic (5 of 7 patients) compared to an intrahepatic (2 of 7 patients) location. The signal intensities and enhancement patterns did not exhibit change with disease progression.Conclusion:We describe four patterns of recurrence of HCC following transplant. The most prominent tumor burden was located in an extrahepatic compared to an intrahepatic location.
