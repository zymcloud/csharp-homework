The liver is an important target for interleukin-6 (IL-6) action leading to an increased inflammatory response with impaired insulin signaling and action. The aims of this study are to address if insulin is anti-inflammatory and attenuates IL-6-induced inflammation in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and if this involves signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signal transduction. It was found that insulin significantly reduced IL-6-induced gene transcription of serum amyloid 1 (SAA1), serum amyloid 2 (SAA2), haptoglobin, orosomucoid, and plasmin activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). However, the authors did not find any evidence that insulin inhibited IL-6 signal transduction, i.e., no effect of insulin was detected on STAT3 phosphorylation or its translocation to cell nucleus. The potential role of PKCÎ´ was also analyzed but no evidence of its involvement was found. Taken together, these results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of insulin on IL-6 action is exerted at the level of the transcriptional activation of the genes. Further analysis revealed that insulin regulates nuclear localization of FOXO1, which is an important co-activator for STAT3 mediated transcription. Insulin induced nuclear exit and Thr24 phosphorylation of FOXO1, thus, inhibiting STAT3-mediated transcription.
