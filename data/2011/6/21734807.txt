Aim:To study the safety and feasibility of total embolization of the main splenic artery as a supplemental treatment modality for hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia or leukocytopenia accompanying liver cirrhosis.Methods:Fifteen consecutive patients with hypersplenism due to cirrhosis were enrolled in this study from January 2006 to June 2010. All patients underwent total embolization of the main splenic artery. Clinical symptoms, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts, splenic volume, and complications of the patients were recorded. The patients were followed up for 1 and 6 mo, and 1, 2, 3 years, respectively, after operation.Results:Total embolization of the main splenic artery was technically successful in all patients. Minor complications occurred in 13 patients after the procedure, but no major complications were found. The WBC and PLT counts were significantly higher and the residual splenic volume was significantly lower 1 and 6 mo, and 1, 2, 3 years after the procedure than before the procedure (P < 0.01). Moreover, the residual splenic volume increased very slowly with the time after embolization. All patients were alive during the follow-up period.Conclusion:Total embolization of the main splenic artery is a safe and feasible procedure and may serve as a supplemental treatment modality for hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia or leukocytopenia accompanying liver cirrhosis.
