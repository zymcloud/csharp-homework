Background:The plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer. The 4G/5G promoter polymorphism of PAI-1 is potentially involved in regulating gene transcription.Aims:To explore the role of the PAI-1 4G/5G repeat as target of microsatellite instability (MSI), 50 gastric carcinomas (GCs), characterized for MSI, were screened.Methods:PAI-1 4G/5G was analysed by direct sequencing.Results:Allelic imbalance was observed in 5 of the 50 (10%) GCs. Specifically, 2 cases (40%) harboured a G deletion and 3 (60%) a G insertion in tumour compared to normal DNA. These five cases were included in the subgroup of 20 GCs (25%) with high level of MSI (MSI-H). A statistically significant association emerged between PAI-1 mutations and MSI-H status (p=0.0073). The frequency of PAI-1 mutations was also evaluated, together with other known target genes, by analysing MSI-H GCs for mutations at selected coding repeats within genes controlling cell growth, apoptosis and DNA repair. Overall, mutation frequency ranged from 56.3% to 5.3%.Conclusion:The frequency of PAI-1 mutations here reported in MSI-H GCs is, accordingly, comparable with values obtained for real targets. The relatively high incidence of PAI-1 mutations is suggestive of a positive pressure towards selection in MSI-H GCs.
