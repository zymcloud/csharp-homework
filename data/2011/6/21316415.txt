In 1998, the National Toxicology Program concluded that inhalation exposure to tetrahydrofuran resulted in increased incidences of renal adenomas and carcinomas (combined) in male F344 rats and of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas (combined) in female B6C3F1 mice. In the present paper, the bioassay results and additional information are evaluated using the IPCS/ILSI Mode of Action/Human Relevance Framework to determine if the data are sufficient to describe the possible mode(s) of action (MOA) underlying the reported results for the rat renal tumor and to determine if any of these modes of action could be operative in humans. Preliminary analysis of the rat renal tumor data and related information suggested that a MOA could be described, but questions remained concerning the role that chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) may play in the development of the lesions. In 2009, a Pathology Working Group concluded that the rat renal lesions resulted primarily from regenerative processes associated with advanced CPN. The renal tumor finding is considered not relevant to humans and should not be considered in any further risk assessment efforts on this chemical. A companion paper describes a similar analysis of the female mouse liver tumor finding.
