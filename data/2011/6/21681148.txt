Gekko swinhonis Guenther has been used as an anti-cancer drug in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years. Previous studies showed that the Gekko sulfated polysaccharide-protein complex suppressed the proliferation and migration of hepatoma cells. Gekko sulfated glycopeptide α was obtained from Gekko sulfated polysaccharide-protein complex using papain hydrolysis. Gekko sulfated glycopeptide α inhibited the proliferation and migration of SMMC-7721 cells. The secretion of IL-8 and the concentration of intracellular calcium were decreased after Gekko sulfated glycopeptide α exposure. SMMC-7721 cells in the control group showed abnormal features, with a polygonal shape, whereas this changed to a spindle shape after the treatment with Gekko sulfated glycopeptide α. Actin ﬁlaments were distributed diffusely along the cell membrane in control cells, whereas those were polymerized and preferentially accumulated in the cytoplasm of treated cells. Microtubules distributed in the cytoplasm of untreated cells were located diffusely whereas those in treated cells were polymerized. Therefore, Gekko sulfated glycopeptide α inhibit the migration of hepatoma cells via reducing the secretion of IL-8 and the concentration of intracellular calcium, as well as regulating the reorganization of cytoskeleton.
