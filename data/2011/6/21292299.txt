The insulinlike growth factor signaling axis (factors I and II and their receptor) has been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Previous studies on insulinlike growth factor I receptor using resected hepatocellular carcinoma generated mixed results; however, the distribution and clinical significance of insulinlike growth factor I receptor β expression in hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of liver transplantation have not been evaluated. Immunohistochemical staining for insulinlike growth factor I receptor β was performed in 72 liver explants from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing liver transplantation. Expression of insulinlike growth factor I receptor β in hepatocytes was noted in 59.7% of tumors but only 6.9% of adjacent, nontumorous liver tissues (P
