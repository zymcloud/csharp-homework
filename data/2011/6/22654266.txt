Transarterial chemoembolization has proven benefit in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Commonly reported symptoms following chemoembolization with or without drug-eluting beads include abdominal pain, nausea, and low-grade fever, which typically limited resolve within a few days. A recent study comparing traditional chemoembolization versus chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads demonstrated similar survival between the two techniques, but improved tolerability when the drug-eluting beads were used. This case report describes a patient with unresectable HCC undergoing chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads. The postprocedure course was complicated by interstitial pneumonitis secondary to shunting of the drug-eluting beads containing doxorubicin to both lungs via tumor vasculature. This case highlights the relationship between the number and size of the tumors to be treated, arteriovenous shunting within the liver/tumors, and the size of the embolization particles.
