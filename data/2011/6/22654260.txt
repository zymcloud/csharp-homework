Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has become an important tool in the armamentarium of interventional oncology, particularly in the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic tumors. This procedure has proven to be an effective adjunct in treating hepatic tumors as a bridge to liver transplantation, and has a low complication profile. Although adverse events are rare and usually minor, a notable negative outcome is dissemination and implantation of viable tumor cells into the route of applicator entry, or tract seeding. Counter to the goal of treating a patient's cancer, this results in metastatic disease. In this report, the authors present 2 cases of tract seeding after RFA, methods of detection, and means of reducing the incidence of this relatively rare, but significant, complication.
Percutaneous ablation; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); radiofrequency ablation (RFA); tract seeding.
