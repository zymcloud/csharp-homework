Background/aim:Elevated relative expression of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) was observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) liver tissues with a role in neovascularization and associated with poor prognosis. IGF-II is influenced by the proteolytic cleavage of IGF-binding protein 3 and by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), which are further regulated by their tissue inhibitors tissue inhibitor of metalloprotienase-1 (TIMP-1). Our aim is to study new molecular markers for HCC.Patients/methods:RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood for evaluating the relative expression of IGF-II, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 in correlation with clinical staging of 39 HCC patients and 15 healthy controls using TaqMan real-time PCR.Results:The relative expression of IGF-II and MMP-9 mRNA were significantly elevated in HCC patients compared with healthy controls; P-value Conclusion:These results highlight the importance of profiling the expression of IGF-II, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 in the peripheral blood as prognostic molecular biomarkers in HCC.
