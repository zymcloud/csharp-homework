The dichloromethane extract from the leaves of Calotropis gigantea Linn. was strongly cytotoxic against non-small cell lung carcinoma (A549), colon carcinoma (HCT 116) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2), and non toxic to Chinese hamster ovary (AA8). The extract afforded uscharin (1), 3,5,8-trihydroxy-24-methylcholest-6,22-diene (2), a mixture of (24R)-3beta-hydroxy-24-ethylcholest-5-en-7-one (3a) and 6beta-hydroxy-24-ethylcholest-4,22-dien-3-one (3b), and another mixture of (24R)-24-ethylcholest-4-en-3-one (4a) and (24S)-24-ethylcholest-4,22-dien-3-one (4b). Cardenolide 1 exhibited extreme toxicity to A549, HCT 116 and Hep G2 with IC50 values of 0.003 microg/mL, 0.013 microg/mL, and 0.018 microg/mL, respectively, while sample 3 exhibited an IC50 of 1.35 microg/mL, 4.46 microg/mL, and 3.83 microg/mL, respectively.
