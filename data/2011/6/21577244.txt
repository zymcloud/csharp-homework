Objectives:Smokers are at risk for pancreatic cancer (PC) and other pancreatic diseases. Cigarette smoking also aggravates the risk of PC in patients with hereditary and chronic pancreatitis (CP) and results in a higher incidence of acute pancreatitis and relapses in CP. Both PC and CP are characterized by a progressive fibrosis. Recently, two studies on rats reported that tobacco smoking is associated with chronic pancreatic inflammation with fibrosis and scarring of pancreatic acinar structures. In this study, we aimed to confirm a relationship between cigarette smoking and pancreatic fibrosis (PF) in humans.Methods:In this retrospective study, pancreatic and liver tissue acquired during autopsy was collected and analyzed. PF was scored by assessing severity of intralobular, extralobular, and total PF: grade 0 (normal or mild; 0-25% PF), grade 1 (moderate; 25-50% PF), and grade 2 (severe; >50%). Information on smoking habits was extracted from (electronic) medical records.Results:Of 900 autopsies performed from January 2005 to December 2007, a minority of patients (n=111) met all inclusion criteria for analysis. Grade 2-3 total PF and intralobular PF was significantly more present in smokers vs. "never-smokers" (total: 42.9 vs. 26.5%, P=0.027 and intralobular: 39.3 vs. 15.6%, P=0.013), whereas no differences could be found between never-smokers and ex-smokers and between ex-smokers and smokers. When we took into account interlobular PF, no differences between all groups were observed. No relationship between PF and age (P=0.893), body mass index (P=0.707), and pancreatic lipomatosis (P=0.916) was observed.Conclusions:To our knowledge, no study in humans had studied the effect of tobacco smoking on pancreatic tissue. We have demonstrated for the first time that current cigarette smoking is associated with total PF-specifically, intralobular PF-as compared with nonsmokers.
