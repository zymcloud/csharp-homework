Objective:To assess and compare the predictive values of the hepatic Glasgow Prognostic Score (hGPS) and Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score in patients undergoing surgery for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The hGPS was calculated as follows: patients with an elevated level of C-reactive protein (CRP) (>0.3 mg/dl) were allocated a hGPS of 1 or 2 depending on the absence or presence of hypoalbuminemia (Results:Three hundred patients were evaluated. The hGPS divided patients into three independent groups, and that a hGPS of 2 predicted a higher mortality rate (P Conclusions:The hGPS is able to divide patients undergoing surgery for primary HCC into three independent groups, and is considered to be an important factor predictive of postoperative mortality in such patients.
