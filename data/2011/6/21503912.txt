The aim of this study was to determine whether mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome are associated with the onset of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). For the longitudinal study, full-length HBV genomes were cloned and sequenced from four ACLF patients and compared with sequences from matching samples collected before ACLF. For the cross-sectional study, 166 serum samples were obtained, including 49 samples from patients with ACLF. The results of longitudinal study showed that C53T, A1846T, and G1896A were the most common mutations in association with ACLF. In the cross-sectional study 61.2% patients with ACLF presented with T1846, which was higher than patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) (11.1%), liver cirrhosis (LC) (31.1%), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (33.3%). Prevalence of A/G1913 was 42.9% in patients with ACLF, also higher than patients with CHB (2.2%), LC (17.8%), and HCC (11.1%). There were no differences in HBV genotype and patients' HBeAg status among patients with ACLF, LC, and HCC. However, prevalence of T1846 was much higher in patients infected with genotype B (57.1%) than genotype C (30.4%). A/G1913 was higher in HBeAg negative patients (28%) than HBeAg positive patients (13.2%). Results of a multivariable analysis showed that T1846 and A/G1913 were independent factors for ACLF (OR = 3.373 and 4.244, respectively). Interestingly, T1846 destroys an ATG codon of a small open reading frame in the preC region, which may increase core protein expression. We conclude that T1846 and A/G1913 in the preC/C gene are closely associated with ACLF.
