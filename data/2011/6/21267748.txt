Background:Hepatic steatosis may develop after pancreatic resection, but its clinicopathological features remain unclear. We explored the clinical characteristics of newly appearing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), designated as de novo NAFLD after PD.Methods:Of 83 patients who underwent PD between 2001 and 2006, the patients with regular alcohol consumption after PD (n = 3), those who were unavailable for regular abdominal computed tomography follow-up (n = 12), and those who died within 6 months of PD (n = 8) were excluded from the study. In the remaining 60 patients, the prevalence and clinical features of de novo NAFLD after PD were examined.Results:NAFLD developed after PD in 14 (23%) patients in our cohort. Liver biopsy was performed in 8 patients and all showed typical steatohepatitis. Compared with the patients who had conventional nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), patients with post-PD de novo NASH demonstrated significant decreases in body mass index and lower levels of serum albumin, cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that pancreatic head cancer was associated with an increased risk of developing NAFLD after PD (odds ratio 12.0, 95% confidence interval 2.0-71.4, P = 0.006). Increased dosage of oral pancreatic enzymes significantly ameliorated the steatosis, as well as leading to the recovery of body weight loss and resolution of the biochemical abnormalities.Conclusions:De novo NAFLD/NASH after PD is characterized by non-obesity and lack of hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance and is associated with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. In such patients, intensifying pancreatic enzyme supplementation may be useful.
