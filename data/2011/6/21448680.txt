Diabetes and cancer are diseases which take the size of an epidemic spread across the globe. Those diseases are influenced by many factors, both genetic and environmental. Precise knowledge of the complex relationships and interactions between these two conditions is of great importance for their prevention and treatment. Many epidemiological studies have shown that certain types of cancer, especially gastrointestinal cancers (pancreas, liver, colon) and also the urinary and reproductive system cancers in women are more common in patients with diabetes or related metabolic disorders. There are also studies showing the inverse relationship between diabetes and cancer, or the lack of it, but they are less numerous and relate mainly to prostate cancer or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Epidemiological studies, however, do not say anything about the mechanisms of these dependencies. For this purpose, molecular research is needed on the metabolism of cells (including tumor cells) and on metabolic dysfunctions that arise due to changes in the cell environment taking place in the sick, as well as in the intensely treated human organism.
