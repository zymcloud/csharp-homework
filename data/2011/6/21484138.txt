Purpose:To establish a method of assessing the malignant potential of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods:For 69 nodules [12 Edmondson (Ed)-I, 48 Ed-II, 9 Ed-III] in 54 HCC patients, signal intensity patterns and enhancement patterns of gadopentate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) dynamic studies were correlated with histological differentiation and serum lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) level, which is an indicator of poor prognosis.Results:Hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging was seen in 17, 72, and 89% of Ed-I, Ed-II, and Ed-III HCCs, respectively (P Conclusions:Although hyperintensity of tumor on T2-weighted imaging and arterial hypervascularity of tumor are considered to be useful for differential diagnosis between well differentiated HCCs and moderately/poorly differentiated HCCs, hypointensity of tumor on T1-weighted imaging and tumor stain washout during the portal phase of Gd-DTPA dynamic MRI reflected poorer histological differentiation of HCCs and correlated with AFP-L3 levels.
