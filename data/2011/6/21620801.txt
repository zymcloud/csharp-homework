Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes chronic liver diseases and is a global health problem. HuH-7 hepatoma-derived cells are widely used as the only cell-based HCV replication system for HCV research, including drug assays. Recently, using different hepatoma Li23-derived cells, we developed an HCV drug assay system (ORL8), in which the genome-length HCV RNA (O strain of genotype 1b) encoding renilla luciferase replicates efficiently. In this study, using the HuH-7-derived OR6 assay system that we developed previously and the ORL8 assay system, we evaluated 26 anti-HCV reagents, which other groups had reported as anti-HCV candidates using HuH-7-derived assay systems other than OR6. The results revealed that more than half of the reagents showed different anti-HCV activities from those in the previous studies, and that anti-HCV activities evaluated by the OR6 and ORL8 assays were also frequently different. In further evaluation using the HuH-7-derived AH1R assay system, which was developed using the AH1 strain of genotype 1b, several reagents showed different anti-HCV activities in comparison with those evaluated by the OR6 and ORL8 assays. These results suggest that the different activities of anti-HCV reagents are caused by the differences in cell lines or HCV strains used for the development of assay systems. Therefore, we conclude that plural HCV assay systems developed using different cell lines or HCV strains are required for the objective evaluation of anti-HCV reagents.
