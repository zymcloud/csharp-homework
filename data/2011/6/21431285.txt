The aim of this study was to detect the expression of the Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) protein in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to associate FOXM1 expression with clinicopathological features of the patients, and predict the prognosis of patients with FOXM1 expression. Surgical tissue specimens from 151 HCC patients were subjected to a tissue microarray construction and immunohistochemistry analysis of FOXM1 and the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The data showed that the FOXM1 protein was expressed in 59.3% of the HCC tissues, which was significantly higher compared to that of the surrounding non-tumorous tissues (23.8%; P
