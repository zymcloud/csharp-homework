Aim:To investigate the chemosensitivity small interfering RNA (siRNA) on liver cancer cell line SMMC7721.Methods:The siRNA sequences design based on signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene, siRNA were transfected into SMMC7721 cells through liposome lipofectamine(TM); 2000. The expression inhibition of STAT3 gene in SMMC7721 cells was measured by real-time relative quantitative PCR. The cells growth inhibition rate were measured by MTT colorimetry after 10 Î¼mol/L 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) action.Results:The siRNA expression vector to aim directly at STAT3 gene was constructed successfully. The result of real-time PCR revealed that specificity siRNA were transfected into SMMC7721 cells could inhibit the expression of STAT3 gene. STAT3 gene in SMMC7721 cells were specialty and effectually inhibit the expression by RNA interference (RNAi). MTT colorimetry detection result revealed that SMMC7721 cells inhibition rate significantly increasing after siRNA action.Conclusion:The siRNA expression vector can active inhibit expression of STAT3 gene in SMMC7721 cells, enhance its sensitivity to chemotherapeutics 5-Fu, to provide experiment based on for the biological therapy of tumor.
