Background:We wished to determine whether pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) therapy after curative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevents a recurrence of HCC.Methods:Thirty-seven HCC patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who were treated with PEG-IFN after curative treatment (PEG-IFN group) and 145 controls without IFN therapy (non-IFN group) were enrolled. The overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates were compared between the groups, and the predisposing factors for recurrence and survival were analyzed. The rates were also examined by propensity score (PS) matched analysis that could minimize selection biases.Results:The median follow-up period was 3.7 years. The 5-year survival rate in the PEG-IFN group (91%) was significantly higher than that in the non-IFN group (56%; P Conclusion:PEG-IFN-therapy after curative treatment of HCC improved the rate of survival, and SVR was found to be closely correlated with the prevention of recurrence.
