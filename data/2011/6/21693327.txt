Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) commonly develops in cirrhotic or noncirrhotic livers affected by congenital hemochromatosis. In patients with congenital hemochromatosis and HCC, liver transplantation is a therapeutic option with a 5-year posttransplantation survival rate as high as 80%. Herein is reported congenital hemochromatosis in a 37-year-old man. During a routine checkup, 2 liver nodules were detected. Signal characteristics at magnetic resonance imaging indicated the presence of iron-free foci (IFF). The serum Î±-fetoprotein concentration was within the range of normal, and repeated liver biopsy did not show histomorphologic signs of malignancy but confirmed the presence of IFF in surrounding siderosis. The patient was listed for liver transplantation with match MELD (Model of End-Stage Liver Disease including exceptions) because of suspected HCC. After 173 days on the waiting list, liver transplantation was performed successfully. Histologic examination of the explanted liver confirmed 2 HCC lesions with a diameter of 0.9 cm in the exact projection as the IFF detected at magnetic resonance imaging. At 20 months of rapamycin-based immunosuppression therapy, there were no signs of HCC recurrence. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of liver transplantation performed to treat suspected HCC based on the finding of IFF in congenital hemochromatosis, with histopathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of HCC after transplantation. According to this case and the current literature, IFF in patients with congenital hemochromatosis should be considered preneoplastic lesions vulnerable to possible development of HCC.
