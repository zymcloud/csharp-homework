Introduction:Right lobe donor hepatectomy (RLDH) is a potential source of liver allografts given the ongoing shortage of deceased donor organs available. Since there is no live donor registry in the United States, a population-based, unsolicited state-wide analysis has yet to be reported.Methods:The New York (NY) State Inpatient Database was used to query 1,524 elective liver lobectomies performed from 2001 to 2006. RLDH were identified in this cohort (n = 195; 13%). Most common indications for elective right lobe hepatectomy (ERH) were metastatic colon cancer (50%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (34%). Primary outcomes were mortality, perioperative resources and major postoperative complications.Results:After a dramatic drop in 2002, there was a slow increase in RLDH from 2003 to 2006 in New York. Donors were younger (median age 36 vs. 60 years, P Conclusions:This study represents one of the first unsolicited regional analyses of donor morbidity and resource utilization for RLDH and further emphasizes the need and utility of a live donor registry.
