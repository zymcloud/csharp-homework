Objective:To evaluate clinical outcomes after laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) combined with intersphincteric resection (ISR) for ultra-low rectal tumors.Methods:Clinical data of 36 patients with ultra-low rectal tumor undergoing laparoscopic TME combined with ISR were analyzed retrospectively.Results:The median distance from the inferior margin of the tumor to the anal verge was 3.4 (2.0-5.0) cm. There were 33 cases of well/moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and 3 rectal malignant villous adenoma. There were 16 patients with stage I disease, 15 with stage II A, 3 with stage III A, and 1 with III B. Postoperatively, one patient developed stenosis at the end ileostomy and 3 anastomotic leakage. After a median follow-up of 16(4-49) months, one patient developed local recurrence at the anastomosis and one case died of liver metastasis. In the 19 patients who had a minimum follow-up of one year, the bowel movements frequency ranged from 1-4 times per day, and these patients were able to withhold defecation for more than 5 minutes.Conclusions:Laparoscopic TME combined with ISR can achieve oncologic clearance, sphincter preservation, and minimal invasiveness for ultra-lower rectal cancer. However, patients selection should be cautious.
