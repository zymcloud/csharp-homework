Background:The recent use of single-port-access surgery in cholecystectomy and other abdominal surgeries has confirmed its safety and validity as a treatment option. However, few reports have described the use of complete single-port access surgeries in hepatectomy for neoplasms.Methods:The authors performed single-port laparoscopic hepatectomy (SLH) for eight patients (5 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 patient with metastatic liver tumor, 1 patient with endocrine liver tumor, and 1 patient with hemangioma). Furthermore, in terms of Child-Pugh classification, five patients were in category A, two in category B, and one in category C. The patients were eligible for SLH if they had solitary tumors measuring 3 cm or smaller on the caudal surface of the liver. The lesion was approached through a 20-mm supraumbilical incision using a single-port access device.Results:No patient experienced intraoperative complications that required additional port access and conversion to laparotomy. The operative time was 148 min (range, 141-235 min). The postoperative course of the patients was uneventful, and they were discharged an average of 6.2 days (range, 3-11 days) after the operation. Approximately 2 weeks after discharge, the patients experienced no wound pain or liver dysfunction.Conclusion:The SLH technique is a safe and feasible procedure for a specific group of candidates, including patients with high-grade liver dysfunction.
