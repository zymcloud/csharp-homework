The existence of statistical associations between hepatitis B-related acute-on-chronic liver failure and both hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype and mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP) and precore (PC) regions needs to be confirmed. A total of 322 patients with a chronic HBV infection, including 77 with hepatitis B-related acute-on-chronic liver failure, 109 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 136 with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were enrolled. The HBV genotype and the presence of mutations in the BCP/PC regions were determined by direct sequencing, and the frequencies were compared in the three patient groups. Overall, 198/322 (61.5%) were infected with genotype B and 124/322 (38.5%) with genotype C. Genotype B was significantly more frequent in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure than CHB (92.2% vs. 60.3%, P
