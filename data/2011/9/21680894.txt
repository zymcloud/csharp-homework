Activation of the bifunctional kinase/RNase enzyme IRE1α is part of an adaptive response triggered on accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To facilitate recovery of ER homeostasis, IRE1α molecules oligomerize, allowing for their transautophosphorylation and endoribonuclease activation. These, in turn, induce the activation of specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional programs. To identify novel and selective modulators of IRE1α activity, we investigated IRE1α oligomerization properties using IRE1α-derived peptides identified through an activity-based in vitro assay. We then used these peptides to probe IRE1α activity in vitro and in vivo using both cultured human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived HuH7 cells and Caenorhabditis elegans experimental systems. We identified a peptide derived from the kinase domain of human IRE1α, which promoted IRE1α oligomerization in vitro, enhanced its Xbp1 mRNA cleavage activity in vitro (1.7×) in cell culture (1.8×) and in vivo (1.3×), and attenuated both ER stress-mediated JNK activation and regulated IRE1-dependent mRNA decay (RIDD). This was accompanied by a 2.5-fold increase in survival on tunicamycin-induced ER stress and reduced apoptosis by 1.4-fold in cells expressing this peptide. Hence, targeted and selective activation of the catalytic properties of IRE1α may consequently define new strategies to protect cells from deleterious effects of ER stress signaling.
