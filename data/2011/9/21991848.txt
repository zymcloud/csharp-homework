Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality in men and the fourth most common in women. The most frequent location of distant metastases are: the pleura, liver, suprarenal gland, brain, bones, pericardium and subcutaneous tissue. Others locations of distant metastases are very rare. This case report presents a 61-year-old female patient treated with Cisplatin and Vinorelbin therapy for posterior segment of eyeballs metastases secondary to NSCLS. Fluorescein angiography, computed tomography with contrast intensification and magnetic resonance were compared during the 3-month treatment period. After the 4-rd cycle of chemiotherapy (Cisplatin and Vinorelbin) one elevated choroidal mass on the posterior wall in the superiotemporal quadrant of the right eyeball and one mass in the lower-inside quadrant of the left eyeball had completely disappeared. The retina and a retinal pigment epithelial layer were flattened. Combining Cisplatin and Vinorelbin was optimal treatment for our patient with intraocular metastasis of NSCLC. The first clinical symptom of nonsmall cell lung cancer was blindness. The described case confirms, that distant metastases of non-small cell lung cancer also occur in atypical places at be a cause of great diagnostic problems and can delay start of anticancer treatment.
