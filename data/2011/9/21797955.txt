The outcome of HCC after transplantation (OLT) in children is not well known. Unfavorable features based on adult reports may lead to contraindicate OLT even in children. We reviewed a cohort of children with cirrhosis and HCC to evaluate their outcome after primary transplantation. We considered children with cirrhosis and HCC who had a primary OLT. We retrospectively recorded demographic, medical and surgical features, and MC as predictors of outcome. Among 456 children transplanted in the last 15 yr, 10 (2%), median age at diagnosis 1.8 yr (range 0.5-7.2), had HCC in biliary atresia (3), BSEP deficiency (3), tyrosinemia type 1 (2), complications of choledocal cyst and glycogen storage disease type IV (1 each). At HCC discovery, median AFP was 2322 ng/mL (3-35,000), high or rising in 9/10 patients. Six patients were outside the MC. Median time on the waiting list was 38 days (1-152). Two patients died from early complications of OLT. In the other eight patients, there was no tumor recurrence after a median follow-up of four yr. Children with cirrhosis may develop HCC at a very young age. The outcome appears excellent even outside MC. Primary liver transplantation is advisable for children with cirrhosis, HCC, and no extrahepatic disease.
