microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proven to play key regulatory roles in hepatocarcinogenesis. In the present study, the possible role of microRNA-450a (miR-450a) in hepatocarcinogenesis was investigated. Our study revealed that miR-450a was significantly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared with that in normal liver (NL) and para-tumorous (PT) tissues, and miR-450a expression in HepG2 cells was significantly lower than that in L02 cells. Both the mRNA and protein levels of the miR-450a potential target gene, DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a), were obviously higher in HCC compared with levels in the NL and PT tissues. We further identified DNMT3a as the direct target gene for miR-450a, and ectopic miR-450a expression in HepG2 cells caused the down-regulation of DNMT3a and an inhibition of cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-450a plays an important regulatory role in hepatocarcinogenesis through inhibition of DNMT3a expression, and miR-450a may be a potential target for the treatment of HCC.
