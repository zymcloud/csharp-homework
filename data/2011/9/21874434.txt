Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation is associated with a poor prognosis; nonetheless, we report two cases of long-term survival after resection of pulmonary metastatic lesions following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). The intervals between LDLT and pulmonary resection for the metastatic lesion were 24 months and 30 months, respectively. Regular checking of tumor markers and prompt workup for early detection may contribute to the resectability of such metastatic lesions. These cases suggest that resection of a solitary metastatic lesion in the lung from HCC after liver transplantation may be a feasible treatment for selected patients.
