There is a growing evidence that regucalcin (RGN) plays a multifunctional role in liver cancer cells. Previous reports showed that the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a significant increase in RGN mRNA expression and promoter activity in rat hepatoma cells. In this study, we confirmed that human RGN is also up-regulated by PMA treatment independent of translation, and we identified the mechanism by which PMA up-regulates the expression of human RGN via driving SP1 away from a SP1 motif located within -188/-180 of the promoter in HepG2 cells. Overexpression of SP1 dramatically reduces PMA-induced up-regulation of both internal expression of mRNA and promoter activity, whereas knockdown of SP1 has the opposite effect. Therefore, the present study delineates the fundamental elements in the promoter which will be helpful in the future studies on the regulation of RGN expression in liver cancer.
