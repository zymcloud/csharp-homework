Objective:To analyze the high risk factors for tumor recurrence in short term after hepatectomy for the patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Five hundreds and two patients with primary HCC underwent hepatectomy were included from January 1997 to December 2008. Among these patients, males were 419 cases and females were 83 cases. The age was 14 to 82 years (average age 54 years). The results of evaluation on 2 months after resection and tumor recurrence and survival were analyzed.Results:According to the operative and pathologic findings and the evaluation on 2 months after hepatectomy, the patients with vascular invasion, palliation resection, cutting edge pathologic residual tumor, lymph notes metastasis, serum AFP level continuing higher after resection or(and) positive TACE (tumor dyeing on TACE within 1 month and a deposit of lipiodol on CT scan) were high risk factors (high-risk group, 106 cases, 21.1%), the recurrence-free survival was 22%, 9% and 3% (1, 2 and 5 year) and overall survival was 52%, 25% and 8%. On the non-high risk group patients, the recurrence-free survival was 84%, 67%, 42% and 31% (1, 2, and 5 year) and overall survival was 97%, 85%, 56% and 35%. The bigger tumor, poor differentiation, tumor invading to liver capsule, satellite focus and TNM III-IV stage in high-risk groups were more significantly than that in non-high-risk groups.Conclusion:The vascular invasion, palliation resection, cutting edge pathologic residual tumor, lymph notes metastasis, serum AFP level continuing higher or (and) positive TACE within 2 months after resection are high risk factors for HCC patients in short term after hepatectomy, which mean tumor remnant.
