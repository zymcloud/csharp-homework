Objective:To establish a HPLC method for measuring tashinone II(A) concentration in rabbit plasma and study the pharmacokinetics of tashinone II(A) -loaded polylactic acid nanoparticles and tashinone II(A) injection in rabbits.Methods:A single dose of TS-PLA-NP and TS II(A) injection was administered to 8 healthy rabbits via the ear-edge vein, at the set time withdrew the blood and prepared. The concentrations of tashinone II(A) in plasma were measured by HPLC with gemfibrozil as the internal standard. The pharmacokinetic parameters of TS-PLA-NP and tashinone II(A) injection were calculated by program DAS2.0.Results:The average retention times of gemfibrozil and tashinone II(A) were 10.5 and 14.5 min, respectively. The half-life was prolonged from 2. 573 h of free tashinone II(A) to 4. 117 h and MRT(0-infinity) from 2.585 h to 6.033 h. The max concentration of tashinone II(A) was reduced from 0.21 to 0.134 mg/L.Conclusion:The method for the pharmacokinetic research of tshinone II A in rabbit plasma is accuracy, rapid and sensitive. TS-PLA-NP shows significant characteristic of delayed-release.
