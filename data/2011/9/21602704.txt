Background:Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is recommended in patients with cirrhosis, but earlier studies suggest that it is used less than one-third of the time. Patient factors associated with surveillance rates are incompletely understood.Goals:The aims of our study were to determine HCC surveillance rates in a tertiary-care center and to identify patient predictors of receiving surveillance.Study:Patients with Child A or B cirrhosis seen in the University of Michigan liver clinics between October 2008 and March 2009 were enrolled to complete a self-administered survey. Surveillance rates and clinical data were extracted from the patient electronic medical record.Results:Of the 160 patients enrolled, 74.4% had HCC surveillance performed in the past year. On multivariate analysis, predictors of receiving surveillance included male sex (odds ratio 7.1, 95% confidence interval, 1.2-43.2) and patient involvement in their care (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.5-7.9). Patients expressed high levels of concern regarding HCC, desired more information from their physicians, and wanted to be more involved in their care.Conclusions:HCC surveillance rates in a tertiary-care center were significantly higher than earlier reported rates. Direct patient involvement in decisions regarding HCC surveillance may help to improve surveillance rates.
