Objective:To analyze the prognostic factors in patients after surgical resection of a huge primary liver cancer (HPLC).Methods:Clinical and follow-up data of 69 cases of huge HPLC treated in our hospital from July 2001 to July 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. Sixteen clinicopathologic factors possibly influencing the survival were selected, and multivariate analysis of these parameters was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:The cumulative 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates of 58 patients were 58.2%, 31.4% and 12.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that radical resection, intrahepatic metastasis, vascular invasion and degree of hepatic cirrhosis significantly affect the postoperative survival. The Cox multivariate analysis indicated that radical resection, intrahepatic metastasis and degree of hepatic cirrhosis are independent prognostic factors.Conclusions:Surgical resection is a major and active treatment for huge HPLC. The therapeutic efficacy depends on intrahepatic metastasis, degree of hepatic cirrhosis and radical resection. Aggressive treatment and prevention on postoperative intrahepatic recurrence and metastasis is an important strategy to improve the survival of patients with huge HPLC.
