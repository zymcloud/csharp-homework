Purpose:There is no detailed analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 3 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Our aim was to define frequently deleted loci on chromosome 3 and to explore novel prognostic markers and the locations of candidate tumor suppressor genes associated with CRC.Methods:LOH at 23 microsatellite markers spanning on chromosome 3 was determined in 112 sporadic CRC by automated fluorescence-based polymerase chain reaction. Genetic loss was assessed for the clinicopathological significance by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:Fifty-eight (51.8%) of 112 carcinomas exhibited LOH at one or more loci tested. Among seven loci with high LOH rates, allelic losses at D3S1297 and D3S1266 occurred more frequently in younger patients. A marked gender distortion for genetic deletion was observed at six loci, where LOH was identified more frequently in male cases. For clinical outcome, LOH solely at D3S1297 (3p26.3) was significantly associated with distant metastasis (P = 0.001) and was indicative of a shorter overall survival (P = 0.014). In addition, loss of one common deletion region at 3p25-pter was significantly correlated to distant metastasis (P = 0.009) and had an adverse effect on patients' overall survival in univariate and multivariate tests (P = 0.009 and 0.001, respectively).Conclusions:Loss of chromosome 3p25-pter could act as an independent predicator of poor prognosis in CRC, suggesting that microsatellite analysis is a useful means to stratify patients into different risk groups. In addition, inactivation of candidate tumor suppressor genes in this region might involve in CRC progression.
