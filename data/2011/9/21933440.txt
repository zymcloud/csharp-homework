Background:The influence of viral hepatitis status on prognosis in patients undergoing hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a matter of debate. This study is a meta-analysis of the available evidence.Methods:A literature search was performed to identify comparative studies reporting postoperative survival of HCC in different types of viral hepatitis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and weighted mean differences (WMD with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using either the fixed effects model or random effects model.Results:Twenty studies matched the selection criteria and reported on 4744 subjects, of whom 2008 in the HBV-positive (B-HCC) group, 2222 in the HCV-positive (C-HCC) group, and 514 in the hepatitis B- and C-negative (NBNC-HCC). Meta-analysis showed that patients with HBV or HCV infection had a worse 5-year disease-free survival when compared to patients with NBNC-HCC (respectively: OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.53, P Conclusions:Patients with positive serology for hepatitis B or C undergoing resection for HCC had a poor prognosis compared to patients with negative serology.
