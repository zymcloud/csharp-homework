Multi drug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle in the chemotherapeutic treatment of many human cancers. 2',4'-Dihydroxy-6'-methoxy-3',5'-dimethylchalcone (DMC), a chalcone, isolated from the buds of Cleistocalyx operculatus, has been shown to have antitumor effects on human carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells in vitro and in vivo. In this paper, we studied the reversal effect and the mechanism of DMC on human hepatocellular carcinoma drug-resistant cells BEL-7402/5-FU in vitro. Administration of DMC reversed the multi-drug resistance of human hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402/5-FU cells significantly. DMC enhanced the sensitivity of BEL-7402/5-FU cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and doxorubicin (DOX). Staining with Hoechst 33258 and flow cytometric analysis showed that DMC has apoptosis-inducing effect on BEL-7402/5-FU cells. It could also increase the concentration of 5-FU in the resistant multi-drug-resistant cells. We also observed that over-expression of the multi-drug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) and of the glutathione S-transferase π (GST-π) contributed to MDR in BEL-7402/5-FU cells. The mRNA expressions of MRP1 and GST-π and the protein expression of MRP1 were decreased by DMC. These data demonstrated that DMC could effectively reverse MDR in BEL-7402/5-FU cells.
