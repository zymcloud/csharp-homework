Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt, also known as Abernethy malformation, is a rare malformation in which intestinal and splenic venous blood bypasses the liver and drains into systemic veins. Aside from the complete or near-complete absence of portal veins, other histologic features of Abernethy malformation have not been evaluated in the literature. The goal of this study was to detail the hepatic histopathology in 5 patients with Abernethy malformation diagnosed at our institution. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 1 explant, 2 liver tumor resections, and 2 liver biopsies were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin stains, reticulin, elastic, and trichrome stains, and immunohistochemistry for D2-40. Histologic findings included absence of portal veins in small portal tracts, absent or hypoplastic portal veins in medium-sized and large-sized portal tracts, isolated capillaries and arterioles in the lobules, hypertrophy of hepatic artery branches, remodeling of the liver architecture, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia in 1 case. Two patients had hepatocellular carcinoma without cirrhosis, and 2 had focal nodular hyperplasia. In addition to loss of portal veins, Abernethy malformation is characterized by multiple abnormalities due to remodeling of the hepatic vasculature. Abernethy malformation may also be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia in some patients.
