Hepatitis C virus infection is a common liver disease worldwide, leading to the development of steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection the prevalence of steatosis has been estimated to be about 55%. Development of steatosis is due to both viral and metabolic factors. Hepatitis C virus proteins moderate a number of intracellular pathways, however, further studies are required to understand these mechanisms. Obesity and insulin resistance may allow the virus to resist antiviral treatment. This review discusses the relationship among steatosis, insulin resistance and the response to antiviral therapy.
