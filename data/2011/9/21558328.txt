Inflammation is often accompanied by hypoxia. However, crosstalk between signalling pathways activated by inflammation and signalling events that control adaptive response to hypoxia is not fully understood. Here we show that exposure to tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activates expression of the inhibitory PAS domain protein (IPAS) to suppress the hypoxic response caused by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 and HIF-2 in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells but not in human hepatoma Hep3B cells. This induction of IPAS was dependent on the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and attenuated hypoxic induction of HIF-1 target genes such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). HIF-dependent reporter activity in hypoxia was also decreased following TNF-α treatment. Knockdown of IPAS mRNA by small interfering RNA (siRNA) restored the TNF-α-suppressed hypoxic response. These results indicate that TNF-α is a cell-type specific suppressor of HIFs and suggest a novel crosstalk between stimulation by inflammatory mediators and HIF-dependent hypoxic response.
