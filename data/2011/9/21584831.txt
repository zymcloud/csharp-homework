Background:Locoregional therapy has been advocated as an effective treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the majority of patients with HCC receive locoregional therapy prior to liver transplantation (LT). We herein aim to determine the prognostic factors affecting the outcome in patients who receive pretransplantation therapy.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study of the prospective data of patients who received locoregional therapy before undergoing LT for HCC. The clinicopathologic features of the patients were studied using univariate and multivariate analysis to determine prognostic factors.Results:Univariate and multivariate analysis of clinicopathologic features identified mean tumor necrosis (TN) ≥60% as the sole independent factor associated with lower HCC recurrence following LT. Further, the groups of patients with mean TN ≥60% who were within the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria and whose tumors beyond UCSF criteria were downstaged by TN following locoregional therapy had significantly better survival rates than the opposite groups. In-depth exploration of treatment modalities and pathological features indicated that HCC showed marked TN, while tumor nodules were well treated by locoregional therapy, and no viable tumors could be detected on radiological examination.Conclusions:Mean TN ≥60% of tumor by locoregional therapy could offer better outcomes for patients with HCC undergoing LT. Therefore, locoregional therapy should be considered for patients with HCC awaiting LT or potential candidates for LT in order to induce TN as well as leading to diminished viable tumor burden and reducing the odds of HCC recurrence following LT.
