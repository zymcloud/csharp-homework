Typhonium giganteum Engl. (BaiFuzi) is one of the herbs commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine against cancer. In our previous studies, 37 compounds were identified the SFE-CO(2) (supercritical fluid extraction with CO(2)) extract by GC-MS, including the four major components [Î²-sitosterol (40.22%), campesterol (18.45%), n-hexadecanoic acid (9.52%) and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid (8.15%)]. The anti-cancer mechanisms of the SFE-CO(2 )extract from T. giganteum Engl. tubers have not been reported as yet. In this paper, the molecular mechanisms of the SFE-CO(2) extract-mediated apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells were further examined. SFE-CO(2) extract inhibited the growth of SMMC-7721 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, arrested the cell cycle in the S phase and G2/M phase, and induced apoptosis. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, a rise in intracellular calcium levels were found in SMMC-7721 cells after treated with the extract. Western blot analysis showed that the extract caused down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, and up-regulation of Bax expression. Moreover, caspase-3 and caspase-9 protease activity significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our results showed that the SFE-CO(2) extract from T. giganteum Engl. tubers induces apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells involving a ROS-mediated mitochondrial signalling pathway.
