Antiviral prophylaxis has proved successful for prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients; though emerging data suggest that antiviral agents interfere with immunity, and may inhibit immune priming. In this context, we investigated levels and phenotype of primary CMV-specific immune responses that developed during antiviral prophylaxis in a cohort of CMV seronegative recipients (R(-) ) of a SOT from a seropositive donor (D(+) ). We longitudinally monitored CMV viral load, antibodies and levels of the negative immuno-modulator IL-10. PBMC were stimulated with CMV-specific peptide libraries to measure CD137 activation marker on CMV-specific T-cells and levels of PD-1 receptor, which is over expressed on exhausted T-cells. Unexpectedly, the majority (13/18) of D(+) R(-) patients who developed a primary CMV response showed early post-transplant CMV-specific responses, though levels of PD-1 on CMV-specific T-cells remained elevated throughout prophylaxis. A strong inverse association was found between levels of plasma IL-10 and CMV-specific cellular immune responses. Our study suggests that during prophylaxis, subclinical CMV infection might have occurred in the D(+) R(-) patients, and primary CMV-specific responses were detected early post-transplant when levels of plasma IL-10 were low. Extended prophylaxis or antiviral treatment did not appear to suppress CMV-specific antibodies or T-cells, which, however, showed exhaustion phenotypes.
