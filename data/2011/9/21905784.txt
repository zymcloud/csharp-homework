Multiple HCV genotypes have been isolated worldwide. Genotype seems to be involved in the main pathological aspects of HCV infection. Insulin resistance, steatosis and progression toward cirrhosis, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma establish and develop following genotype-specific mechanisms. Moreover genotype influences pharmacological treatment in term of dose and duration. Pathways involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, insulin and interferon signaling are impaired to a different extent among genotypes, leading to distinct pathological settings. Genotype 1 is associated with a more aggressive disease with increased insulin resistance, worst response to therapy, higher risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma development, while genotype 3 is associated with increased steatosis and fibrosis. The identification and characterization of HCV types and subtypes provides insight into the different outcome of HCV infection and responsiveness to therapy. In the present article, we focused on the pathogenicity of HCV genotypes and their effect on disease progression and treatment.
