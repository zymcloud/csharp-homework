Background and aim:The prognosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (CC-HCC) was reported to be poor because many of them were discovered at the advanced stage. The aim of this study is to reveal the clinical features of early CC-HCC.Methods:Consecutive 36 curatively treated CC-HCC patients satisfying the Milan Criteria were compared with corresponding 211 HCV-associated HCC (HCV-HCC) patients. The clinical background, tumor recurrence rate, overall survival rate, and prognostic values of the patients were assessed.Results:The size of CC-HCCs was larger than that of HCV-HCCs (P = 0.01). The respective tumor recurrence rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 11%, 32%, and 46% in the CC-HCC, and 21%, 59%, and 81% in the HCV-HCC. The respective overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 94%, 85%, and 80% in the CC-HCC, and 98%, 81%, and 61% in the HCV-HCC. CC-HCC patients had a lower tumor recurrence rate and a higher survival rate compared to the HCV-HCC patients (P = 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively). Via multivariate analysis, significant factors for high recurrence rate were number of HCCs (P = 0.02) and serum alpha fetoprotein levels (P = 0.03) in CC-HCC, whereas multiple tumors (P Conclusion:The size of CC-HCC was larger than that of HCV-HCC even in patients who received curative treatment; however, the risk for recurrence and the mortality of the patients with CC-HCC was lower than those with HCV-HCC.
