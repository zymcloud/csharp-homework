hsa-miR-191 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the factors regulating this elevated expression are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms of increased hsa-miR-191 expression by analyzing the relationship between the DNA methylation status of hsa-miR-191 and miR-191 expression. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), bisulfite sequencing PCR, Northern blot, and quantitative real-time PCR were performed to examine hsa-miR-191 methylation and expression levels. Western blot, transwell, and scratch assays were performed to examine the function and molecular mechanisms of hsa-miR-191. Approximately 58.9% of hsa-miR-191 expression was higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues; this high expression was associated with poor prognosis. The hypomethylation observed in some HCC cell lines and HCC tissues was correlated with the hsa-miR-191 expression level. This correlation was validated by treatment with the 5-aza-DAC demethylation agent. The level of hypomethylation was 63.0% in 73 clinical HCC tissue samples and was associated with increased (2.1-fold) hsa-miR-191 expression. The elevated expression of hsa-miR-191 in the SMMC-771 HCC cell line induced the cells to transition into mesenchymal-like cells; they exhibited characteristics such as loss of adhesion, down-regulation of epithelial cell markers, up-regulation of mesenchymal cell markers, and increased cell migration and invasion. Inhibiting hsa-miR-191 expression in the SMMC-7721 cell line reversed this process (as assessed by cell morphology and cell markers). Furthermore, hsa-miR-191 probably exerted its function by directly targeting TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 and inhibiting TIMP3 protein expression. Our results suggest that hsa-miR-191 locus hypomethylation causes an increase in hsa-miR-191 expression in HCC clinical tissues and that this expression induces HCC cells to transition into mesenchymal-like cells.
