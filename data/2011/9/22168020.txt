Experience of surgical treatment of 171 patients, suffering hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), was summarized. Extensive hepatic operations were performed in 99 (71.2%) patients, of them in 22.2%--on the concurrent hepatic cirrhosis background. Late results of treatment, depending on the main prognostic factors present, were analyzed. Cumulative survival in the terms of 5, 10 and 20 years have constituted 53.5, 37.3 and 28.8% accordingly. Accomplishment of a radical hepatic resection for HCC permits to achieve a durable remission of a tumoral process. While revealing a concurrent hepatic cirrhosis stage B (according to Child--Pugh classification) it is appropriate to use a hepatic transplantation and other methods of treatment, including chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, chemotherapy.
