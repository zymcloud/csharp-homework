Hepatocellular carcinoma with extension or metastasis to the right atrium is an uncommon form of cardiac malignancy. The authors report the case of a 51-year-old patient with hepatocellular carcinoma and thrombi in the portal and mesenteric veins, which histopathology revealed to be metastatic. Echocardiography showed a right atrial mass which in this context has to be considered as a possible cardiac metastasis.
