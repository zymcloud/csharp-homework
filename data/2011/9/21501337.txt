Hepatitis C is a chronic condition that many persons with haemophilia contracted in the 1980s due to the infusion of factor concentrates which did not have viral inactivation processes in place. Many patients with haemophilia are now living longer lives, well into 80 years of age, due to the improvement of their care. The effects of the HCV on the liver over time are now being realized as this population ages. Although the new treatments for hepatitis C have a prolonged response, as demonstrated by a persistent negative viral load, many haemophilia patients have either not responded to the therapy or had significant side-effects to the treatment, preventing continued therapy. Of these infected haemophiliacs with liver disease, many have demonstrated a slow progressive decline resulting in liver failure, cirrhosis or liver cancer. Liver transplant then becomes their only option. This article will review liver transplantation in the haemophilia patient highlighting three case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of specific short-term factor infusions and other haemostatic support to minimize bleeding during the surgical period. These cases confirm the opportunity for successful liver transplantation for haemophilia patients utilizing specific factor recommendations with minimal bleeding risk.
