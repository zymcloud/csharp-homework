Purpose:The maintenance of regional alliance clinical pathways for five cancers (lung, stomach, liver, large intestine, and breast) has been requested along with a readjustment of specific requirements for a plan to promote cancer control measures based on the Cancer Control Act. The aim of this study was to clarify the usefulness of regional alliance clinical pathways for cancer of the gastrointestinal tract in Tokushima Prefecture.Methods:Subjects comprised patients with digestive organ cancer who had undergone surgery at Tokushima University Hopsital between April 2009 and March 2010. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and it adjusted to the clinical pathways for cases that did not need postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.Results:This study was initiated in April 2009, and clinical pathways were used to 38 patients (gastric cancer, n = 17; colorectal cancer, n = 14; hepatocellular carcinoma, n = 7). Surgery was able to be performed. An especially severe problem like post operative complication was not appeared.Conclusion:Making feasible pathways for standardization of procedures throughout the prefecture is important for cancer treatment of the gastrointestinal tract in Tokushima Prefecture.
