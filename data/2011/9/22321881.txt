Objective:To detect the protein expressions of survivin and NF (nuclear factor)-κB and investigate their roles in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A total of 206 cases were diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma, and immunohistochemical technique was used to detect the protein expressions of survivin and NF-κB in hepatocellular carcinoma samples and normal liver tissue specimens. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze the relationship of protein expressions of survivin and NF-κB and clinico-pathological parameters and prognosis.Results:The expression of survivin was predominant in cytoplasm while that of NF-κB was in nucleolus. The positive rate of survivin protein was 78.2% in hepatocellular carcinoma and that of NF-κB was 81.1%. The positive rate of survivin and NF-κB was higher in hepatocellular carcinoma than that in benign hepatic tissue (11.7% and 15.5%). Significant differences existed in the expressions of survivin and NF-κB between hepatocellular carcinoma and normal hepatic tissue (P Conclusion:Protein expressions of survivin and NF-κB are higher in hepatocellular carcinoma. And they play mutually promoting roles in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, an important prognostic indicator may be adopted.
