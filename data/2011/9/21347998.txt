Two new oleanane-type triterpenoid saponins, 1 and 2, and a new natural product, 3, together with five known saponins, 4- 8, were isolated from the rhizomes of ANEMONE TAIPAIENSIS. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and chemical evidences. Six saponins, 1, 2, 4- 7, which possessed a free carboxylic group at C-28, exhibited significant cytotoxicity against human leukemia HL-60 cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep-G2 cells with IC (50) values in the range of 1.31-10.12 ÂµM.
