Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plays an important role in hepatocyte proliferation. HGF expression is regulated by various signaling molecules and nuclear receptors. In the present study, LiverCare(®) (LC), a novel polyherbal formulation (The Himalaya Drug Company, Bangalore, India), was evaluated for its efficacy, using co-cultures of primary rat hepatocytes-non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). The rate of primary hepatocyte co-culture proliferation was significantly and dose-dependently increased by LC as determined by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA and cell proliferation assay. LC also increased HGF expression in primary hepatocyte co-culture. Albumin and urea content remained constant during proliferation of hepatocyte co-cultures in the presence of LC with decreased activity of alanine aminotransferase. It is interesting that LC inhibited incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine into DNA in HepG2 cells. LC enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α expression during hepatocyte proliferation, whereas tumor necrosis factor-α expression remained unaffected. In conclusion, our study clearly showed that LC differentially regulates primary rat hepatocytes and human hepatocarcinoma cell proliferation. LC may be a promising candidate for treating degenerative liver diseases by enhancing liver regeneration.
