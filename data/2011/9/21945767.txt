Objective:To investigate the effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) on the proliferation of cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cells and explore which subtypes of EP prostanoid receptor mediate the action.Methods:RT-PCR was used to determine COX-2 and EP receptor mRNA expression levels in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep3B and human normal hepatocyte line QSG7701. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was employed to investigate the effect of PGE(2), selective EP2 receptor agonist butaprost and EP3/EP4 receptor agonist PGE1 alcohol on the proliferation of the cells.Results:COX-2 mRNA was highly expressed in Hep3B cells but scarcely in QSG7701 cells. Hep3B cells expressed the mRNAs for all the EP receptor subtypes, but EP2 and EP4 receptors were much more strongly expressed than EP1 and EP3 receptors. PGE(2) significantly promoted Hep3B cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and 10 Âµmol/L PGE(2) increased the cell proliferation by 22.57% (PConclusion:Selective activation of EP2 receptor promotes Hep3B cell proliferation, indicating the predominant role of EP2 receptor in mediating the mitogenic effect of PGE2.
