Objective:To investigate the therapeutic effect and safety of Sorafenib in the treatment of tumor recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Methods:Between January, 2009 and June, 2011, 10 patients with tumor recurrence after OLT were treated with Sorafenib (group A) and another 8 recipients received no Sorafenib treatment (group B); 25 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) also received Sorafenib treatment (group C). The tumor-bearing survival time, adverse effect and toxicity associated with sorafenib were compared between the 3 groups.Results:In group A, the median tumor-bearing survival time was 10 months (5-22 months), as compared to 4 months (1-8 months) in group B and 4 months (2-21 months) in group C, showing a significant difference in the survival time among the 3 groups (Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test, P=0.045). No recipient experienced acute graft rejection, but one recipient in group A died due to gastrointestinal bleeding. No significant difference was found in adverse effects associated with Sorafenib between groups A and C (PConclusion:Sorafenib can prolong the survival time of patients with tumor recurrence after OLT without increasing the risk of acute graft rejection.
