Objective:To explore the diagnostic significance of glypican-3 (GPC3) immunohistochemistry in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Fourteen tissue microarray paraffin blocks were constructed, which comprised 731 samples from hepatic tumors and paratumor tissues, including 357 cases of HCC, 26 cholangiocarcinoma, 171 HCC adjacent hepatic tissue including cirrhosis, 93 hemangioma adjacent hepatic tissues, and 84 carcinomas metastatic to liver. GPC3 (Clone 1G12) protein was detected immunohistochemically in all of cases with positive controls.Results:GPC3 protein was positive in 72.0% HCC (257/357), but negative in the rest 374 of non-HCC cases, including cholangiocarcinoma, HCC adjacent hepatic tissue including cirrhosis, hemangioma adjacent hepatic tissues and metastatic carcinomas. GPC3 positive percentage was significantly correlated with histological grading of HCC (P Conclusions:GPC3 is a valuable diagnostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma with sensitivity of 72.0%, and a differential diagnostic marker from tumor adjacent hepatic tissue and carcinomas metastatic to liver with specificity of 100%.
