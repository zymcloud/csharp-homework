Background:Currently, up-regulated proteins and apoptosis in hepatitis C is a hot topic in exploring the pathogenic mechanism of Heptitis C Virus(HCV). Some recent studies shows that prohibitin is overexpressed in cells expressing HCV core proteins, and up-regulated prohibitin is also found in human hepatoma cell line HCC-M, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and other cancers. Prohibitin is an important member of the membrane protein superfamily, and it plays a role of molecular chaperones in mitochondrial protein stability. Meanwhile, it has a permissive action on tumor growth or acts as an oncosuppressor. Based on our previously established the in vitro HCV cell-culture system (HCVcc), here we aimed to investigate the different expression profiles of prohibitin in Huh-7-HCV and Huh-7.5-HCV cellsMethods:The total cellular RNA of Huh-7, Huh-7.5, Huh-7-HCV and Huh-7.5-HCV cells were extracted, and then the first-strand cDNA was reversely transcribed. The expression of prohibitin at the mRNA level was assessed by real-time PCR with GAPDH as the control. Furthermore, the expression of prohibitin at the protein level was evaluated by western blot with GAPDH as an internal control.Results:Our results of real-time PCR showed that the mRNA expression level of prohibitin in Huh-7-HCV cells was 2.09 times higher than that in Huh-7 cells, while, the mRNA level of prohibitin in Huh-7.5-HCV cells was 2.25 times higher than that in Huh-7.5 cells. The results of western blot showed that the protein expression level of prohibitin in Huh-7-HCV cells was 2.38 times higher than that in Huh-7 cells, while the protein expression of prohibitin in Huh-7.5-HCV cells was 2.29 times higher than that in Huh-7.5 cells.Conclusions:The expression of prohibitin was relatively high in Huh-7-HCV and Huh-7.5-HCV cells harboring in vitro transcribed full-length HCV RNA.
