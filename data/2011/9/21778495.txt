Objectives:We assessed risk factors for 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1)-related hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death among New Mexico residents.Methods:We calculated population rate ratios using Poisson regression to analyze risk factors for H1N1-related hospitalization. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of hospitalizations during September 14, 2009 through January 13, 2010, using logistic regression to assess risk factors for mechanical ventilation and death among those hospitalized.Results:During the study period, 926 laboratory-confirmed H1N1-related hospitalizations were identified. H1N1-related hospitalization was significantly higher among American Indians (risk ratio [RR] = 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.2, 3.2), Blacks (RR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2, 2.4), and Hispanics (RR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.5, 2.0) than it was among non-Hispanic Whites, and also was higher among persons of younger age and lower household income. Mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with age 25 years and older, obesity, and lack of or delayed antiviral treatment. Death was significantly associated with male gender, cancer during the previous 12 months, and liver disorder.Conclusions:This analysis supports recent national efforts to include American Indian/Alaska Native race as a group at high risk for complications of influenza with respect to vaccination and antiviral treatment recommendations.
