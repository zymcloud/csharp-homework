Background:Many hepatobiliary centres are increasingly utilizing thermocoagulative devices such as bipolar-radiofrequency ablation (B-RFA). Compared with monopolar-radiofrequency ablation (M-RFA), B-RFA does not require grounding pads, thereby avoiding dermal burn injuries, and does not position probes directly into the tumour but rather on the perimeter. Additionally, B-RFA can precoagulate parenchyma to assist in hepatic resection. Herein, we report our early experience using B-RFA.Methods:A retrospective review identified 68 patients who underwent M-RFA or B-RFA between June 2004 and September 2010 in an academic centre. Peri-operative metrics were analysed.Results:M-RFA was used to treat 30 patients, whereas B-RFA was used for 17 patients. There were no differences in peri-operative metrics, survival or disease recurrence between M-RFA and B-RFA. Seventeen additional patients underwent B-RFA precoagulation during laparoscopic resection (segmentectomy in eleven patients and multi-segmental resection in six patients). Four patients with multifocal disease underwent procedures that combined B-RFA with resection.Conclusions:The early experience utilizing B-RFA demonstrates equivalency to M-RFA with respect to peri-operative metrics and survival. Moreover, B-RFA can be utilized to precoagulate tissue during a planned resection, making it not only a useful tool for tumour therapy but also a useful adjunct during surgical resections.
