Hepatocellular carcinoma mostly develops in patients with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A case is presented of a patient with hepatorenal syndrome as a sequel of liver cirrhosis due to HCV infection. Primary tumor of the liver was not diagnosed by routine procedures, but by fine needle aspiration cytology of the extensive osteolytic lesion of the pelvic bone, performed as part of the pre-transplantation workup. Transplantation procedure was abandoned because of inappropriate donor liver (hepatic artery thrombosis), and palliative pain-relieving irradiation was recommended. However, hepatic coma developed very rapidly and the patient died within a month of the diagnosis of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Although hepatocellular carcinoma metastases are not rare, massive bone infiltration from a primary tumor undetectable by routine methods is not frequently encountered.
