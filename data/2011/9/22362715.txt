Mouse hepatoma cellular carinoma cell line (Hca-F) cells have highly invasive and lymphatic metastasis potential in vitro and in vivo. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is an active component of the spice turmeric and has a diversity of antitumor activities. However, there is no available information to address the effects of curcumin on migration and invasion of mouse hepatoma Hca-F cells. In this study, we found that curcumin exerted a concentration- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the migration and invasion of Hca-F cells in vitro. Curcumin inhibited the expression of the tumor promoter caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in Hca-F cells. Up-regulation of Cav-1 expression by pcDNA3.1/Cav-1 plasmid was able to reverse the curcumin-induced antimigration and anti-invasion effects in vitro. Curcumin down-regulated the expression of cluster of differntiation (CD)147, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 and inhibited the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the phosphoinositilde 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and p44/42MAPK in Hca-F cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that curcumin can suppress the migratory and invasive ability of mouse hepatoma Hca-F cells, and this action is mediated through a novel mechanism involving inactivation of Cav-1 and EGFR signaling pathways.
