Objective:The quantitative parameters in the contrast-enhanced ultrasonography time-intensity curve of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were studied to explore their possible implication for histological grading of HCC.Methods:A total of 130 HCC patients (115 males and 15 females; age: 48.13±11.00 years) were studied using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography time-intensity curve and histological pathology. The quantification software Sonoliver® (TomTec Imaging Systems, Unterschleissheim, Germany) was applied to derive time-intensity curves of regions of interest in the interior of HCCs and in reference. Quantitative parameters of 115 patients were successfully obtained, including maximum of intensity (IMAX), rise time (RT), time to peak (TTP), rise slope (RS) and washout time (WT). Histological grading of HCC was performed using haematoxylin-eosin staining, and monoclonal antibodies specific for smooth muscle actin were used to observe unpaired arteries (UAs).Results:There were significant differences among WTs in the three differentiated HCC groups (pConclusion:WT plays an important role in predicting well, moderately and poorly differentiated HCC.
