Background and objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignant neoplasms worldwide, and is the second leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. E-cadherin is an epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and decreased E-cadherin expression in HCC is associated with a poor prognosis. This study investigates the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the E-cadherin/CDH1 gene promoter on the risk and clinicopathological characteristics of HCC METHODS: 131 HCC patients and 347 controls were recruited for this study. Genetic polymorphisms of CDH1-160 and -347 were analyzed by PCR-RFLP genotyping analysis.Results:After adjusting for other confounders, results show that individuals with the CDH1-347G/GA or GA/GA polymorphic genotypes had a significantly higher risk of developing HCC than those with the wild-type (G/G) genotype (adjusted odds ratio = 2.477; 95%CI: 1.421-4.319). Furthermore, patients with HCC with at least one mutant A allele of CDH1-160 had a 4.031-fold risk of progressing to stage III or IV.Conclusions:This study shows that SNPs in CDH1-347 gene are associated with an increased risk of HCC, and at least one mutant A allele of CDH1-160 gene is associated with the development of stage III or IV of HCC in Taiwanese.
