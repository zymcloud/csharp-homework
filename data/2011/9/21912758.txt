Selection of patients for curative treatment options for HCC depends on tumour bulk (size, number or volume) and liver function (as measured by Child-Pugh score, bilirubin and albumin levels, and portal hypertension). MVI is an important predictor of recurrence in early stage HCC but, unfortunately, is often only available on review of the surgical pathology after the therapy has already been performed. Patients can be transplanted beyond the Milan criteria with good outcomes, although biopsy and/or AFP should be used to exclude patients at the highest risk of recurrence.
