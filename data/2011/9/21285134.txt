Background:Perioperative chemotherapy improves outcome in resectable colorectal liver-only metastasis (CLM). This study aimed to evaluate perioperative CAPOX (capecitabine-oxaliplatin) plus bevacizumab in patients with poor-risk CLM not selected for upfront resection.Patients and methods:Poor-risk CLM was defined as follows: more than four metastases, diameter >5 cm, R0 resection unlikely, inadequate viable liver function if undergoing upfront resection, inability to retain liver vascular supply, or synchronous colorectal primary presentation. Patients underwent baseline computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or positron emission tomography (PET) for staging and received neoadjuvant CAPOX plus bevacizumab, with resectability assessed every four cycles. Primary end point was radiological objective response rate (ORR).Results:Forty-six patients were recruited, of which 91% underwent PET to ensure metastases confined to liver. Following neoadjuvant CAPOX plus bevacizumab, the ORR was 78% (95% confidence interval 63% to 89%). This allowed 12 of 30 (40%) patients with initial nonsynchronous unresectable CLM to be converted to resectability. In addition, 10 of 15 (67%) patients with synchronous resectable CLM underwent liver resection, with four additional patients being observed alone due to excellent response to neoadjuvant therapy. No grade 3-4 perioperative complications were seen.Conclusion:Neoadjuvant CAPOX plus bevacizumab resulted in a high response rate for patients with CLMs with poor-risk features not selected for upfront resection and converted 40% of patients to resectability.
