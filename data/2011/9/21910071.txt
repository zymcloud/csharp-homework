Objective:To study the inhibitory effect of Fuzheng Yiliu Granule (FYG) on hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and investigate the mechanism mediating its bioactivity.Methods:H22 tumor-bearing ICR mice were treated with FYG [3.6 g/(kg·d)] for 5 days. Tumor volume and tumor weight, percentages of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), and natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood, tumor apoptosis and serum levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were evaluated. FYG-containing serum was prepared from SD rats treated for 7 days [high dose 3.6 g/(kg·d); middle dose 1.8 g/(kg·d); low dose 0.9 g/(kg·d)]. Cell cycle, cell viability, and apoptosis were evaluated after HepG2 cell line was cultured in FYG-containing serum for 48 h. The levels of IL-2 and TNF-α in FYG-containing serum were also determined.Results:FYG produced a potent antitumor effect (PConclusion:FYG could inhibit HCC growth by regulating immune function and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo and in vitro.
