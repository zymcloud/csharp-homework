HCC is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Advances in cancer screening and surveillance have allowed for earlier detection of tumors, affording greater treatment potential. The advent of locoregional therapies has generated greater treatment options for patients with HCC. Either alone or in combination as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, these novel approaches continue to hold promise for improving morbidity and/or mortality of patients with HCC. The emergence of systemic molecular targeted therapies increases the role of translational science. Whereas surgical resection and transplantation conventionally form the cornerstone of curative approaches, the advancement of locoregional therapies holds great promise in adding to the curative armamentarium.
