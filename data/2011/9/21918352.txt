There are still no effective treatments against advanced hepatocarcinoma. One case of advanced hepatocarcinoma with multiple lung metastases, successfully treated with UFT, is reported here. After TAE in another hospital, the patient was refered to our hospital for treatment of multiple lung metastases. PIVKA-II and AFP decreased to normal levels after UFT was administered, and the multiple lung metastases disappeared as well. There are 13 cases including this one in which UFT was effective for hepatocarcinoma with multiple lung metastases. UFT is a possible home treatment because it is an orally administered anti-cancer drug that improves the patient's QOL. As UFT is one of the effective treatments for advanced hepatocarcinoma, it will be necessary to accumulate more data concerning its use, to apply it in the future.
