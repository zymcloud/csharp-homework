Acute pancreatitis is a rare side effect of non-selective transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma with an incidence ranging from 2% (clinical pancreatitis) to 40% (biological pancreatitis). This complication, due to embolization of extrahepatic arterial collaterals, has never been reported for treatment of well-differentiated endocrine carcinoma. We report here a case of acute clinical pancreatitis developing within 24 hours after a first selective TACE into the proper hepatic artery, with two peaks of hyperlypasemia, and intend to discuss its mechanism. Since it may clinically mimic a postembolization syndrome, dosage of serum pancreatic enzymes should be performed systematically in case of abdominal pain following TACE.
