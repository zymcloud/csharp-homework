Purpose:To assess the survival time of patients with HCC following transarterial chemoembolization performed in a highly selective and sequential way.Patients and methods:124 HCC patients (102 male, 22 female; mean age 63±11 years) treated with selective and sequential chemoembolization at a single center were included. Selective chemoembolization was performed through a coaxially introduced microcatheter in a segmental or subsegmental hepatic artery. Treatment was stopped after complete stasis of the blood flow in the tumor-feeding vessel. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival.Results:The median overall survival of the entire patient population was 27.2 months (mo) (±8.9 mo, 95% CI 9.8 mo, 44.6 mo). When stratified according to liver function the median survival was 46.1 mo (±9.0 mo; 95% CI 28.5 mo, 63.7 mo) for Child-Pugh A and 11.1 mo (±4.3 mo; 95% CI 2.7 mo, 19.5 mo) for Child-Pugh B (pConclusion:Selective and sequential chemoembolization offers long survival times in patients with HCC. Those patients with preserved liver function benefit more than patients with limited liver reserve.
