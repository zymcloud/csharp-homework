Many recent studies have shown the utility of microRNAs (miRs) as cancer-related biomarkers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between miR-203 expression and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis after liver transplantation (LT). Sixty-six HCC samples from patients who had undergone LT were examined for miR-203 expression using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The data were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis. Patient survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis of prognostic factors. We found that miR-203 expression was low in tumor tissues of patients (n = 16) with post-LT HCC recurrence in comparison with those in patients with non-recurrence (n = 50) (P = 0.003). Patients with higher miR-203 expression had significantly better recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.016 for RFS; P = 0.014 for OS). Multivariate analysis revealed that high-miR-203 expression was an independent predictor of good prognosis (HR 0.202, P = 0.006 for RFS; HR 0.332, P = 0.013 for OS). Our results suggest that miR-203 could be a novel prognostic marker in HCC patients who have undergone LT and might also be a potential therapeutic target.
