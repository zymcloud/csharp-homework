Background and aim:The PNPLA3 rs738409 C>G polymorphism has been found to be strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and with alcoholic liver disease. Whether the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism could be a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis patients is unknown.Methods:This study included 483 (344 males) consecutive Italian patients of Caucasian ethnicity affected by cirrhosis, of whom 279 had undergone transplantation for end-stage liver disease while 204 had been referred to our liver and transplant unit for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. The aetiologies were hepatitis C virus=209, hepatitis B virus=76, alcohol=166, metabolic=32. Ile148Met rs738409 transversion was genotyped using an restriction fragment length polymorphism-based assay.Results:The genotype frequencies of the rs738409 polymorphism were distributed differently in patients with cirrhosis C/C=168, C/G=220, G/G=95 vs controls C/C=218, C/G=175, G/G=35 (PConclusions:The PNPLA3 rs738409 C>G polymorphism is associated with cirrhosis. In synergy with gender, this polymorphism is a strong predictor of HCC occurrence among patients with cirrhosis.
