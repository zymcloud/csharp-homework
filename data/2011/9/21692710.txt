Objective:While marked changes in the frequency of hepatobiliary malignancies, most notably hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), have been observed in different populations, no such data have been reported for Germany. We aimed to provide epidemiological data on recent trends in liver-related mortality, specifically mortality from hepatobiliary malignancies, in Germany.Material and methods:We used incidence and mortality data to determine changes in the frequency of malignant and non-malignant liver disease in Germany over the past 30 years.Results:While overall liver disease mortality has slightly declined in Germany, deaths from hepatobiliary malignancies have declined in women, but remained constant in men. Among hepatobiliary malignancies, ICC stands out, because mortality has more than tripled both in men and women between 1998 and 2008. This is mirrored by a marked increase in new cases reported to local cancer registries, that is, incidence. Over the same time period, HCC and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) have remained largely constant while gall bladder cancers (GBC) have declined twofold. The rapid rise in ICC is in line with finding from different regions worldwide, but in contrast to recent data from Denmark and France, two of Germany's direct neighbors.Conclusions:The incidence of and mortality from ICC are rising markedly in Germany. The risk factors underlying this trend are as yet unclear.
