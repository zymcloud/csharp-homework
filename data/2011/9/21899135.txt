We report a case of 68-year-old-man with pulmonary metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Following right hepatic lobectomy in January 2005, 4 pulmonary metastases in the right lung were detected by chest computed tomography (CT) in September 2007. As chemotherapy was not effective, surgical resection (right upper lobectomy, partial resection of middle and lower lobe ) was performed. Secondary metastases in the left lung was detected in March 2008, and stereotactic radiotherapy was performed considering the site of tumor location and poor pulmonary function. Two years after radiotherapy, the patient is alive without recurrence.
