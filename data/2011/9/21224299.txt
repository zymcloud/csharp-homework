Objective:This study aimed to quantify intratumoural viable tissue perfusion with contrast-enhanced greyscale ultrasound to evaluate tumour response to anti-angiogenic treatment.Methods:H22 hepatoma-bearing mice were treated with low-dose thalidomide (Group B), high-dose thalidomide (Group C) or 0.5% carboxylmethylcellulose (Group A). Contrast-enhanced greyscale ultrasound was performed after 7 days of treatments to evaluate the percentage of non-enhanced area for each tumour; regions of interest within the enhanced area were analysed offline to determine the area under the curve (AUC), maximum intensity (IMAX), perfusion index (PI), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP) and quality of fit (QOF). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for evaluation of microvascular density (MVD).Results:The percentage of non-enhanced area was significantly larger in Group C than in Groups A and B (pConclusion:Quantitatively analysing intratumoural viable tissue perfusion enables early evaluation of tumour response to anti-angiogenic therapy before apparent changes in tumour necrosis.
