Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with metastasis to the heart is uncommon. We report a rare case of left atrial metastasis of HCC which was resected palliatively as a live-saving procedure with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Despite chemoembolization, which was undertaken 11 times, cardiac metastasis occurred. Moreover, the right and left atria and left ventricle were involved simultaneously. The severe dyspnea improved dramatically after surgery. Following this, the patient underwent systemic chemotherapy and lived a life without recurrence of symptoms associated with mitral valve obstruction.
