Aim:To determine the safety and usefulness of a novel anticancer drug, miriplatin, in transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.Patients and methods:Patients (n=115) who underwent TACE with miriplatin-lipiodol suspension (miriplatin group), and control patients (n=131) who underwent TACE with cisplatin-lipiodol suspension (CDDP group) took part in this study.Results:The overall incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in the miriplatin group. The percentage of patients attaining treatment effect 4 in both groups was not significantly different. The proportion exhibiting a >50% decrease in positive tumor markers following TACE was significantly greater in the CDDP group for alpha-fetoprotein, but not significantly different for des-gammma-carboxy prothrombin.Conclusion:Miriplatin-lipiodol suspension was associated with reduced intensity of adverse events and had comparable short-term therapeutic effects to cisplatin-lipiodol suspension, thereby indicating its usefulness in TACE.
