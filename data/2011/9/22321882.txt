Objective:To explore the expression and clinical significance of LI (liver-intestine)-cadherin mRNA and protein expression level in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical techniques were used to detect the expression of the LI-cadherin mRNA and protein in 56 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 44 cases of corresponding paracancerous tissues and 9 cases of normal liver tissues. The relationships with its clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed.Results:The mRNA of LI-cadherin was expressed in 56 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and 44 cases of corresponding paracancerous tissues. But its expression was not detected in normal tissues. Semiquantitative analysis showed that the mRNA expression level of LI-caherin was greater in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues than that in corresponding paracancerous tissues (0.653 ± 0.147 vs 0.534 ± 0.138). The differences were statistically significant (P Conclusion:The expression of LI-cadherin is up-regulated significantly in HCC. The over-expression of LI-cadherin protein is correlated with the lymph node metastasis and tumor thrombi in portal vein. It indicates that LI-cadherin may play an important role in the progression and metastasis of HCC.
