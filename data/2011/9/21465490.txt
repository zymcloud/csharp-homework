Background:The object of the current study was to review the outcomes of hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≥ 10 cm.Methods:Between 1995 and 2007, fifty-three patients with HCC ≥ 10 cm underwent hepatic resection, and clinical data were compared to those of patients with non-surgical treatment (n = 12). Surgical results for HCC ≥ 10 cm were compared to those of patients with HCC Results:Overall survival was significantly better in patients with hepatic resection for HCC ≥ 10 cm than in those with non-surgical treatment (P Conclusion:Hepatic resections for HCC ≥ 10 cm are safe and efficacious. Minimizing intra-operative blood loss and the establishment of an effective systemic treatment for patients with HCC ≥ 10 cm in T4 appear to be critical.
