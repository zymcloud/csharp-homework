Aim:To assess the association between Interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene IL-10-1082 (G/A), IL-10-592(C/A), IL-10-819 (T/C) polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility.Methods:Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedicine Database. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for IL-10 polymorphisms and HCC were calculated in a ﬁxed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate.Results:This meta-analysis included seven eligible studies, which included 1012 HCC cases and 2308 controls. Overall, IL-10-1082 G/A polymorphism was not associated with the risk of HCC (AA vs AG + GG, OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.90-1.37). When stratifying for ethnicity, the results were similar (Asian, OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.87-1.44; non-Asian, OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.75-1.60). In the overall analysis, the IL-10 polymorphism at position -592 (C/A) was identiﬁed as a genetic risk factor for HCC among Asians; patients carrying the IL-10-592*C allele had an increased risk of HCC (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.12-1.49). No association was observed between the IL-10-819 T/C polymorphism and HCC susceptibility (TT vs TC + CC, OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.79-1.32).Conclusion:This meta-analysis suggests that IL-10-592 A/C polymorphism may be associated with HCC among Asians. IL-10-1082 G/A and IL-10-819 T/C polymorphisms were not detected to be related to the risk for HCC.
