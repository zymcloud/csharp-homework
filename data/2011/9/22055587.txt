Background and study aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major burden on health-care systems worldwide. Although radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is currently considered the best technique for coagulative necrosis, the superiority of concomitant use of RFA and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) needs to be determined. The study was designed to compare efficacy, safety and rate of survival of patients with HCC assigned to receive combined PEI-RFA versus RFA alone and versus PEI alone.Patients and methods:This 3-year study enrolled 90 cirrhotic patients with HCC (Child's class A or B, but not class C). They were randomly assigned for either PEI-RFA (group I), RFA alone (group II) or PEI alone (group III). The primary end point was ablation of the tumour. The secondary end point was rate of survival and recurrence.Results:After the first session, complete ablation was significantly higher in the combination group (87.9%) compared with the RFA group (54.54%). After the second session, complete ablation was achieved in 97.0% of the combination group and in 84.8% of the RFA group. Regarding the PEI group, 75% had complete ablation, whereas 25% had partial ablation after multiple sessions. The survival rate, 1.5 years later, was significantly higher in group I (86.7%) compared with group III (63.3%). The overall incidence of serious adverse events was nil.Conclusion:Combined treatment is superior to RFA alone and to PEI alone, in safety and efficacy in patients with HCC.
