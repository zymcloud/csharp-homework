Background:The effectiveness of additional chemotherapy in preventing intrahepatic distant tumor recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully established. The authors compared the efficacy of 2 platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents in combination with radical local treatment for preventing intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR).Methods:Seventy-eight patients with stage I/II HCC aged 45 to 85 years underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and/or radiofrequency ablation after they received hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of platinum compounds. The HAI consisted of cis-diammine(1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II) (carboplatin) in 25 patients and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin) in 53 patients. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent factors that were associated with IDR.Results:Cumulative IDR rates at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 21.7%, 52.2% and 75.7%, respectively, in the carboplatin group and 8.1%, 22.7%, and 36.9%, respectively, in the cisplatin group. The cisplatin group had a significantly lower IDR rate compared with the carboplatin group. The selection of a platinum agent was 1 of the independent factors for IDR in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.Conclusions:HAI chemotherapy with cisplatin before radical local treatment was effective in patients with HCC. The authors concluded that radical local treatment with concurrent HAI using cisplatin may contribute to a longer progression-free period, which could be predicted with intrahepatic imaging in patients with stage I/II HCC.
