Sorafenib is a multi-target oral anticancer drug used as first-line treatment for patients with advanced human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). But the exact mechanism of sorafenib involved in HCC treatment is not clear yet. In this study, a comparative proteomic approach was performed to identify novel sorafenib-related proteins in HCC. Proteomes of HepG2 cells treated with sorafenib and the control (without sorafenib) were obtained by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis. Comprehensive analysis of proteins was focused on total protein spots to filtrate the different protein spots between the two groups. The differentially expressed proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Then, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to verify the expression of some candidate proteins. Results indicated that 19 protein spots were differentially expressed with significant changes, including 6 up-regulated proteins and 13 down-regulated proteins. It was confirmed by Western blot that expressions of Annexin A1 and cyclophilin A were down-regulated in sorafenib-treated HCC cell lines. Immunohistochemical study revealed their oncogenic role in HCC tissues. These observations might be novel findings leading to bring new insights into the exact mechanism of sorafenib and identify possible therapeutic targets.
