We present the case of a metastatic adrenal tumour from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) showing the uptake of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) on MRI. To our knowledge, this is the first case of metastatic HCC in which Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake was shown on MRI and this finding facilitated the accurate pre-operative diagnosis of a metastatic adrenal tumour.
