Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the liver is rare tumor with an unfavorable prognosis. We report a case of advanced primary SCC of the liver arising adjacent to a nonparasitic liver cyst, invading into the right diaphragm and the right lung tissue. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CE-US) demonstrated unique enhancement in the late vascular phase, which was incompatible with those observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma, or metastatic adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor followed by systemic chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP), while radiation chemotherapy was not applied because of relatively poor performance status. Although postoperative image analysis revealed no recurrence 4 months later, the patient died 13 months after the operation from recurrence. Immunohistological analysis of the resected specimen revealed that this SCC contained many capillary endothelial vessels expressing CD31 or CD34, possibly reflecting the unique imaging pattern in the late vascular phase of CE-US, which has been reported in choangiolocellular carcinoma. In addition, we reviewed which kind of treatment would be suitable for advanced hepatic primary SCC in the literature. From the review, it could be proposed that a combination of radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy (5-FU and CDDP) and surgical resection, if possible, is appropriate for advanced primary SCC of the liver.
