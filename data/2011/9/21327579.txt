In this study, the investigation of the expression of HIWI and its protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was performed, and the relationships between HIWI expression and the location of HCC metastases were analyzed. Sets of fresh HCC and matched adjacent normal hepatic tissue and paraffin-embedded tissue slides were provided by the hospital hepatology and pathology departments. RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect HIWI mRNA and protein. Correlations between HIWI expression and patient's age, sex, type of tumor, and metastasis location were recorded. HIWI mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent normal hepatic tissue (P
