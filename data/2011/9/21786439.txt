Purpose:Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHCC) is an uncommon form of cancer, and its clinicopathological features have rarely been reported in detail. This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of CHCC.Materials and methods:The clinicopathological features of patients diagnosed with CHCC at Severance Hospital between January 1996 and December 2007 were retrospectively studied by comparing them with the features of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or cholangiocarcinoma (CC) who had undergone a hepatic resection during the same period.Results:Forty-three patients diagnosed with CHCC were included in this study (M : F=35 : 8, median age, 55 years). According to the parameters of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging, there were 6 (14.0%), 9 (20.9%), 25 (58.1%), and 3 (7.0%) patients with stages I, II, III, and IV cancer, respectively. Thirty-two of the 43 patients underwent resection with curative intent. After resection, 27 patients (84.4%) had tumor recurrence during the follow-up period of 18 months (range: 6-106 months), and the median time to recurrence was 13 months. Overall median survival periods after hepatic resection of CHCC, HCC and CC were 34, 103 and 38.9 months, respectively (pConclusion:Even after curative hepatic resection, the presence of a cholangiocellular component appeared to be a poor prognostic indicator in patients with primary liver cancer.
