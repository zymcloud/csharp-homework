Background:Palladin is a metastasis-associated gene regulating cell motility. The expression of palladin protein in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PET) and carcinomas (PECA) is not known.Materials and methods:A tissue microarray (TMA) of well-differentiated (WD) PETs/PECAs (AJCC 2010) and non-neoplastic, histologically normal pancreatic tissue/islets (HNPIs) was immunostained with palladin antibody and quantified using the Allred score. The results were correlated with the presence or absence of liver metastases.Results:The retrospective study included 19 males and 19 females of age 27-79 years (mean 54). Tumor size was 0.9-11.5 cm (mean 3.8). Palladin expression was cytoplasmic and/or membranous. The tumors with high palladin expression were associated with liver metastasis (p<0.0001). All 14 primary PECA with hepatic metastases (MP-PECAs) exhibited palladin expression whereas 14 out of 24 (58%) clinically-localized primary PET (CLP-PETs) expressed palladin (p<0.01) with median Allred scores of 5 (range 3-7) and 2 (range 0-6) respectively (p<0.0001). The mean Allred score for the HNPIs in the MP-PECAs (N=6) was higher (4.2) as compared to that in the CLP-PETs (2.5,N=11) (p=0.23).Conclusion:Palladin may identify primary pancreatic endocrine neoplasms with a propensity to metastasize to the liver.
