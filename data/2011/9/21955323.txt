Background:Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1) is a newly identified gene that plays a role in colon cancer metastasis through upregulation of c-MET proto-oncogene (c-MET). However, the value of MACC1 as a potential biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown.Methods:MACC1 mRNA expression in 128 HCC tissues was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. To show the potential correlation of MACC1 and c-MET, c-MET was also analysed.Results:MACC1 was more highly expressed in HCC than in non-HCC tissues (P = 0.009). High MACC1 expression was significantly increased in cases with high alpha fetoprotein (AFP) (P = 0.025). A positive correlation was found between MACC1 and c-MET mRNAs (r = 0.235, P = 0.009). Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that MACC1 expression was associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, stratified analysis showed that tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage I patients with high MACC1 levels had shorter OS and DFS than those with low MACC1.Conclusions:MACC1 may identify low- and high-risk individuals with HCC and be a valuable indicator for stratifying the prognosis of TNM stage I patients. MACC1 may serve as a novel biomarker for HCC.
