Purpose:To investigate whether the right inferior phrenic artery (RIPA) has a role in supplying the liver in cirrhotic patients without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using 64-slice computed tomography (CT).Materials and methods:Fifty-eight consecutive cirrhotic patients were categorized into two groups in regard to the absence (group 1, n=33) or presence of portal vein thrombosis (group 2, n=25). In addition, 35 patients without liver disease were included as a control group (group 0). The diameters of the RIPA and left inferior phrenic artery (LIPA) were measured in the ascending portion of these vessels using arterial-phase CT images. The discrepancy between the diameters of the RIPA and LIPA were calculated. The diameters of the RIPA and LIPA and the discrepancy between the diameters of the RIPA and LIPA were then compared.Results:The characteristics of all RIPA and LIPA were visualized. The diameter of the LIPA among the three groups was not significantly different (P = 0.363). The mean diameters of the LIPA were 1.8±0.19, 1.8±0.22, and 1.7±0.38 mm for groups 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The diameter of the RIPA was significantly greater (2.1±0.54 mm) in groups 1 and 2 (1.9±0.19 mm) than in group 0 (1.8±0.18 mm). There was significantly difference between groups 0 and 2 (P = 0.003), and groups 1 and 2 (P = 0.01) with regard to the discrepancy of the diameters of RIPA and LIPA.Conclusion:The RIPA may contribute to the blood supply of the liver in cirrhotic patients, especially those with portal venous thrombosis.
