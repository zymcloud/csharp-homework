Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib combined with cryoablation in treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients with unresectable advanced HCC received cryoablation and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in 4-week cycles on the same day of the cryoablation. Tumor response, median overall survival and the median time to radiological progression were calculated and the toxicity was evaluated.Results:Seventy-eight patients with unresectable HCC were involved in this study. The median age was 52 years (range, 22-81 years). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status scores were 0 (39.7%), 1 (55.1%), and 2 (5.1%). Nine (11.5%) patients were at Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage A, twenty-four (30.8%) patients were at stage B and 45 (57.7%) patients were at stage C. Five (6.4%) achieved partial responses, and 34 (43.6%) achieved stable disease. The median time to progression (TTP) for all enrolled patients was 6.6 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 12.2 months.Conclusion:Cryoablation combined with sorafenib demonstrates good efficacy and acceptable tolerability in treating unresectable advanced HCC patients.
