Introduction:Auron Misheil Therapy was developed based on similarities between carcinogenesis and inflammation. Auron Misheil Therapy is a combination of natural and synthetic compounds, including anti-inflammatory drugs and insulin, expected to exhibit synergistic effects.Case presentation:Here, we report the case of a 78-year-old Caucasian male patient who presented with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Over a four-year period our patient was treated with radiofrequency ablation and transarterial chemoembolization. After these treatments there was tumor progression, with new hyperperfused lesions without evidence of extrahepatic tumor involvement. Our patient refused sorafenib therapy. Therefore, he received twice daily intramuscular injections of Auron Misheil Therapy on an outpatient basis for two months. Partial remission of the hepatic lesions was observed eight weeks after the start of treatment, and confirmed four weeks later. Unfortunately, at that time our patient refused therapy due to dizziness. During follow-up two target lesions remained stable, but one lesion increased in size. At the latest follow-up, one year later, there was still tumor control.Conclusion:While the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of Auron Misheil Therapy are not fully understood, stable disease and remissions have been observed in different types of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma.
