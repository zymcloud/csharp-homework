The purpose of this study was to appraise the imageologists of a possible mislocalization of tracer accumulation to anomalously placed gallbladder during positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) examination. PET/CT is increasingly playing an important role in staging and restaging of the disease process in cancer patients. With the advent of fusion imaging, the tracer accumulation can be correctly localized to a structure or lesion on CT. We did a staging PET/CT scan of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma for liver transplant evaluation. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) was used as a tracer and the scan was performed on SEIMENS Biograph-mCT PET/CT machine. We noted the tracer accumulation at the superior surface of liver, which was localized to the anomalously placed gallbladder in suprahepatic subdiaphragmatic location. The anomalously placed gallbladder can create localization confusion. Keeping the possibility of ectopically placed gallbladder in mind, the imageologist can better localize the tracer uptake.
