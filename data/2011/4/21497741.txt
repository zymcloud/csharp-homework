Both alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are relevant causes of cirrhosis and liver-related mortality. Alcohol abuse represents a major health problem in many countries, and liver disease is considered one of the most relevant causes of death related to this factor. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common hepatic abnormality in the Western world, and progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in a significant portion of cases. Moreover, presence of NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of fibrosis in alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, focussing on the diagnostic issues and predictive factors. In addition, the pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for appearance and progression of fibrosis in the two conditions are briefly discussed.
