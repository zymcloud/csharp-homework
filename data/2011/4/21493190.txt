Introduction:To assess the efficacy and safety profile of biweekly vinorelbine and tegafur/uracil (UFT) as treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes.Patients and methods:Patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer, measurable disease, no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status â‰¤2, and adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function were eligible. Patients received vinorelbine (30 mg/m(2) on day 1) and UFT (250 mg/m(2) daily) every two weeks for 12 cycles unless progression or unacceptable toxicity was observed.Results:Thirty-seven patients were included and received 311 cycles of chemotherapy. Efficacy and toxicity analyses were carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. The overall response rate was 35% (95% CI: 20-53). With a median follow-up of 18.6 months (95% CI: 1.0-74.3), the median time to progression was 7.0 months (96% CI: 5.2-8.9) and the median overall survival was 19.4 months (95% CI: 11.1-27.8). The most common severe toxicities were neutropenia (38% of patients) and asthenia (11% of patients).Conclusion:The combination of biweekly vinorelbine and UFT in patients with metastatic breast cancer pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes is a well tolerated and effective regimen.
