Aim:To identify the clinicopathological risk factors correlated with residual tumor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after resection.Methods:From January 2001 to April 2007, 766 HCC patients who had undergone resection were included in this research. Lipiodol angiography was performed within 2 mo after surgery and followed by post-Lipiodol computed tomography (CT) 4 wk later for all 766 patients to monitor tumor in the remnant liver. Tumor detected within the first 3-mo postoperative period was defined as residual tumor. Patients were divided into 2 groups: disease or disease-free within the first 3 mo after surgery. Risk factors for residual tumor were investigated among various clinicopathological variables.Results:A total of 63 (8.22%) patients were found to have residual tumor after surgery. Three independent factors associated with residual tumor were identified by multivariate analysis: preoperative serum Î± -fetoprotein (AFP) level [odds ratio (OR) = 1.68 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-2.36)], tumor size [OR = 1.73 (95% CI: 1.29-2.31)] and microvascular invasion [OR = 1.91 (95% CI: 1.12-3.24)].Conclusion:Residual tumor is related to AFP level, tumor size and microvascular invasion. Patients at high risk should undergo closer follow-up and could be candidates for multimodality therapy.
