A sustained virological response and improvement of liver function were achieved by low-dose interferon (IFN) therapy following curative treatment of initial and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in an 83-year-old man with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis (CLC). Although a fourth HCC episode recurred 16 months after IFN therapy, it was successfully treated. The patient is still alive 6 years and 7 months after diagnosis of the initial HCC and has been in a tumor-free state for 19 months following treatment of the last HCC. The results of this case suggest that, given sufficient consideration of adverse effects, IFN therapy for HCV and repeated local treatment for HCC contribute to improving the prognosis even in the case of a CLC patient over 80 years of age whose condition is complicated by recurrent HCC.
