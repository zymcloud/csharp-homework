Liver transplantation is considered to be the most efficient therapeutic option for patients with liver cirrhosis and early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of overall survival and recurrence rate. The application of restrictive selection criteria based on tumor size and number of nodules is advised to obtain optimal results. Nevertheless, tumor recurrence occurs in 3.5% to 21% of recipients, despite careful pretransplant staging and patient selection. Post transplant recurrence of hepatocarcinoma clearly has a major negative impact on prognosis. Intuitively, an immunosupressed state is undesirable in cancer patients. Inversely, modulation or minimization of immunosuppressive therapy could influence tumor progression and reduce the negative impact of recurrence on posttransplant survival. Experimental evidence shows that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects. Thus, their application has been proposed as antineoplastic agents for immunosuppressive protocols in liver transplant recipients with HCC and may reduce the rate or the impact of tumor recurrence. Clinical data about efficacy and safety of mTOR-based immunosuppressant protocols in liver transplant recipients with HCC show promising results, namely low recurrence and higher survival rates compared with standard calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressive protocols, even among patients with extended morphological criteria. The safety profile is regarded generally as adequate.
