Objective:To clarify the role of RhoC in the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and its molecular mechanism, so as to explore the molecular target of tumor cell growth.Methods:siRNA-RhoC plasmid was constructed and RhoC gene silencing the cell-line of hepatocellular carcinoma was setup. Cell growth was assessed by MTT assay. AgNORs staining was applied to determine cell proliferation. Plate cell clone test was conducted to examine the capacity of cell clone formation. FACS was adopted to measure the course of cell cycle and semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of cell cycle proteins. In order to further determine the effect of RhoC expression on cell growth, a RhoC over-expression human hepatocellular cell line was setup by PcDNA3-RhoC plasmid transfection.Results:The inhibition rate of RhoC was 82.3%. From the fourth day of cell culture, the growth of cells in RNAi group was significantly slower than that in parental Bel7402 and negative control groups (0.41 ± 0.10 vs. 0.73 ± 0.11 and 0.71 ± 0.07 respectively, P Conclusions:RhoC is the key molecule in promoting hepatocellular cell growth, and is a promising target for tumor cell growth controlling.
