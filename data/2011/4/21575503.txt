Objective:To observe and compare the response rate and toxicity of irinotecan or oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.Methods:Sixty-three patients with advanced gastric cancer were randomly divided into two groups. The CPT-11 + CAP group consisted of 32 patients who received irinotecan plus capecitabine: CPT-11 100 mg/m(2) was injected in 90 minutes on d 1, 8;capecitabine 2000 mg/m(2), bid, with the first dose in the evening of day 1 and last dose the morning of day 15, repeated for every 21 days. The L-OHP + CAP group consisted of 31 patients who received oxaliplatin plus capecitabine: oxaliplatin 100 mg/m(2) on day 1, capecitabine 2000 mg/m(2), bid, with the first dose in the evening of day 1 and last dose the morning of day 15, repeated for every 21 days. Two or more cycle chemotherapy was completed in each group.Results:In the CPT-11 + CAP group, no patient achieved complete response and 13 patients achieved partia1 response. The overall response rate was 40.6% (13/32), and the median progression-free survival time was 6.3 months. In the L-OHP + CAP group, no patient achieved complete response and 12 patients achieved partial response. The overall response rate was 38.7% (12/31), and the median progression-free survival time was 6.1 months. There was no significant difference between them (P > 0.05). The most common toxicities were gastrointestinal reaction, peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression in the two groups. Patients in CPT-11 + CAP group experienced more III/IV diarrhea (28.1%/3.2%, P = 0.018). On the contrary, the rate of III/IV neurotoxicity in the group B was higher (25.8%/3.1%, P = 0.027). No chemotherapy-related death occurred.Conclusion:The therapeutic effects of irinotecan or oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer are good and comparable, and their toxicities are tolerable.
