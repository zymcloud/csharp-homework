Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), usually performed under percutaneous ultrasound guidance, is considered the gold standard among minimally invasive therapies. On the strength of some recent randomized trials, its indications include operable patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma and inoperable patients with more advanced disease also in combination with other therapies. RFA has lower complication rates and costs less than surgery.
