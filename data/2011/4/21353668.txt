Introduction:Liver cancer (LC) is one of the most frequent tumours, in which the potentially curative treatment is surgery: partial surgical resection or liver transplant.Objectives:To determine the morbidity and mortality, survival, and their associated factors in patients with LC, according to the type of surgical treatment: partial surgical resection or liver transplant.Material and methods:A retrospective, observational follow-up study of LC patients diagnosed and treated from June 1994 to December 2007. A descriptive analysis of the variables was performed, as well as a Kaplan- Meier survival analysis and Cox regression.Results:The incidence of tumour recurrence in the 150 transplant patients was 13.3%, with a survival at 1, 3, and 5 years of 89.3%, 73.1% and 61.4%, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that only the histological grade/differentiation was an independent risk factor. In the 33 patients with partial surgical resection, the incidence of tumour was 51.5%, with a survival at 1, 3, and 5 years of 90.9%, 60.2%, and 38.6%, respectively. A significantly higher mortality was observed in patients with higher tumour and TNM staging.Conclusions:The survival throughout follow-up was higher in liver transplant, and tumour recurrence was more frequent in patients with partial surgical resection. The survival results in transplanted patients are consistent with the Spanish and European Liver Transplant Register and with the United Network for Organ Sharing register.
