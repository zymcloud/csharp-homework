A 21-year-old male patient was transferred to the emergency room of our hospital after suffering seat belt abdominal injury in a traffic accident. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a massive hematoma in the abdominal cavity associated with deep hepatic lacerations in the right lobe. The presence of a solid tissue possibly containing pneumobilia was observed above the greater omentum. These findings were consistent with a tentative diagnosis of hepatic laceration due to blunt trauma; therefore, this prompted us to perform emergency laparotomy. The operative findings revealed a massive hematoma and pulsatile bleeding from the lacerated liver and a retroperitoneal hepatoma, which was most likely due to subcapsular injury of the right kidney. In accordance with the preoperative imaging studies, a pale liver fragment on the greater omentum was observed, which was morphologically consistent with the defect in the posterior segment of the liver. Since the damaged area of the liver broadly followed the course of the middle hepatic vein, we carefully inspected and isolated the inflow vessels and eventually performed a right hepatic lobectomy. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was doing well at 10 months after surgery.
