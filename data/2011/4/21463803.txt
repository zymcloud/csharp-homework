Background:Low platelet count is a marker of portal hypertension but is not routinely included in the standard preoperative evaluation of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because it pertains to liver function (Child/model for end-stage liver disease [MELD] score) and tumor burden (Milan criteria). We hypothesized that low platelet count would be independently associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality after resection.Study design:Patients treated with liver resection for HCC between January 2000 and January 2010 at 3 institutions were eligible. Preoperative platelet count, Child/MELD score, and tumor extent were recorded. Low preoperative platelet count (LPPC) was defined as 7 mg/dL or development of ascites. Univariate and multivariate regression was performed for predictors of major complications, PLI, and 60-day mortality.Results:A total of 231 patients underwent resection, of whom 196 (85%) were classified as Child A and 35 (15%) as Child B; median MELD score was 8. Overall, 168 (71%) had tumors that exceeded Milan criteria and 134 (58%) had major hepatectomy (â‰¥3 Couinaud segments). Overall and major complication rates were 55% and 17%, respectively. PLI occurred in 25 patients (11%), and 21 (9%) died within 60 days of surgery. Patients with LPPC (n = 50) had a significantly increased number of major complications (28% versus 14%, p = 0.031), PLI (30% versus 6%, p = 0.001), and 60-day mortality (22% versus 6%, p = 0.001). When adjusted for Child/MELD score and tumor burden, LPPC remained independently associated with increased number of major complications (odds ratio [OR] 2.8, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.1 to 6.8, p = 0.026), PLI (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 11.1, p = 0.008), and 60-day mortality (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 14.6, p = 0.009).Conclusions:LPPC is independently associated with increased major complications, PLI, and mortality after resection of HCC, even when accounting for standard criteria, such as Child/MELD score and tumor extent, used to select patients for resection. Patients with LPPC may be better served with transplantation or liver-directed therapy.
