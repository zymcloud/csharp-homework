Objective:The survival of recurrent esophageal cancer is poor. But reports regarding prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival are limited. We analyzed the recurrence pattern and the prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with recurrence after resection.Methods:Two hundred sixty-eight patients were included. Tumor recurrence occurred in 115 (42.9%) patients. Recurrence pattern was classified as locoregional, distant, and combined recurrence. The post-recurrence survival was defined as the interval between initial recurrence and either death or the last follow-up.Results:Mediastinum lymphadenopathy was the most common site for locoregional recurrence, whereas lung, liver, and bone were the most common sites for distant recurrence. The overall 1- and 2-year post-recurrence survival rates were 32.6% and 12.6% with a median survival after recurrence of 6.0 months. The independent prognostic factors included liver recurrence (HR = 2.255, 95%CI = 1.073-4.741, p = 0.032), time to recurrence â‰¤10 months (HR = 2.657, 95%CI = 1.438-4.911, p = 0.002), and no treatment for recurrences (HR = 2.745, 95%CI = 1.635-4.608, p < 0.001).Conclusions:We identify liver recurrence, early recurrence, and no treatment for recurrence as risk factors for dismal post-recurrence survival.
