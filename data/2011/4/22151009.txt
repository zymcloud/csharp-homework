Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. The most common problem associated with HCC is a high risk of intrahepatic recurrence despite radical treatment, and in many patients, this recurrence has fatal consequences. For patients with advanced-stage HCC according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system, the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the current standard of care. In contrast, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is the recommended treatment in Japan for patients with intermediate-stage or advanced-stage HCC. In this review, we describe the use of HAIC for advanced HCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate an alternative therapy for HCC, the iron chelator deferoxamine, and discuss future therapeutic possibilities.
