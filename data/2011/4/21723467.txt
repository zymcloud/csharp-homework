Objective:Lymph node metastasis (LNM) rarely occurs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Few studies have reported the potential risk factors of LNM and the influence of LNM on the progression and prognosis of HCC. The purposes of this study were to explore the clinicopathological characteristics of operable HCC with LNM and to demonstrate the effects of LNM on HCC prognosis.Methods:A retrospective review of 2,034 HCC patients undergoing surgery from 1982 to 2005 was performed. The influence of LNM was assessed by clinicopathological factors, tumour recurrence, and overall survival. A total of 66 randomly selected patients matched for clinicopathological variables were used to analyse the difference in survival.Results:A total of 25 patients (1.23%) were reported to have LNM. Higher preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels (> 10 ng/mL) were significantly associated with a higher incidence of LNM than were low preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels (â‰¤ = 10 ng/mL) (15.38%vs. 3.79%, p = 0.042). Furthermore, HCC with LNM (N1 disease) was larger in size (mean, 9.44 vs. 5.85 cm, p = 0.016) and significantly associated with vascular invasion, worse histological grade, and nonencapsulation (p = 0.002, Conclusion:This study identified the worst prognosis of HCC in a population with LNM. HCC with LNM tends to be the infiltrating type with larger tumour size (> 5 cm), presence of microvascular invasion, and worse histological grade. Liver resection with lymphadenectomy is possibly beneficial for patients with HCC accompanied by LNM.
