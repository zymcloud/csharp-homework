Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is currently one of the most common forms of liver disease, covering cases from simple steatosis without inflammation, to cases of steatohepatitis and fibrosis, and may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathophysiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is based on multiple events; changes in the secretion of lipoproteins can lead to steatosis. Liver lipid secretion is mediated by apoB100 and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). The pharmacological suppression of MTP is suggested as a possible treatment for hyperlipidemia, although the upregulation of this protein can be a treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
