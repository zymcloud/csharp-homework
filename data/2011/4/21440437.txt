New indoline alkaloid-type compounds which inhibit HCV production by infected hepatoma cells have been identified. These compounds, dimeric-type compounds of previously known inhibitors, display double digit nanomolar IC(50) and EC(50) values, with cytotoxicity CC(50) indexes higher than 36 Î¼M, thus providing ample therapeutic windows for further development of HCV drugs.
