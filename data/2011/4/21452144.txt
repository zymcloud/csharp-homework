Liver transplantation is the only curative therapy for many liver diseases, mostly chronic liver diseases, occasionally also in acute or fulminant liver failure. Currently, about 100 liver transplantatations are performed each year in Switzerland. Clichy criteria are used for acute liver failure. Liver transplantation for liver cirrhosis improves survival if the Meld-Score is above 15. 5- and 10-year-survival after liver transplantation are 71% and 61%, respectively. With increasing survival after liver transplantation, the management of drug side effects in the late postoperative course becomes important.
