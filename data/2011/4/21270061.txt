Background:Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) has been suggested to play an important role in solid tumours. Although several reports have shown the relationship between VEGFR2 expression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the expression pattern of VEGFR2 in HCC parenchyma or stroma, as well as the relationship between VEGFR2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics in HCC, are yet to be satisfactorily defined.Methods:One-step real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to characterise the expression of VEGFR2 in HCC using a self-made anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody (A8H1).Results:Expression of VEGFR2 in HCC cells was higher than in hepatic cells (pConclusions:The efficacy of A8H1 in immunohistochemistry using HCC tissues was confirmed. There was a correlation of high VEGFR2 expression with prognostic significance in HCC. Additionally, the self-made anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody could be used for future anti-HCC-targeted therapy research.
