Aim:To determine the effect of Legalon-SIL (LS) on hepatitis C virus (HCV) core and NS5A expression and on heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX-1) and its transcriptional regulators in human hepatoma cells expressing full length HCV genotype 1b.Methods:CON1 cells were treated with 50 μmol/L or 200 μmol/L LS. Cells were harvested after 2, 6 and 24 h. HCV RNA and protein levels were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively.Results:HCV RNA (core and NS5A regions) was decreased after 6 h with LS 200 μmol/L (P < 0.05). Both 50 and 200 μmol/L LS decreased HCV RNA levels [core region (by 55% and 88%, respectively) and NS5A region (by 62% and 87%, respectively) after 24 h compared with vehicle (dimethyl sulphoxide) control (P < 0.01). Similarly HCV core and NS5A protein were decreased (by 85%, P < 0.01 and by 65%, P < 0.05, respectively) by LS 200 μmol/L. Bach1 and HMOX-1 RNA were also downregulated by LS treatment (P < 0.01), while Nrf2 protein was increased (P < 0.05).Conclusion:Our results demonstrate that treatment with LS downregulates HCV core and NS5A expression in CON1 cells which express full length HCV genotype 1b, and suggests that LS may prove to be a valuable alternative or adjunctive therapy for the treatment of HCV infection.
