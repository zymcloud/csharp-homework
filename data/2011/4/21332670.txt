Objectives:Previous studies have demonstrated a relationship between elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and shorter survival in cancer patients. Few studies, however, have investigated the role of serum CRP levels in oral squamous cell carcinoma. The present study was conducted to analyze the relationship between preoperative CRP levels, clinicopathologic factors, and prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.Design:Retrospective clinical study.Setting:University teaching hospital.Participants:Eighteen oral cavity leukoplakia and 59 oral squamous cell carcinoma patients between November 2006 and November 2009 from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.Outcome measures:Clinicopathologic parameters, disease-free survival and overall survival were correlated with CRP levels.Methods:Serum CRP levels were measured preoperatively, and all oral cavity cancer patients underwent curative intent radical surgery with or without postoperative adjuvant therapy.Results:The CRP levels in leukoplakia patients were used to analyze if factors (including diabetes and liver cirrhosis, smoking, alcohol drinking and areca quid chewing) influence CRP levels, and the results demonstrated they were not associated with CRP elevation (> 5.0 mg/L) (P > 0.05). In oral cancer patients, elevated CRP levels were associated with tumor status (P = 0.005), tumor stage (P = 0.054), bone invasion (P = 0.033), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.004) and lymph node extra-capsular spread (P = 0.018). Patients with higher CRP levels showed poorer disease-free survival (log rank test, P < 0.001) and overall survival (log rank test, P = 0.013).Conclusions:Preoperative serum CRP levels are associated with advanced tumor stage, bone invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymph node extra-capsular spread and patients' survival. CRP is thus potentially a prognostic indicator, but studies with longer follow-up will be needed to confirm its reliability.
