5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy is the first choice treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and resistance is the major obstacle to successful treatment. Recent studies have reported that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with chemoresistance in cancers. We speculated that EMT and 5-FU metabolism are related to the mechanism of 5-FU resistance. First, two 5-FU-resistant cell lines, HLF-R4 and HLF-R10, were established from the HLF undifferentiated human HCC cell line. Whereas cell growth was similar in the HLF and HLF-R cell lines, HLF-Rs are about 4- and 10-fold more resistant compared with the HLF cells; thus, we named these cell lines HLF-R4 and HLF-R10, respectively. The terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay also showed a dramatically decreased number of apoptotic cells in the HLF-Rs after treatment with 5-FU. We next assessed the characteristics of the HLF, HLF-R4 and HLF-R10 cells. Consistent with our hypothesis, the HLF-Rs had typical morphologic phenotypes of EMT, loss of cell-cell adhesion, spindle-shaped morphology and increased formation of pseudopodia. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data showed downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated Twist-1 and also indicated that EMT changes occurred in the HLF-Rs. We also found decreased ribonucleotide reductase and increased multidrug resistance protein 5 genes in the HLF-R cells. Our results suggested that the metabolism of EMT and 5-FU has important roles in 5-FU chemoresistance in the HLF-R cells, and that the HLF-R cells would be useful in vitro models for understanding the 5-FU-resistant mechanisms in HCC.
