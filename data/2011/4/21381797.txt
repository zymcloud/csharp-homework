The purpose of this study was to evaluate acute toxicity of craniospinal irradiation (CSI) using helical tomotherapy (HT) and compare its dose distribution with that of conventional linac-based plans. Twelve patients with various brain tumors were treated with HT-CSI. Median patient age was 14 years (range: 4-37 years). Median CSI dose was 30.6 Gy in 18 fractions (range: 23.4-40 Gy in 13-25 fractions). Toxicities were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Before CSI, 11 patients (92%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, so acute toxicity was evaluated by comparing patient status before and after CSI. HT-CSI plans were compared with linac-based CSI plans made using Pinnacle(3) planning system in 9 patients. All patients completed planned CSI without interruption. Grade 3 or higher toxicities were leukopenia seen in 11 patients (92%), anorexia in 6 (50%), anemia in 5 (42%), and thrombopenia in 5 (42%). Administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, platelet transfusion and total parenteral nutrition were required in 8 (67%), 5 (42%) and 5 (42%) patients, respectively. HT plans were superior to linac-based plans in terms of homogeneity and conformality in planning target volume (PTV). For most organs at risk (OARs), volumes receiving more than 10 Gy (V10 Gy) or 20 Gy (V20 Gy) were lower in HT plans. However, HT plans significantly increased mean doses to the lung, kidneys and liver, and V5 Gy of 6 OARs including the lung. Despite intensive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, acute toxicity of HT-CSI was acceptable. HT provided better dose distribution in PTV than conventional linac. In most OARs, smaller volumes received >10-20 Gy in HT plans, although larger volumes received 5-10 Gy.
