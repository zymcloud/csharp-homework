Background:Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I molecule that has multiple immune regulatory functions including the induction of immune tolerance. The detection of HLA-G expression might serve as a clinical marker in the prediction of clinical outcomes for certain types of carcinoma. Currently, we investigated whether or not HLA-G is also expressed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and whether the expression has clinical value.Methods:Serum levels of secreted HLA-G (sHLA-G) were measured by ELISA in 36 patients with HCC, 25 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and 25 healthy individuals. The expression of HLA-G in liver tissue was further studied using Western blotting in 36 patients with HCC and 25 with LC. The correlations between HLA-G status and various clinicopathological parameters including survival were analyzed.Results:The ELISA assay showed that the serum levels of sHLA-G in the HCC, LC and healthy groups were 132.6+/-31.4, 63.5+/-22.1, and 47.0+/-15.5 U/ml, respectively. Analysis of variance was used for inter-group comparison and differences were found between the HCC group and the other two groups (both PConclusion:Our results indicated that the expression of HLA-G was a characteristic feature of HCC and patients with positive expression of HLA-G in malignant liver tissue had a poor prognosis.
