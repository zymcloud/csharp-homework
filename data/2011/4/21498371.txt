Background:Rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a life-threatening condition accompanied by hemorrhage. Transarterial embolization/chemoembolization (TAE/TACE) can be used as the first-line treatment to achieve initial homeostasis.Purpose:To investigate the outcome of TAE/TACE for spontaneous ruptured HCC and to determine the prognostic factors affecting survival.Material and methods:We retrospectively reviewed the clinicoradiologic data of 47 patients (8 women, 39 men; median age 64.4 years) with serum bilirubin levels Results:The clinical success rate of TAE/TACE was 94% (44/47). The median survival time was 179.6 days. The 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month survival rates were 75%, 54%, 48%, and 43%, respectively. Old age, a previous history of TACE for HCC, low initial hemoglobin level, higher blood transfusion requirement, Child-Pugh class C, high serum bilirubin level, low serum albumin level, prolonged prothrombin time, high serum creatinine level on admission, presence of encephalopathy, severe ascites, lobar TAE/TACE, presence of portal vein thrombosis, and tumors involving both lobes were associated with poor survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher blood transfusion requirement, Child-Pugh class C, presence of portal vein thrombosis, and tumors involving both lobes were significant predictors of poor survival.Conclusion:TAE/TACE is effective for achieving initial hemostasis, which is critical to survival. Regardless of successful TAE/TACE, the survival rate in patients with Child-Pugh class C remains poor. Portal vein thrombosis and tumor extent are significant image parameters for predicting survival after TAE/TACE for ruptured HCC.
