Background and aims:Kupffer imaging in contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with Sonazoid, which lasts for 60 min or longer, may be useful in ultrasound-guided percutaneous tumor ablation. The utility of Sonazoid in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated in this study.Methods:We analyzed a total of 716 HCC nodules that were detected on dynamic computed tomography in 316 patients. Detectability of these nodules was compared between CEUS and conventional ultrasonography. The effectiveness in the treatment was assessed by comparing the mean numbers of treatment sessions of RFA in patients treated with CEUS and that in historical controls matched for tumor and background conditions.Results:Detectability of tumor nodule was 83.5% in conventional ultrasonography and 93.2% in CEUS (P=0.04). Sixty-nine nodules in 52 patients were additionally detected with CEUS. The number of additionally detected tumor nodules was positively correlated with serum albumin level (P=0.016). The number of RFA sessions was 1.33±0.45 with CEUS as compared to 1.49±0.76 in the historical controls (P=0.0019).Conclusions:CEUS with Sonazoid is useful for HCC detection in patients with a well-conserved liver function reservoir. The decrease in RFA session numbers indicated the utility of Sonazoid in RFA treatment of HCC.
