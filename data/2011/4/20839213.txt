Phytochemical investigation of the CH(2) Cl(2) extract of the aerial part of Hypericum sampsonii yielded two new prenylated xanthones, hypericumxanthone A and B, together with three known xanthones. Their structures were elucidated by analysis of physical and spectral (UV, IR, mass and NMR) data and comparison of spectroscopic data with those reported previously. All these compounds were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Two new compounds were also tested for their cytotoxicity against human breast (MCF-7), hepatoma (HepG2), colon (HT-29) and lung (A549) tumour cell lines. Two new compounds showed moderate antibacterial activities at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 16 and 32 µg/mL, respectively, whereas the positive standard antibacterial drug, vancomycin, showed an MIC of 8 µg/mL. The other compounds were inactive against MRSA. In addition, hypericumxanthone B showed weak inhibitory activities against four human tumour cell lines.
