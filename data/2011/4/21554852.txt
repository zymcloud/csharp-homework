Termocoagulation by radiofrequency (RF) is widely used for ablation of liver neoplasms. Recently, innovative uses of RF were proposed, as to assist liver resection, to help partial splenectomy, or to treat ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma. A 21 years old man was admitted for massive haemorrhage from a right thoraco-abdominal knife wound. Massive haemothorax was drained but arterial bleeding was caused by a deep penetrating wound on liver segment VIII. During operation, considering the difficult exposure of the source of bleeding, it was taught to stop haemorrhage using RF termocoagulation, under ultrasonographic guidance. Termocoagulation of the pedicle of the liver segment VIII was performed. In this patient with haemorrhagic shock the RF method for bleeding control was very easy and effective, and avoided risks of morbidity due to a major procedure.
