Background and aim:The conventional method of anatomical right hemihepatectomy (ARHH) requires hilus dissection. We report a method without hilus dissection to minimize intraoperative bleeding.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated data of 107 patients who received ARHH involving ligation of corresponding inflow and outflow vessels (LCIOV) without hilus dissection between January 2000 and October 2008. Results were compared to those of patients who underwent non-anatomical right hemihepatectomies (NARHH).Results:The two groups had similar gender and age (both, P>0.05). The LCIOV group had a higher percentage of patients without intrahepatic metastases (94.6% vs 80.3%, P=0.003). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesion size (9.3 vs 10.2, P=0.023), durations of inferior vena cava occlusion (4 vs 4.7, PConclusion:The reported method is a safe and bloodless technique for right hemihepatectomy in select patients.
