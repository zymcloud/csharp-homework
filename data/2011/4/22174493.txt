The residual liver function is a major clinical index in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. As the liver plays a crucial role in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, the significant impairment of the hepatic function occurring during chronic liver diseases, such as HCC, can influence plasma lipoprotein profiles. Although, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) circulating concentrations are mostly determined by genetic factors, in the majority of reports they have shown a correlation with the hepatic status and a significant decrease in HCC and liver cirrhosis patients than among the controls. In such a way, Lp(a) may represent a new additional and useful marker for a more complete assessment and monitoring of the liver function in patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate the clinical significance of Lp(a) in HCC.
