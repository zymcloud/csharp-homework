Background:With the aging population, more elderly patients are being considered for hepatic resection. We investigated whether advanced age was associated with higher rate and severity of postoperative complications.Methods:A total of 75 patients aged ≥70 years (group E) were matched with 75 patients aged <70 years (group Y) by the extent of liver resection and by operative indications. Primary outcome measures were rates and severity of complications. Secondary outcome measures were length of hospital stay and discharge destination. Univariate analysis was also performed to identify variables associated with higher surgical risk.Results:Male-to-female ratio was 43:32 in both groups. Overall complication rates were 44 and 33.3% in group E and Y, respectively (P = 0.241; odds ratio = 1.57; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.81-3.05). There was no mortality in both groups. The only postoperative age-related morbidity was confusion in the elderly. There was no difference in the rates of severe complications (grade ≥3) between group E and group Y (16 vs. 14.7%; P = 0.744; odds ratio = 1.11; 95% CI, 0.46-2.70). Median length of hospital stay were 7 and 6 days, respectively (P = 0.01). Nineteen percent and 1% of patients in group E and group Y were discharge to rehabilitation facilities, respectively (P = 0.001). Univariate analysis showed that preoperative systemic chemotherapy and longer operative time were associated with higher morbidity in the elderly.Conclusions:Liver resection can be performed in patients aged ≥70 years as safely as in younger patients. Duration and timing of systemic chemotherapy before liver resection should be optimized to minimize postoperative morbidity.
