The present study evaluated the plausible role of circulating biomarkers in immune pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis considered a priority in clinical hepatology. Total viral load of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients was quantified and correlation studies were performed with circulating levels of Th1/Th2 cytokines; C reactive protein and circulating nucleosomes; glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase. To our knowledge, the study is first among its kind that validates strong positive correlation of viral load with IL-4, IL-6, GR in HBV and IL-6, IL-10, GR in HCV infections. Although, multi-centric studies including large cohorts are required for translating our findings to clinical practice, however, role of these biomarkers with potential diagnostic or prognostic significance might be helpful in clinical assessment of high-risk individuals, thereby, designing interventional strategies, towards development of personalized medicare. The results of our study also offer valuable insights of immune signaling mediators engaged in development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
