Aims:Pifithrin α (PFTα), an inhibitor of the p53 protein, is regarded as a lead compound for cancer and neurodegenerative disease therapy. There is some evidence that this compound activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in a complete independent way of the p53 inhibition and that it is easily converted to its condensation product pifithrin β (PFTβ). The aim of this study was to explore the ability of PFTα and of PFTβ to induce a variety of AhR mediated processes.Main methods:Computational analysis using quantum chemical calculations and chemical analysis have been used to study the conformation of the compounds as well as the cyclization reaction. The AhR mediated processes of these compounds have been studied in a rainbow trout cell line (RTG-2) and in a rat hepatoma cell line (H4IIE).Key findings:PFTα molecule could not take a planar conformation required for AhR activation whereas PFTβ showed a conformation similar to those of the prototypical AhR ligand β-naphthoflavone. In both cell lines, PFTα and PFTβ provoked different responses related with AhR activation. However, when cyclization of PFTα to PFTβ was hampered by acetylation of the exocyclic nitrogen, all these responses were not observed. These results lead to the conclusion that the activation of the AhR is probably caused by PFTβ instead of PFTα.Significance:Since PFTα is a promising compound for the development of new pharmaceuticals inhibiting p53, the chemical instability of this compound as well as the capacity of its transformation product should be taken into account.
