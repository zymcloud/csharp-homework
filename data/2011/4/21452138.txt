Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as one entity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and accompanies the rise in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia in the western world. It is not known why some patients progress in the disease and develop inflammation in the liver, whereas others remain in the stage of simple steatosis, which generally has a benign course. However, NASH can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, it is important to determine the stage of the disease in patients presenting with the metabolic syndrome and abnormal liver function tests, suggesting NAFLD. Liver biopsy is the only tool that allows for reliable detection, grading and staging of liver disease. The main strategies in the treatment of NASH are correction of risk factors (lifestyle modifications, insuline sensitizer) and anti-oxidants (ursodeoxycholic acid, vitamin E) which both have been shown to improve liver histology as well as liver enzymes. Patients wih alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) present the same liver histology and often also metabolic alterations similar to metabolic syndrome. Therefore, MAFLD (metabolic syndrome-associated fatty liver disease) might describe both patient populations more accurately and also describes the pathophysiological characteristics.
