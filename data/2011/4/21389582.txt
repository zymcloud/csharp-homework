We describe hybrid nanoparticles, composed of iron oxide and gold nanoparticles, as potential dual contrast agents for both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The hybrid nanoparticles are synthesized by thermal decomposition of mixtures of Fe-oleate and Au-oleylamine complexes. Using a nano-emulsion method, the nanoparticles are coated with amphiphilic poly(DMA-r-mPEGMA-r-MA) to impart water-dispersity and antibiofouling properties. An in vitro phantom study shows that the hybrid nanoparticles have high CT attenuation, because of the constituent gold nanoparticles, and afford a good MR signal, attributable to the contained iron oxide nanoparticles. Intravenous injection of the hybrid nanoparticles into hepatoma-bearing mice results in high contrast between the hepatoma and normal hepatic parenchyma in both CT and MRI. These results suggest that the hybrid nanoparticles may be useful as CT/MRI dual contrast agents for in vivo hepatoma imaging.
