Purpose:To compare the image quality and diagnostic performance of 1- and 3-h delayed-phase MR images (DPIs) after gadobenate dimeglumine injection in detecting small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in cirrhotic patients.Materials and methods:Relative enhancement of the liver (RE(liver) ) and HCC (RE(HCC) ) and liver-to-lesion contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of HCC were measured quantitatively on 1- and 3-h DPIs in 65 patients with 88 HCCs. For qualitative analysis, two radiologists independently evaluated three image sets in 19 patients with 25 HCCs â‰¤ 2 cm and in 16 controls without HCCs: conventional liver MR without DPI (set A), adding 1-h DPI (set B), and adding 3-h DPI (set C), using a 5-point scale for diagnosing small HCCs. Diagnostic performance for small HCCs was analyzed using the alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic method.Results:Mean RE(liver) (P = 0.013) and RE(HCC) (P Conclusion:In cirrhotic patients, 3-h DPI provides a higher liver-to-lesion contrast and a better diagnostic performance for small HCCs than 1-h DPI.
