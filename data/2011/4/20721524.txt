Bladder cancers account about 3% of malignant tumors and often metastasize to regional lymph nodes, liver, lungs and skeleton. Metastases in the area of the orbital region are very rare. When eyelid swelling, proptosis, diplopia, or ocular pain occurs, an underlying neoplastic process should always be suspected. Due to the rapid progression of orbital metastases, diagnosis and early initiation of palliative therapy is important.
