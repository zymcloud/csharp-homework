Aims:Here we reassess anticipated inability to obtain a microscopically clear surgical margin as an absolute contraindication to surgery for colorectal liver metastases in view of improvements in treatment modalities adjunctive to surgery.Methods:We retrospectively analysed 310 patients treated at our institution to estimate the survival benefit from R1 hepatectomy performed to remove liver metastases from colorectal cancer.Results:Considering all 310 patients evaluated, the R1 resection group (positive margin; n = 55) showed a lower disease-free rate (P < 0.01) and worse overall survival (P < 0.01) than the R0 resection group (negative margin; n = 255). When patients were divided according to initial resectability, similar differences in disease-free rate and overall survival (P = 0.03) between R1 (n = 19) and R0 (n = 182) were observed in patients whose metastases were resectable. However, superior impact of R0 resection (n = 73) compared to R1 resection (n = 36) on disease-free rate (P = 0.44) and overall survival (P = 0.50) was not confirmed in patients with initially unresectable or marginally resectable metastases, especially those with a favourable response to prehepatectomy chemotherapy.Conclusions:A predicted positive surgical margin after resection no longer should be an absolute contraindication to surgery for aggressive or advanced liver metastases.
