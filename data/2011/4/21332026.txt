The phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3 K)/Akt pathway controls the activity of a number of proteins important in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation. FoxO (forkhead box, class O) transcription factors, substrates of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt, control the expression of several target genes that are crucial to the defense against oxidative stress, the regulation of cell cycle, and apoptosis in mammalian cells. Here, expression of ceruloplasmin (CP), the major copper-containing protein in blood released by the liver, was investigated. We observed a significant downregulation of CP mRNA levels after insulin treatment in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin counteracted this insulin effect on CP mRNA levels, indicating that the PI3K/Akt cascade is involved in the regulation of CP expression. Stimulation of FoxO1 was induced in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells expressing a conditionally active FoxO1 construct, resulting in significant upregulation of CP mRNA levels. This upregulation was prevented in the presence of insulin. In parallel, mRNAs of established FoxO target genes were analyzed: like CP mRNA, selenoprotein P and glucose 6-phosphatase mRNAs were upregulated by FoxO1, which was prevented by insulin. The same effects of insulin on CP mRNA levels were detected in primary rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, CP release into cell culture media was analyzed with primary hepatocytes and found to be attenuated by insulin. In line with its insulin-mimetic effects on cultured cells, Cu (2+) imitated the effect of insulin on CP expression and caused a downregulation of CP mRNA levels in rat hepatoma cells.
