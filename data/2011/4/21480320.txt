Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major etiologic factor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis, involving effects of chronic liver inflammation and of the weakly oncogenic HBV X protein (pX). pX-mediated hepatocyte transformation requires Polo-like kinase1 (Plk1) activity, but the mechanism is not fully understood. We identified by a genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library screen the genes zinc finger, MYM-type 2 (ZNF198) and suppressor of zeste 12 homolog (Drosophila) (SUZ12) whose protein depletion rescues pX-expressing cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis. ZNF198 and SUZ12 are components of chromatin remodeling complexes and associate with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. Knockdown of ZNF198 and SUZ12 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced p53 stability and DNA repair, rescued pX-expressing hepatocytes from DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and increased pX-induced polyploidy and oncogenic transformation, suggesting ZNF198 and SUZ12 have a role in pX-mediated transformation. Interestingly, during pX-mediated transformation the protein but not messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of ZNF198 and SUZ12 progressively decreased, whereas Plk1 levels increased. Inhibition of Plk1 activity restored protein levels of ZNF198 and SUZ12. In addition, transfected Polo-box-domain (PBD) of Plk1 coimmunoprecipitated with ZNF198 and SUZ12, suggesting that these proteins are Plk1 substrates. Elevated Plk1 and reduced protein levels of ZNF198 and SUZ12 were also observed in human liver cancer cell lines derived from HBV-related tumors and in the presence of HBV replication. Importantly, knockdown by siRNA of ZNF198 and SUZ12 enhanced HBV replication.Conclusion:Reduced protein levels of ZNF198 and SUZ12 and elevated Plk1 occur during pX-mediated hepatocyte transformation in human liver cancer cell lines, as well as during HBV replication, underscoring the significance of these genes both in HBV-mediated HCC pathogenesis and HBV replication. We propose Plk1 activity down-regulates ZNF198 and SUZ12, thereby enhancing both HBV replication and pX-mediated oncogenic transformation.
