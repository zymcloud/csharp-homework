Aim:To elucidate gender differences and the influence of obesity and/or metabolic syndrome-related fatty liver on alcoholic liver disease (ALD), we analyzed characteristic features of ALD.Methods:We investigated 266 ALD patients (224 males and 42 females) without hepatocellular carcinoma stratified by gender and the presence of cirrhosis. Male and female patients matched for age and total ethanol intake were also analyzed. A diagnosis of ALD was based on alcohol intake (>70 g daily for more than 5 years), clinical features, and exclusion of other liver diseases. The prevalence of obesity, lifestyle-related diseases, and psychological disorders were assessed.Results:The prevalence of psychological disorders showed a significant gender difference among all ALD patients (12% in males versus 43% in females, P Conclusions:Obesity was not common in cirrhotic ALD. Psychological disorders seem to be important for female ALD.
