Ethno pharmacological relevance:The plant Sesbania grandiflora (Fabaceae) is commonly known as "Sesbania" and "agathi" in ayurvedic system of medicine and reputed in the indigenous medicine in India. It is also known as "Agati Sesban" or "humming bird tree" in English. All parts of this unique plant are useful and have a wide spectrum of medicinal properties. The plant has various uses in folk and traditional medicines for headache, swellings, anemia, bronchitis, pains, liver disorders and tumors.Aim of the study:The objective of the present study was to explore the anticancer activity of the ethanol extract of Sesbania grandiflora against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)-bearing Swiss albino mice.Materials and methods:Anticancer activity of ethanol extract of Sesbania grandiflora (EESG) of both leaves and flowers were evaluated in Swiss albino mice against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cell line at the doses of 100 and 200mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally. The extracts were administered for 14 consecutive days. Twenty-four hours of last dose and 18 h of fasting, the mice were sacrificed and the anticancer effect of EESG was assessed by evaluating tumor volume, viable and nonviable tumor cell count, tumor weight, hematological parameters and biochemical parameters of EAC bearing host.Results:Sesbania grandiflora extracts showed significant decrease in (p<0.01) tumor volume, viable cell count, tumor weight and elevated the life span of EAC bearing mice. Hematological profile such as RBC, hemoglobin and lymphocyte count reverted to normal level in EESG treated mice. The extracts significantly (p<0.05) decreased the levels of lipid peroxidation and significantly (p<0.05) increased the levels of GSH, SOD and CAT.Conclusion:The results showed that the ethanol extract of Sesbania grandiflora was effective in inhibiting the tumor growth in ascitic models and that is comparable to 5-Fluorouracil.
