Objectives:Costimulatory signals are essential for T-cell activation and hence play a very important role in antitumor immunity. B7 and 4-1BBL which belongs to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family provide costimulatory interaction for T-cell activation and function. This study investigated the role of B7 and 4-1BBL in the amplification of tumor immunity by transduction of the B7-1, B7-2 and 4-1BBL into mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cell line H22.Methods:The tumorigenicity of H22 variants expressing either B7-1, B7-2 (H22/B7-1/B7-2) or 4-1BBL was compared with an H22 variant expressing B7-1, B7-2 and 4-1BBL (H22/B7-1/B7-2/4-1BBL). The study next investigated whether the combination of B7-1/B7-2 and 4-1BBL cell injection induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response and IL-2/IFN-γ secretion. The immune mechanisms underlying this combination treatment were then analyzed.Results:Syngeneic BALB/c mice injected with H22/B7-1/B7-2/4-1BBL cells that expressed elevated levels of B7-1, B7-2 and 4-1BBL showed a tumor development frequency of 50% compared with 100% in mice injected with the H22 parental line, H22/neo, H22/B7-1/B7-2 and H22/4-1BBL. Mice inoculated with H22 tumor cells expressing B7-1, B7-2 and 4-1BBL developed a strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and long-term immunity against wild-type tumor, suggesting a synergistic effect between the B7 and 4-1BBL costimulatory pathways. Results showed that H22/B7-1/B7-2/4-1BBL tumor vaccines probably protect the infiltrating lymphocytes from apoptosis and induce NF-κB activation to improve T-cell-mediated antitumor response.Conclusions:In this study, the antitumor consequences of using B7-1, B7-2 and 4-1BBL gene transfer have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of gene therapy approach for hepatocellular carcinoma.
