Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and particularly nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not only risk factors for liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but are also strongly associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. This is probably due to the fact that the same mechanisms are operative in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In addition fatty liver predicts incident type 2 diabetes, but also atherosclerosis, indicating a causal role of fatty liver in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This hypothesis is supported by novel findings deriving from translational research involving precise genotyping and phenotyping strategies in humans. The precise investigation of mechanisms involved will deliver new knowledge which may be important for the prevention and therapy of these diseases.
