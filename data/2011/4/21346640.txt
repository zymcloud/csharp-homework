Treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma is very challenging because the tumor commonly spreads to the liver, surgical resection of metastases is rarely possible, and there is no standard effective systemic therapy. We report the case of a 38-year-old man, who presented with metastatic involvement of the left ventricle as the first site of uveal melanoma recurrence 13 years after treatment of his primary tumor. The metastatic tumor was considered unresectable. We describe the patient's medical management over the next 3 years, the course of his disease, and the results of our review of the literature.
