Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is proposed to be involved in both tumor cell invasion and metastasis. MMP-1 proteolytically activates protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), which also plays an important role in tumor development and progression. However, it is currently unknown whether MMP-1 activation of PAR-1 has relevance to the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To address this problem, we investigate the clinicopathological and prognostic value of MMP-1/PAR-1 signaling axis in HCC. Immunohistochemistry assay was used to determine the expression of MMP-1 and PAR-1 proteins in normal and HCC tissues. The correlations of MMP-1 and PAR-1 expression with clinicopathological parameters were assessed by Chi-squared test. Patient survival and their differences were determined by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox regression was adopted for multivariate analysis of prognostic factors. MMP-1 and PAR-1 immunoreactivities were negative or low in normal liver tissues, but high in HCC tissues. PAR-1 expression was significantly correlated with that of MMP-1 (r = 0.896, p
