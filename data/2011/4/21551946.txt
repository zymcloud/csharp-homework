We examined age-related changes in the protein expression of carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) in livers of Long-Evans with a cinnamon-like color (LEC) rats using an agouti color (LEA) rats as controls. The levels of the protein of CAIII in the liver of LEC male rats increased before 20 weeks of age, at the stage of acute hepatitis, and were decreased at 54 weeks of age, while those of CAIII in the liver of LEA male rats were highly expressed at all ages. In the normal LEA rats, CAIII showed sexual dimorphism. The level of CAIII in LEA male rat liver relative to female was four times higher. On the other hand, young LEC rat (at 4-12 weeks) showed a higher protein level of CAIII than LEA rats, and then decreased during development of hepatitis. CAIII mRNA also decreased in the LEC rat liver during hepatocarcinogenesis. The level of CAIII in the tumor region was lower than that in the tumor-free region. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that glutathione S-transferase P (GST-P) was positive and CAIII was negative in the precancerous region. The expression of CAIII was suppressed in cancerous lesions in hepatoma-bearing LEC rat liver compared to uninvolved surrounding tissues. These results indicated that suppression of CAIII accompanied hepatocarcinogenesis and it is a secondary consequence of the high copper levels in the liver.
