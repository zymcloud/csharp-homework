Objectives:We sought to evaluate our transplant series in light of the parameters outlined in the quality criteria established by the Spanish Hepatic Transplant Society (Sociedad Española de Trasplante Hepático [SETH]).Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 240 hepatic transplantations performed in 223 patients from November 2001 to December 2009.Results:Among the series, 57% were in Child class C, 50% had cirrhosis without hepatocellular carcinoma, and 32% had this neoplasm. The most common cause for the illness was alcohol, followed by a virus, namely hepatitis C virus in 76% of cases. The average waiting list time was 45.14 days. The total graft ischemia averaged 460 minutes (range, 265-937). The 4.1% (n = 10), incidence of an urgent retransplantation was mainly due to primary graft failure or arterial thrombosis. During the perioperative period the mortality rate was 2.5% (n = 6) and the 1-month mortality rate was 6.6% (n = 16). The raw survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years after the operation are 85%, 78%, and 72%, respectively.Conclusion:Our perioperative as well as the long-term results fall within the quality standards established by SETH.
