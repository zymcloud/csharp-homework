Objective:To evaluate the feasibility of sequential liver resection or liver transplantation following downstaging of larger hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A retrospective study was conducted. And a total of 58 patients with unresectable larger HCC (diameter > 5 cm) from June 2006 to March 2010 underwent TACE. According the outcomes of TACE, they received liver transplantation (LT, n = 36) and liver resection (LR, n = 22) respectively. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The multivariate analyses for the influencing factors were evaluated by the Cox proportional hazard model.Results:The median follow-up period of 58 cases was 22 months and the median survival time 23.57 ± 1.54 months. The 1-, 2-, 3-year OS and RFS rates after LT was 94%, 84% & 73% and 88%, 75% & 64% respectively. The median recurrence time was 12.3 ± 6.4 months (range: 3 - 23). Twenty-eight patients had adequate downstaging to qualify for LT under the Milan criteria. The 1-, 2-, 3-year OS and RFS of the downstaging group was better than those of the non-downstaging group (OS: 96%, 88%, 75% vs 92%, 48%, 48% P = 0.067; RFS: 95%, 95%, 79% vs 76%, 40%, 40% P = 0.002). The 1-, 2-, 3-years OS and RFS after LR was 100%, 64% & 52% and 72%, 49% & 49% respectively. The median recurrence time was 9.3 ± 4.5 months (range: 3 - 23). The long-term results of LT group following TACE were better than those of LR group (OS, P = 0.178; RFS, P = 0.139). The multivariate analyses showed that only pathologic total tumor diameter > 7 cm (P = 0.002, RR = 6.578), microvascular invasion (P = 0.001, RR = 5.737) and poor differentiation (P = 0.048, RR = 4.335) were significantly correlated with tumor recurrence.Conclusion:Sequential liver resection and liver transplantation after downstaging by TACE are feasible for some larger HCCs. And the long-term prognosis is satisfactory.
