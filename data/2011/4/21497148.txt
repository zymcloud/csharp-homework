Squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder is rare, accounting for only 0.5-12.7% of all malignant gallbladder tumors. Tumor progression is rapid but silent and therefore usually discovered at an advanced stage, hence its poor prognosis. We report the observation of a 69-year-old woman with known cholelithiasis, admitted for biliary colic. CT scan highlighted a thick-walled gallbladder harboring a tumor invading segments IV and V of the liver. The patient underwent cholecystectomy associated with bisegmental hepatic resection. Pathology showed a well-differentiated, keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, infiltrating the entire gallbladder wall and the adjacent hepatic parenchyma.
