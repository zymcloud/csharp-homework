Impaired insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) is a common denominator in many metabolic disorders, exerting pleiotropic effects on skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue function. Heme oxygenase-1 (HOX-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme catabolism, has recently been shown to confer an antidiabetic effect while regulating cellular redox-buffering capacity. Therefore, in the present study, we probed into the mechanisms underlying the effect of insulin on HOX-1 in C2 skeletal myoblasts. Hence, insulin was found to suppress C2 myoblasts viability via stimulation of oxidative stress, with HOX-1 counteracting this action. Insulin induced HOX-1 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner, an effect attenuated by selective inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059), Src (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine), and c-Jun terminal kinases 1 and 2 (SP600125) pathways. Furthermore, nuclear factor-κB role in insulin-induced HOX-1 up-regulation was verified, with ERK1/2, Src, and c-Jun terminal kinases 1 and 2 mediating p65-nuclear factor-κB subunit phosphorylation. Overall, our novel findings highlight for the first time the transduction mechanisms mediating HOX-1 induction in insulin-treated C2 myoblasts. This effect was established to be cell type specific because insulin failed to promote HOX-1 expression in HepG2 hepatoma cells. Deciphering the signaling networks involved in insulin-stimulated HOX-1 up-regulation is of prominent significance because it may potentially contribute to elucidation of the mechanisms involved in associated metabolic pathologies.
