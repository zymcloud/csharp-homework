Intracellular trafficking of tRNA was long thought to be a one-way trip from the site of biogenesis in the nucleus to the translation machinery in the cytoplasm. This view has recently been challenged, however, by the discovery that tRNA can move retrograde from the cytoplasm back to the nucleus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and rat hepatoma H4IIE cells during nutrient stress and in S. cerevisiae after intron-containing pre-tRNAs are spliced in the cytoplasm. Contrary to studies reported, we present data suggesting that nutrient stress does not cause retrograde transport of cytoplasmic tRNAs to the nucleus in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells, human HeLa and HEK293 cells, and the yeasts Kluyveromyces lactis and S. cerevisiae. However, the efficiency of nuclear re-export of retrograded spliced tRNA was severely affected in S. cerevisiae and two other Saccharomyces species deprived of nutrient. Collectively, the data suggest that nutrient stress does not cause nuclear import of cytoplasmic tRNA; instead, nutrient stress specifically regulates nuclear re-export of retrograded spliced tRNAs but not nuclear export of tRNAs made from intronless pre-tRNAs in Saccharomyces species. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that Mtr10p and the Gsp1pGTP/Gsp1pGDP cycle are not involved in nuclear tRNA import in S. cerevisiae during nutrient stress.
