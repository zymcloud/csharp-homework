Objective:To assess contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings and serial changes of the treated area at follow-up in patients who underwent liver resection using a bipolar radiofrequency electrosurgical device.Methods:Imaging findings of 27 patients with resected hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (n=24) and metastases (n=3) (mean size: 2.6cm), were retrospectively evaluated. Two readers assessed: the (a) presence, (b) thickness, (c) shape and (d) echogenicity (CEUS)/attenuation (CT)/signal intensity (MR imaging) at coagulated site and the (e) presence of residual tumor of the bipolar radiofrequency electrosurgical device resection margin.Results:Follow-up was performed with either CT (n=20) or MR imaging (n=7) and repeated in 16 patients with CT (n=7), MR imaging (n=4), or both techniques (n=5). Four patients also had a single CEUS examination. At first imaging follow-up a peripheral halo was depicted at resection site (100%). A fluid collection within the surgical area was found in 67% of patients. During the following imaging examinations a progressive involution of both findings was observed, respectively, in 81% and 62% of patients. Viable tissue was detected in three patients (11%).Conclusions:After liver resection with bipolar radiofrequency electrosurgical device successfully ablated tumor is demonstrated at imaging by an unenhancing partial linear peripheral halo, in most cases, surrounding a fluid collection reducing in size during follow-up.
