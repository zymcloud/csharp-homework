Chronic hepatitis B is a worldwide public health challenge. Knowledge of natural history of chronic hepatitis B is important for the management of the disease. A community-based prospective cohort study was carried out to evaluate the risk predictors of progression of chronic hepatitis B in Taiwan. A total of 23,820 participants were enrolled in 1991-1992 from seven townships in Taiwan. Their serum samples were collected at study entry and tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and e antigen (HBeAg), antibodies against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP). A subcohort of 3653 male and female participants who were seropositive for HBsAg and seronegative for anti-HCV was included in the Risk Evaluation of Viral Load Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer-Hepatitis B Virus (REVEAL-HBV) study. Newly developed cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were ascertained through follow-up examination and data linkage with profiles of the National Cancer Registry, National Health Insurance Database and Death Certification System. The incidence of both HCC and cirrhosis were significantly associated with serum HBV DNA levels in a dose-response relationship from
