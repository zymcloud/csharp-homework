A new D:B-friedoolean-type triterpene, 3Î²-acetoxyglutin-5(10)-en-6-oxo (1), together with seventeen known compounds (2-18) was isolated from the roots of Scorzonera austriaca. Their structures were elucidated mainly by NMR and HR-ESI-MS, as well as on comparison with the reported data. Cytotoxicities of compounds 2, 4, 6, 10-14 and 16 against selected cancer cells of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and human hepatoma (BEL-7404) were measured in vitro.
