Introduction:The purpose of this study was to explore the potential risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after curative resection of primary HCC.Methods:This was a hospital-based retrospective cohort study. The authors analyzed the medical records of all the subjects with HCC initially treated by hepatic resection at a medical center in Taiwan from 1995 to 2006. In all, 222 subjects were enrolled in this study. The total observational period was 3 years.Results:There were 172 men (77.5%) and 50 women (22.5%). The mean age was 57.0 ± 13.7 years (range, 15-79 years). Among 222 subjects, the overall recurrence rates were 28.8% (64/222), 42.3% (94/222) and 47.7% (106/222) at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis exhibited that tumor size ≥ 5 cm [odds ratio (OR) = 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27-4.17], liver cirrhosis (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.18-3.79) and preoperative aspartate aminotransferase level ≥ 34 IU/L (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.01-4.04) were independent risk factors of HCC recurrence.Conclusion:Patients who have larger tumor size, liver cirrhosis and higher preoperative aspartate aminotransferase level should be carefully followed up because they are at high risk of HCC recurrence postoperatively.
