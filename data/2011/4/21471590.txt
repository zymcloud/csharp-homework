Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and toxicities of stereotactic radiotherapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.Design:Retrospective study.Setting:Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong.Main outcome measures:Treatment outcome and toxicities.Patients:During the period of 2000 to 2004, 16 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with stereotactic radiotherapy were reviewed.Results:Of the 16 patients, 11 had assessable responses. For local control, there were two complete and three partial responses, five with stable disease and one with progressive disease, giving a local response rate of 45% and control rate of 91%. The median survival was 23 months. The 1-year and 3-year overall survival rates were 62% and 28%, respectively. The most frequent site of recurrence was intrahepatic but outside the irradiated field. Two patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis developed radiation-induced liver disease. No other grade 3/4 toxicities were recorded.Conclusion:Stereotactic radiotherapy gives high local control rates and has the potential to prolong survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. It is safe and tolerable in Child-Pugh A patients.
