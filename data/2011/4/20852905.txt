The long-term outcomes of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) administration in patients undergoing hepatic resection remain unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of oral supplementation with BCAA-enriched nutrients on postoperative quality of life (QOL) in patients undergoing liver resection. A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in 96 patients undergoing hepatic resection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive BCAA supplementation (AEN group, n = 48) or a conventional diet (control group, n = 48). Postoperative QOL and short-term outcomes were regularly and continuously evaluated in all patients using a short-form 36 (SF-36) health questionnaire and by measuring various clinical parameters. This study demonstrated a significant improvement in QOL after hepatectomy for liver neoplasm in the AEN group based on the same patients' preoperative SF-36 scores (P NCT00945568).
