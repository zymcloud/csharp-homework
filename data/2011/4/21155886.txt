Background and aim:Repeat hepatic resection for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is effective in improving long-term outcome in selected patients. In the present study, we attempted to identify the prognostic factors influencing overall and recurrence-free survival after the second hepatic resection.Methods:From 1 September 1997 to 30 September 2009, 329 consecutive patients with HCC underwent surgical exploration at Yamanashi University Hospital, Japan. Of these, 35 patients underwent curative, second hepatic resection. The survival results in the 35 patients were analyzed retrospectively, and prognostic factors were determined.Results:The univariate analysis revealed that Child-Pugh B, a Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of α-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) value more than 15%, and multiple tumors, were associated with significantly worse overall survival (P=0.010, P=0.0003, and P=0.037, respectively) and only AFP-L3 >15% was associated with significantly worse recurrence-free survival after the second hepatic resection (P=0.008). By multivariate analysis, only AFP-L3 >15% was an independent predictor of adverse overall survival. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates after the second hepatic resection of 27 HCC patients with low AFP-L3 (≤15%) were 100%, 100%, and 91.7%, respectively, whereas the corresponding survival rates of eight HCC patients with high AFP-L3 (>15%) were 100%, 47.6%, and 23.8%, respectively.Conclusions:The preoperative AFP-L3 level was a useful prognostic biomarker for survival after repeat hepatic resection.
