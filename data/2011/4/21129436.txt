Previously, we have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells could be differentiated into steroidogenic cells through steroidogenic factor-1 and 8bromo-cAMP treatment. Use of liver receptor homolog-1, another of the nuclear receptor 5A family nuclear receptors, with 8bromo-cAMP also resulted in the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into steroid hormone-producing cells. The same approaches could not be applied to other undifferentiated cells such as embryonic stem cells or embryonal carcinoma cells, because the over-expression of the nuclear receptor 5A family is cytotoxic to these cells. We established embryonic stem cells carrying tetracycline-regulated steroidogenic factor-1 gene at the ROSA26 locus. The embryonic stem cells were first differentiated into a mesenchymal cell lineage by culturing on collagen IV-coated dishes and treating with pulse exposures of retinoic acid before expression of steroidogenic factor-1. Although the untreated embryonic stem cells could not be converted into steroidogenic cells by expression of steroidogenic factor-1 in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor due to inability of the cells to survive, the differentiated cells could be successfully converted into steroidogenic cells when expression of steroidogenic factor-1 was induced. They exhibited characteristics of adrenocortical-like cells and produced a large amount of corticosterone. These results indicated that pluripotent stem cells could be differentiated into steroidogenic cells by the nuclear receptor 5A family of protein via the mesenchymal cell lineage. This approach may provide a source of cells for future gene therapy for diseases caused by steroidogenesis deficiencies.
