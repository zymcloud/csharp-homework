Objective:To investigate the relationship between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence and hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence.Methods:The clinical data of 340 patients underwent liver transplantation due to HBV related end-stage liver disease and received long-term follow up in our hospital from Jan 2004 to Dec 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received nucleoside analogues therapy formally before entering into the waiting list and nucleoside analogues combined low-dose HBIG therapy during and after transplantation. Patients were regularly followed up at the outpatient, monitoring the HBV recurrence and survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors for hepatitis recurrence.Results:33 patients suffered from HBV recurrence post transplantation. The 1-, 3- and 5- year recurrence rates were 7.0%, 10% and 13% respectively. The median HBV recurrence time was 5 months (1-21 months). COX regression analysis revealed that risk factors for HBV recurrence were HCC (HR = 2.98; 95% CI 1.08-8.25; P Conclusions:Post transplantation HCC recurrence is a risk factor for HBV recurrence.
