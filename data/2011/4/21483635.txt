Aim:To evaluate the benefit and effectiveness of MR-arterioportography (MR-AP) to achieve the highest sensitivity for detection and evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Twenty liver cirrhosis patients with suspected HCC were included before transarterial chemoembolization. In all patients double-enhanced Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. A bolus of 10 mL MagnevistÂ® was injected through a selectively placed catheter in the superior mesenteric artery and MRI of the liver was performed in arterioportographic phase. Two independent readers evaluated number, size and localization of detected lesions. Diagnostic quality was determined using a 4-point scale. Differences were analyzed for significance using a t-test. Interobserver variability was calculated.Results:In all 20 patients (100%), MR-AP was feasible. Diagnostic quality was, in all cases, between 1 and 2 for both modalities and readers. MR-AP detected significantly more lesions than double-enhanced MRI (102.5 vs. 61, respectively, P Conclusion:Our study confirmed that the MR-AP as an additional modality for detection of HCC is beneficial, as significantly more lesions were detected compared to MRI with liver-specific contrast.
