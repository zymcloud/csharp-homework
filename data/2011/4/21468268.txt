Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is an alternative to open heart surgery in high risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. High mortality and complications related to cardiopulmonary bypass for conventional open heart surgery can be avoided with this new less invasive technique. In case of concomitant severe arterial disease, the transapical approach is recommended rather than transfemoral access. An 80-yr-old man with symptomatic aortic stenosis and who had very high surgical risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, a history of stroke, bronchial asthma including poor pulmonary function and hepatocellular carcinoma was treated with a transapical aortic valve replacement. The expected mortality in this patient was 25.4% by Euroscore if we performed the conventional aortic valve surgery. The patient was discharged and was well at the 45 follow-up days. We report the first case of successful transcatheter transapical aortic valve implantation which is available recently in Korea.
