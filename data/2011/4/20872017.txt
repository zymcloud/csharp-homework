Background:Although recent technological developments and improved endoscopic procedures have further spread the application of laparoscopic liver resection, laparoscopic anatomical liver resection still presents major technical difficulties, such as pedicle control.Methods:Subjects comprised 27 patients who underwent laparoscopic anatomical liver resection using an extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle transaction between August 2005 and February 2010.Results:A total of 61 Glissonean pedicles could be encircled en bloc extrahepatically, as planned. No serious complications, including major bleeding or injury of the portal triad, were encountered during procedures.Conclusions:Extrahepatic Glissonean access seems to be feasible and safe for laparoscopic anatomical resection of the liver.
