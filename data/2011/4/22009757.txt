Background:Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a powerful, multifaceted modifier of carcinogenesis. However, the clinical significance and biologic function of HSF1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown.Methods:Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect expression levels of HSF1, and its correlation with clinicopathologic parameters and the prognosis for patients with HCC were analyzed. In addition, the biologic function and molecular mechanisms of HSF1 in HCC were investigated in vitro and in vivo.Results:HSF1 levels were elevated predominantly in HCC, especially in venous emboli from HCC (P Conclusions:Collectively, the current findings suggested that HSF1 may serve as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC.
