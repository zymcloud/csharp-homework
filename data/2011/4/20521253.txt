To investigate the association between the potentially functional polymorphisms in IL12A and IL12B, HBV infection and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in a Chinese population, we genotyped three polymorphisms, rs568408 (3'UTR G>A), rs2243115 (5'UTR T>G) in IL12A and rs3212227 (3'UTR A>C) in IL12B in a case-control study of 869 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases and 891 cancer-free controls. We found that the IL12A rs568408 GA/AA variant genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of HCC (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17-2.00), compared with the wild-type GG homozygote. In the stratified analyses, the increased risk of HCC associated with rs568408 GA/AA was more evident in patients who were negative for HBsAg (adjusted OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.23-2.39). However, no significant associations between IL12A rs2243115 T/G, IL12B rs3212227 A/C and risk of HCC were observed. Our findings indicate that IL12A rs568408 may contribute to the risk of HCC and modify HCC risk associated with HBV infection.
