Aflatoxins and fumonisins are ubiquitous foodborne toxicants and the co-occurrence of these mycotoxins in human foods represents a significant public health concern, which has been strongly associated with human aflatoxicosis, neural tube defects, as well as many types of primary cancers. In this study the co-contamination of aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) and fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) in food and human dietary exposure was investigated in residents of three different areas of China. A total of 209 food samples were measured for AFB(1) and FB(1). The median AFB(1) levels were 13.5, 2.3 and 1.3 µg kg(-1) and the median FB(1) levels were 2.6, 0.4 and 0.3 mg kg(-1) in corn samples collected from Huaian (a high-risk area for oesophageal cancer), Fusui (a high-risk area for liver cancer) and Huantai (a low-risk area for both oesophageal and liver cancers), respectively. The median level of AFB(1) in plant oil of Fusui was the highest (52.3 µg kg(-1)) among all food samples analysed. Co-contamination of these two mycotoxins was found in corn, rice and wheat flour. Based on measured food consumption data, the averaged daily dietary intake of AFB(1) was 0.397 µg (range = 0.269-1.218 µg) in residents of Huantai, 1.723 µg (0.224-49.772 µg) in Huaian, and 2.685 µg (1.006-14.534 µg) in Fusui. The averaged FB(1) daily dietary intake was 92.4 µg (range = 55.0-362.1 µg) for residents of Huantai, 460.0 µg (83.2-2894.5 µg) in Huaian, and 138.6 µg (30.0-10,541.6 µg) in Fusui. These data suggest that the co-exposure to AFB(1) and FB(1) in residents of rural China may contribute to the aetiology of human chronic diseases in high-risk areas.
