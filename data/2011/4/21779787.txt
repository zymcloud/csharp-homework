Circulating DNA is a potential biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. This study was aimed to quantify the circulating DNA in plasma from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using quantitative PCR and evaluate its potential clinical value. Blood samples were collected from 72 patients with HCC, 37 with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis and 41 healthy volunteers. Plasma DNA was extracted and quantified by a real-time quantitative PCR method. The diagnostic and prognostic value of plasma DNA analysis for HCC was evaluated. DNA levels in the HCC plasma (median: 173 ng/mL) were significantly higher than those in the healthy controls (9 ng/mL) or control benign patients (46 ng/mL) (P
