Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an established alternative treatment to surgery and intra-arterial chemotherapy, usually performed under contrast-enhanced CT scan guidance. We describe our experience with the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and contrast dynamics analysis for planning and monitoring RFA in a patient with HCC.
