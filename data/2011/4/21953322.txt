High-mobility group box 1(HMGB1) has been associated with many human cancers, but the role of HMGB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of HMGB1 in human HCC with regard to its clinical significance. Twelve cases of normal liver tissues, 34 cases of HCC and the corresponding liver tissue just around the tumor (LAT) were collected. Then, all the samples were subjected to clinicopathologic examination, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western-blot (WB) and immunohistochemical analysis for the expression of HMGB1. The relationships between HMGB1 mRNA expression and clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed. RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of relative HMGB1 mRNA (HMGB1/GAPDH) was 0.854 ± 0.172; the highest in the tissue of HCC, significantly up-regulated compared with that of 0.527 ± 0.155 in LAT and of 0.405 ± 0.087 in normal liver tissues (P
