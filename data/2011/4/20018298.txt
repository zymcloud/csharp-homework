Background:An ELR+ CXC chemokine receptor, CXCR2, was recently reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and development. However, the role of CXCR2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between CXCR2 expression and the biocharacteristics of HCC, and determine whether the expression of CXCR2 was related to the tumorigenesis and progression.Methods:Forty-two patients who underwent hepatic resection and were diagnosed as HCC by histologic examination were included. HCC and corresponding adjacent tissues (distance from the tumor border exceeding 2 cm) were obtained. Twenty-three samples of normal liver tissue were acquired surgically from the patients who had received an operation due to liver trauma. CXCR2 mRNA and protein expressions were examined using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot.Results:Expression levels of CXCR2 were significantly increased in HCC compared with adjacent and normal liver tissues (P Conclusion:Our data revealed that CXCR2 was able to promote invasion and metastasis of HCC. It may be a useful marker for judging biocharacteristics and prognosis of HCC.
