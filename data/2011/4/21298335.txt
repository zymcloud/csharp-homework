Little is known about the benefits of preoperative staging chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with asymptomatic breast cancer. We therefore investigated the clinical value of preoperative chest CT in detecting lung and liver metastases by retrospectively reviewing the records of 1,703 patients who underwent preoperative chest CT in a single institution between January 2006 and June 2009. Abnormal CT findings, including suspected metastases and indeterminate nodules in the lung or liver, were found in 266 patients (15.6%). Among these, 26 patients (1.5% of all patients and 9.8% of patients with abnormal CT findings) had true metastases, including 17 in the lungs, 3 in the liver, and 6 in both. True metastases were detected in 1 (0.2%), 0 (0%), and 24 (6.0%) patients with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of chest CT were 100, 89.1, and 11.3%, respectively, for lung metastasis and 100, 97.6, and 18.4%, respectively, for liver metastasis. All true metastatic lung lesions were all small-sized nodules, ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 cm in largest diameter, and could not be detected on chest X-rays. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the lack of usefulness of routine preoperative chest CT in detecting asymptomatic liver and lung metastasis in patients with early breast cancer. Chest CT, however, upstaged 6.0% of stage III patients to stage IV.
