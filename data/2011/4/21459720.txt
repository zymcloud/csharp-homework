Background:The number of loco-regional therapies (LRTs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased dramatically during the past decade. Many patients with HCC who were beyond the Milan criteria were allowed to receive a liver transplantation (LT) once the HCC was successfully down-staged. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the outcomes of LRTs prior to LT in patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria.Methods:We analyzed 56 patients treated from June 2006 to March 2010: 22 met the Milan criteria (T1+T2, 39.3%), 16 had T3 tumors (28.6%), and 11 had T4a tumors (19.6%), while 7 were suspected of tumor vascular invasion (T4b, 12.5%). All patients underwent preoperative LRTs, including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, liver resection, and/or microwave coagulation therapy. The number of the patients who were successfully down-staged before LT, the types of LRTs used before LT, and their outcomes after LT were recorded.Results:Eleven patients had necrotic tumors (pT0, 19.6%); 6 had pT1 tumors (10.7%), 22 had pT2 tumors (39.3%), 6 had pT3 tumors (10.7%), 5 had pT4a tumors (8.9%), and 6 had pT4b tumors (10.7%). The histopathologic tumors of 39 patients (69.6%) were down-staged and met the established Milan criteria (pT0-2). Imaging-proven under-staging was present in 5 HCC patients (8.9%) who had tumors involving the intrahepatic venous system. Twenty-three patients (41.1%) had stable HCC and 10 (17.9%) died. The 1-, 3- and 4-year survival rates were 96%, 73% and 61%, respectively, with a mean survival time of 22.29+/-1.63 months. Six patients died of tumor recurrence. The 1-, 3- and 4-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 88%, 75% and 66%, respectively. The 3-year RFS of patients with pT0-2 tumors was 82%, which was markedly greater than that of patients with pT3 tumors (63%, P=0.018) or pT4 tumors (17%, P=0.000). Although the 3-year RFS of patients with pT3 tumors was greater than that of patients with pT4 tumors, the difference was not significant.Conclusions:Successful down-staging of HCCs can be achieved in the majority of carefully selected patients by LRTs. Importantly, patients who are successfully down-staged and undergo LT may have a higher RFS rate.
