The glucose transporter isoform 1 (GLUT1) is a key rate-limiting factor in the transport and metabolism of glucose in cancer cells. Recently, we found that GLUT1 expression is increased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and promotes tumorigenicity of HCC cells. Hypoxia further increased GLUT1 expression in HCC cells, and this induction was dependent on the activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha. The promoter region of the GLUT1 gene harbors a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; Rs710218; A to T at -2841) closely positioned to a putative HIF-1alpha binding site, and recently, this SNP was found to be more frequent in patients with renal cell carcinoma. In the present study, the A-2841T genotype distribution did not differ significantly between HCC patients (n = 95; AA: 60%; AT 36% and TT: 4%) and healthy controls (n = 127; AA: 50%; AT 41% and TT: 9%). However and noteworthy, non-carriers of the T allele had higher GLUT1 expression levels in cancerous hepatic tissue, and tended to reveal a more aggressive tumour growth. These data indicate that the SNP Rs710218 is not associated with a higher risk for HCC but rather for HCC progression, potentially via HIF-1alpha mediated increased GLUT1 expression.
