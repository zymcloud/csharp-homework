Background:Particle radiotherapy is a novel treatment for malignant tumours. The present study aimed to evaluate risk factors for overall survival and local control after particle radiotherapy of single small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to identify suitable candidates for this treatment.Methods:All patients with a single HCC smaller than 5 cm in diameter treated by particle radiotherapy between 2001 and 2008 were identified retrospectively from a prospectively collected database. Clinical outcomes and prognostic factors were analysed.Results:A total of 150 patients were included. Five-year overall survival and local control rates were 50.9 and 92.3 per cent respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that several factors, including age and Child-Pugh classification, significantly influenced overall survival. Proximity to the digestive tract and Child-Pugh classification were independent risk factors for local recurrence. Other tumour factors including size, gross classification, previous treatment, macroscopic vascular invasion, and tumour location in relation to the diaphragm and large vessels did not influence local control rate.Conclusion:Particle radiotherapy seems safe and effective, and may be a novel treatment for small HCC. Recurrences are more frequent when the tumour is located close to the gut.
