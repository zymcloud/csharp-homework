Purpose:To compare the survival outcomes between hepatic resection and transarterial lipiodol chemoembolization (TACE) used as the initial treatment in patients with large (â‰¥5 cm), multiple, and resectable hepatocellular carcinomas.Materials and methods:This study had local ethical committee approval; all patients gave written informed consent. Between January 2004 and December 2006, 168 consecutive patients were prospectively studied. As an initial treatment, 85 patients underwent hepatic resection and 83 underwent TACE. Of the 29 of 83 patients in whom there was a good response to TACE, 13 underwent subsequent hepatic resection. The remaining 16 patients, who refused hepatic resection, underwent TACE and local ablation. Repeated TACE was performed in patients with stable disease or progressive disease after initial TACE. The differences in survival between groups and subgroups were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to clarify the prognostic factors for survival.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates for the initial hepatic resection group and the initial TACE group were 70.6%, 35.3%, 23.9% and 67.2%, 26.0%, 18.9%, respectively (P = .26). Complication rates were significantly higher in the initial hepatic resection group than in the initial TACE group (P Conclusion:TACE might be a better initial treatment in patients with large, multiple, and resectable hepatocellular carcinomas; hepatic resection should be recommended to patients who respond well to TACE.
