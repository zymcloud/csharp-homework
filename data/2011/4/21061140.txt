Background:Resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is potentially curative; however, recurrence is common. To date, few or no effective adjuvant therapies have been adequately investigated. This study evaluates the efficacy of adjuvant iodine-131-lipiodol after hepatic resection through the experience of a single-center hepatobiliary service of managing this disease.Patients and methods:All patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC and received adjuvant iodine-131-lipiodol between January 1991 and August 2009 were selected for inclusion into the experimental group. A group composed of patients treated during the same time period without adjuvant iodine-131-lipiodol was identified through the unit's HCC surgery database for comparison. The endpoints of this study were disease-free survival and overall survival.Results:Forty-one patients who received adjuvant iodine-131-lipiodol after hepatic resection were compared with a matched group of 41 patients who underwent hepatic resection only. The median disease-free and overall survival were 24 versus 10 months (P = 0.032) and 104 versus 19 months (P = 0.001) in the experimental and control groups, respectively. Rates of intrahepatic-only recurrences (73 vs. 37%; P = 0.02) and surgical and nonsurgical treatments for recurrences (84 vs. 56%; P = 0.04) were higher in the experimental group compared to the control group.Conclusion:The finding of this study corroborates the current evidence from randomized and nonrandomized trials that adjuvant iodine-131-lipiodol improves disease-free and overall survival in patients with HCC after hepatic resection. The lengthened disease-free survival after adjuvant iodine-131-lipiodol allows for further disease-modifying treatments to improve the overall survival.
