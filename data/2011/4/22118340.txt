Background:Recent studies have focused on regulatory T cells (Tregs) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and they were also conducted independently of each other.Aims:This study tried to characterize Tregs in blood and tumour infiltration, and to explore the correlations between Tregs and the context of chronic hepatitis B in HCC patients.Methods:The liver-resident Tregs and CD8(+) T cells on core biopsy were investigated using immunohistochemistry staining in individuals (n = 209) with CHB (n = 47), HCC (n = 137) or healthy controls (n = 25). Circulating Tregs were detected in the above patients with CHB (n = 27) or HCC (n = 101) by flow cytometry.Results:The number of tumour-infiltrating and circulating FoxP3(+) Tregs was significantly high in patients with CHB (P Conclusions:Increased Foxp3(+) Tregs may represent a prognostic predictor in patients with early stage HCC. The CHB natural history influenced density of tumour-infiltrating Tregs in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with chronic hepatitis B viruses infection.
