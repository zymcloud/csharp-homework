Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or Moschcowitz's syndrome is characterized by platelet and von Willebrand factor (vWF) deposition in arterioles and capillaries throughout the body, which results in organ ischemia. The diagnostic pentad characterizing TTP consists of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), fever, neurologic manifestations, and renal insufficiency. In terms of type, TTP can be either idiopathic or secondary. The causes of secondary TTP include pregnancy, infections, pancreatitis, collagen vascular disease, cancer, bone marrow transplantation, and drugs (including cephalosporins). Postoperative TTP has been reported after vascular surgery, renal and liver transplantations, and orthopedic, urologic, and abdominal surgical procedures. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) therapy has reduced the mortality rates, but sometimes patients may have to receive immunosuppressive drugs including vincristine (VCR). This report describes a 42-year-old woman with TTP after prophylactic usage of cefuroxime axetil in relation to a liposuction procedure who was treated successfully with plasma exchange and VCR. The patient fully recovered after 17 TPEs and three doses of VCR. At this writing, her TTP still is in remission after 6 months of follow-up evaluation. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report in the literature describing a patient with TTP after cefuroxime axetil administered in relation to a surgical procedure who was treated successfully with TPE and VCR.
