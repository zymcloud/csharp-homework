Background:Intrahepatic and extrahepatic recurrence remains a significant problem for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) for histological tumor grading and preoperative prediction of early HCC recurrence within 6 months of operation.Methods:A total of 44 patients who had undergone hepatic resection for HCC (50 nodules) were reviewed retrospectively. DWI was performed within 30 days before hepatectomy, and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured using 2 methods: mean ADC and minimum-spot ADC. Relationships between ADCs and histological differentiation and between ADCs and early recurrence of HCC were analyzed.Results:Mean ADC was significantly lower in poorly differentiated HCC (n=18, 1.07±0.15×10(-3) mm2/s) than in moderately differentiated HCC (n=29, 1.29±0.21×10(-3) mm2/s; P6 months after resection, 9 showed early recurrence. Minimum-spot ADC was significantly lower in patients with early recurrence (n=9, 0.64±0.24×10(-3) mm2/s) than in patients without early recurrence (n=25, 0.88±0.19×10(-3) mm2/s; PConclusion:Quantitative measurement of ADC of HCC with magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging is a promising functional imaging tool in the prediction of histological grade and early recurrence before treatment.
