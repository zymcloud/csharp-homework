Using short hairpin RNA against p53, transient ectopic expression of wild-type p53 or mutant p53 (R248W or R175H), and a p53- and p21-dependent luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that growth arrest and apoptosis of FaDu (human pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma), Hep3B (hepatoma), and MG-63 (osteosarcoma) cells induced by aloe-emodin (AE) are p53-independent. Co-immunoprecipitation and small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies demonstrated that AE caused S-phase cell cycle arrest by inducing the formation of cyclin A-Cdk2-p21 complexes through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. Ectopic expression of Bcl-X(L) and siRNA-mediated Bax attenuation significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by AE. Cyclosporin A or the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK blocked AE-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and prevented increases in reactive oxygen species and Ca(++). Z-IETD-FMK inhibited AE-induced apoptosis, Bax expression, Bid cleavage, translocation of tBid to mitochondria, ERK phosphorylation, caspase-9 activation, and the release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and endonuclease G from mitochondria. The stability of the mRNAs encoding caspase-8 and -10-associated RING proteins (CARPs) 1 and 2 was affected by AE, whereas CARP1 or 2 overexpression inhibited caspase-8 activation and apoptosis induced by AE. Collectively, our data indicate AE induces caspase-8-mediated activation of mitochondrial death pathways by decreasing the stability of CARP mRNAs in a p53-independent manner.
