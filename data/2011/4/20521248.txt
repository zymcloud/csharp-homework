Vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy is a promising treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its clinical benefit is often accompanied by acquired resistance. In animal studies, antiplacental growth factor therapy is effective with less resistance. The role of placental growth factor (PlGF) in the progression of HCC is not clear. In our study, we used immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays to investigate PlGF expression in tumor and peritumoral liver tissues from 105 patients with HCC. Intratumoral and peritumoral PlGF mRNA expression was analyzed in another cohort of 37 patients. Peritumoral PlGF expression was significantly higher than intratumoral PlGF expression (p
