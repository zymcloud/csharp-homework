We report a case of diffuse infiltrating carcinoma of the large intestine effectively treated by operation and chemotherapy. A 79-year-old woman with bone and liver metastases due to descending colon carcinoma underwent left hemicolectomy and colostomy. Pathological resected specimen findings showed a diffuse infiltrating carcinoma(lymphangiosis type). She re- ceived chemotherapy with 7 courses of mFOLFOX6, 8 courses of mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab(BV), and 5 courses of FOLFIRI/BV after surgical resection. The liver metastases reduced markedly as observed by abdominal CT scan. Twelve months later, DIC caused the death of the patient. Resection with lymphadenectomy and systemic chemotherapy may be effective for treatment of diffuse infiltrating carcinoma of the large intestine.
