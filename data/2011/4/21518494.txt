This study was purposed to investigate the effect of multiple myeloma patients' sera on hepcidin mRNA expression of Hep-3b hepatoma cell line and effect of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) antibody or recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) on hepcidin mRNA expression. The clinical information and serum of multiple myeloma patients were collected. Their sera of a final concentration of 10% were added into Hep-3b cell medium. The mRNA from Hep-3b cells was extracted, and hepcidin mRNA expression was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A final concentration of 10 ng/ml human IL-6 antibody and 2 U/ml rhEPO were added into the medium respectively. The results showed that the sera of untreated multiple myeloma patients elevated hepcidin mRNA expression of Hep-3b cells, compared with healthy controls and iron deficiency anemia patients. This effect was fully neutralized by human IL-6 antibody or rhEPO. The hemoglobin (Hb) level was stable during the follow up of regularly treated multiple myeloma patients and the effect of MM patient serum on Hep-3b cell hepcidin mRNA expression was reduced. It is concluded that the hepcidin mRNA expression of Hep-3b cell can be increased by untreated multiple myeloma patient serum. This promotive effect can be antagonised by IL-6, which suggests that IL-6 may be possible to elevate expression level of hepcidin in Hep-3b cells and results in anemia of chronic disease (ACD). The above mentioned promotive effects also can be suppressed by rhEPO, which indicates that the rhEPO may possess curative effect for ACD disease. During short-term follow-up of treated patients with multiple myeloma the Hb level is stable, the influence of patients serum on hepcidin mRNA of Hep-3b cells decreases, which shows the stabilization of disease and amelioration of ACD patient status.
