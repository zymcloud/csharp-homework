Purpose:There have been reports that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is as equally effective as surgical resection for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to evaluate recurrence rate and risk factor of recurrence after RFA combined with TACE for early stage HCC.Methods:We reviewed the medical records of the patients who were diagnosed with early stage HCC between March 2006 and August 2008 at Korea University Medical Center and treated with RFA combined with TACE for curative intent (n = 65).Results:Recurrence rate was 40% (26 cases) and the time to recurrence was 14.9 months. Cumulative recurrence rate at 1 year was 20% (13 cases) and at 2 years was 33.8% (22 cases). Significant variables for recurrence were: (1) RFA repeated more than one session at initial therapy (P Conclusions:The recurrence rate of combination therapy was considerably high. Regardless of the therapy used, careful post-RFA follow-up is needed, especially if additional treatment is required after the first session or if the main lesion is â‰¥2 cm at the time of RFA.
