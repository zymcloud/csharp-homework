Purpose:To evaluate hepatobiliary phase magnetic resonance imaging with gadobenate dimeglumine for differentiation of benign hypervascular liver lesions from malignant or high-risk lesions.Methods and materials:Retrospective assessment was performed of 550 patients with 910 hypervascular lesions (302 focal nodular hyperplasia [FNH], 82 nodular regenerative hyperplasia [NRH], 59 hepatic adenoma or liver adenomatosis [HA/LA], 329 hepatocellular carcinomas [HCC], 12 fibrolamellar-HCC [FL-HCC], 21 peripheral cholangiocarcinomas [PCC], 105 metastases). Imaging was performed before and during the arterial, portal-venous, equilibrium, and hepatobiliary phases after gadobenate dimeglumine administration (0.05 mmol/kg). Histologic confirmation was available for â‰¥1 lesion per patient, except for patients with suspected FNH (diagnosis based on characteristic enhancement/follow-up). Lesion differentiation (benign/malignant) on the basis of contrast washout and lesion enhancement (hypo-/iso-/hyperintensity) was assessed (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV) relative to histology or final diagnosis.Results:On portal-venous or equilibrium phase images, washout was not seen for 208 of 526 (39.5%) malignant (HCC, FL-HCC, PCC, metastases) and high-risk (HA/LA) lesions. Conversely, only 5 of 384 (1.3%) true benign lesions (FNH/NRH) showed washout. Taking washout as indicating malignancy, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignant lesion identification during these phases was 61.8%, 98.7%, and 77.4%. On hepatobiliary phase images, 289 of 302 FNH, 82 of 82 NRH, 1 of 59 HA or LA, 62 of 341 HCC or FL-HCC, and 2 of 105 metastases were hyperintense or isointense. Taking iso- or hyperintensity as an indication for lesion benignity, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV for benign lesion identification was 96.6%, 87.6%, 91.4%, 85.1%, and 97.3%, respectively.Conclusions:Hepatobiliary phase imaging with gadobenate dimeglumine is accurate for distinguishing benign lesions from malignant or high-risk lesions. Biopsy should be considered for hypointense lesions on hepatobiliary phase images after gadobenate dimeglumine.
