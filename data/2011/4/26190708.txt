Hypoglycemia caused by insulin-like growth factor II is difficult to control. A 77-year-old woman was diagnosed with gastric cancer and multiple liver metastases in September 2006 and underwent chemotherapy; however, at that time there were no symptoms of hypoglycemia. From January 2007 onwards, hypoglycemic comas and symptoms of hypoglycemia began to appear frequently. Her serum level of insulin was normal; thus, we suspected the presence of big insulin-like growth factor II was causing the hypoglycemia. This was proven by Western immunoblotting and we diagnosed non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia associated with gastric cancer. Overnight nutrition provided via a central venous catheter port to prevent hypoglycemia allowed the patient to become ambulant and to remain free of hypoglycemic coma at follow-up until her death 7 months later.
