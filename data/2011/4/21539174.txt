A 22-year-old Airman was presented to the clinic with new onset abdominal pain, which revealed to be well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma in a young patient with no cirrhosis or fibrosis is a relatively rare diagnosis with possible relationship to exercise supplement use. With the high incidence of supplement use in the military population, caution and further investigation into supplement use with correlation to the incidence of liver cancers may be warranted.
