Objective:To investigate the expression features of glypican-3 (GPC-3) and its diagnostic and differential values in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Rat hepatoma models were made and the dynamic expression features of GPC-3 protein and its gene were investigated by Western blotting and RT-PCR respectively. Liver specimens from 36 HCC patients were collected by self-control method and the expression and clinicopathological features of GPC-3 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Serum GPC-3 levels were quantitatively detected by ELISA and its efficiency for HCC diagnosis was evaluated in patients with liver diseases.Results:The incidence of GPC-3 was 0% in control, 83.3% in degeneration, 100% in precancerosis and 100% in canceration during dynamic formation of rat hepatoma, respectively. The positive GPC-3 was brown granule- like staining localized in membrane and cytoplasm in human HCC.Conclusions:The GPC-3 positive rates were 80.6% in HCC, 41.7% in surrounding tissues and none in distal tissues (P
