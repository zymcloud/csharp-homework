Aims and background:We report the results of intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were not candidate for local ablative therapies, transarterial chemoembolization or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy.Methods and study design:Between 2003 and 2008, 27 patients were treated with high-dose radiotherapy (median dose, 50.4 Gy). The equivalent sphere size of tumors was 11.4 Â± 2.6 cm. Nineteen and 8 patients were Child-Pugh class A and B, respectively. Eighteen patients had thromboses in large veins. Six patients were treated with radiotherapy as the initial treatment modality, and 21 patients received other treatments before radiotherapy.Results:The overall response rate was 44.4% (1 pathologic complete response and 11 partial responses). The primary failure pattern was intrahepatic disease progression. Until the last follow-up, the primary liver masses and vein thromboses did not progress in 63.6% and 60.0% of the patients, respectively. The median progression-free survival and overall survival after radiotherapy rate were 3 and 5 months, respectively. Based on univariate analyses, response, Child-Pugh classification, and vein thrombosis were significant factors for overall survival, and tumor response, tumor size, vein thrombosis, and multiplicity were significant factors for progression-free survival. Tumor response was the only significant prognostic factor for overall survival and progression-free survival based on multivariate analyses.Conclusions:Radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy achieved a good response rate in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and patients who had a good response lived longer than patients who did not have a good response.
