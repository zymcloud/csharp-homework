Background/aims:The purpose of this study was to investigate whether bubble images after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can predict the ablated area.Methodology:The spread of bubbles 5 minutes after RFA were compared with the unenhanced area of virtual sonography with magnetic navigation in two RFA methods: expandable needle and cool-tip needle.Results:Thirty-one hepatocellular carcinoma nodules were treated by RFA with either an expandable needle or cool-tip needle (n=14 and n=17, respectively) and examined. In the 14 nodules treated by expandable needle, bubble images (puncture direction; r=0.833, p=0.0002, perpendicular direction; r=0.803, p=0.0005) were closely correlated with the unenhanced area of virtual sonography. On the other hand, in 17 nodules treated by cool-tip needle, there was no correlation between the bubble images and virtual sonography (puncture direction; r=0.590, p=0.0127, perpendicular direction; r=0.342, p=0.180).Conclusions:The observation of bubbles with the expandable needle can accurately predict the ablated area and is helpful for assessing local control of RFA.
