To determine the variety of chemotherapy drugs administrable for malignant pancreatic neoplasm as a result of typification with endoscopic ultrasonography-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). A retrospective assessment, in one center, over a period of 1 year. Only malignant pancreatic neoplasm diagnosed by EUS-FNA was recorded. Benign (serous cystic neoplasm) and potentially malignant lesions (mucinous cystic neoplasm and intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm) were excluded. Medical data were recorded and Oncological Pharmacy records were studied. Ductal adenocarcinoma were detected in 17 patients (N = 17/22), 2 of them with adenocarcinoma in signet ring and 1 with mucinous adenocarcinoma. The primary therapies used were as follows: Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy (3), biliary stent by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (3), radiological transhepatic percutaneous stent (2), intestinal bypass (2), and a gastric stent (1). The adjuvant drugs used were gemcitabine (10), erlotinib (3), and cetuximab (1), and also radiotherapy was used (1). An unresectable squamous cell carcinoma (N = 1) of the tail was detected, and gemcitabine + vinorelbine + fluorouracil + cisplatin used. Nonfunctioning neuroendocrine tumors were seen in 3 (N = 3) cases and long-acting somatostatin analogues were used (1); the remaining 2 patients showed resectable tumors and were resected accordingly. A metastasis to the pancreatic head in a hepatocellular carcinoma was found in 1 patient (N = 1), allowing specific treatment with sorafenib. Histopathologic analysis with EUS-FNA implies a variety of different treatments. Optimal management was achieved as a result of improved diagnosis, with the advent of new molecular genetic diagnostic methods facilitating the design of specific new therapy and neoadjuvant targeting strategies.
