Dentists are exposed to carcinogenic metals during their work. It has been speculated that dentists are also at high risk for occupational exposure to bloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C. We suspected that Japanese dentists were at increased risk for lung and liver cancer. To assess this question, we compared the number of pathological diagnoses of lung cancer and liver cancer among autopsy cases of male dentists (n=225) with that among autopsy cases of male medical doctors (n=1,296), based on data from the Annual of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan from 1992 to 1999. We calculated the mortality odds ratio of lung cancer and liver cancer, using stomach cancer as the control. No difference between the dentist group and the medical doctor group was observed in the pathological diagnoses of lung cancer among all autopsy cases (p=0.703, Odds Ratio: 0.846, 95% confidence interval: 0.461-1.554). Liver cancer was observed less often among dentists than among medical doctors (p=0.047, Odds Ratio: 0.474, 95% confidence interval: 0.239-0.941). Based on the results of this study, we suggest that Japanese male dentists do not have a higher risk of developing lung cancer than male medical doctors, and have a lower risk of developing liver cancer.
