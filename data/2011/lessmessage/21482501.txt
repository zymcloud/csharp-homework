Liver transplantation (LT) is an established therapy associated with a dramatic improvement in patients life expectancy. With improved early-term management, current 10-year patient survival rates in many indications exceed 70%. Life-long immunosuppressive therapy may, however, be accompanied by considerable longterm toxicity: most importantly, renal dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, which, in addition to recurrence of the primary liver disease, emerge as key contributors to late mortality. Chronic kidney disease cumulatively affects up to 28% of patients by ten years after LT. Various factors can contribute to renal impairment, but perioperative acute kidney injury, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, hypertension, and diabetes are considered most important. LT patients demonstrate 3-fold risk for cardiovascular events, which seems to result mostly from an excess of traditional risk factors, mainly hypertension and diabetes. The cumulative cancer incidence reaches 16-42% by 20 years after LT, and cancer rates are 2- to 4-fold higher among LT patients than among matched controls. Highest rates are for nonmelanoma skin cancer (3- to 70-fold) and lymphoma (8- to 29-fold). The liver graft usually displays uncomplicated function in the long term. Most common causes for chronic graft dysfunction include disease recurrence and biliary problems. LT generally restores patients quality of life to a level comparable with that of the general population, with only minor deficits in some areas. Thus, long-term survival after LT is impressive, and despite these long-term complications, patients quality of life remains comparable with that of the general population.
