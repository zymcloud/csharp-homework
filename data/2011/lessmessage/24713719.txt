Sorafenib is shown to improve survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it has as yet not been tested in the liver transplantation (LT) setting. We report a 55-year-old man with multifocal HCC (stage B) related to hepatitis B virus cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B), initially treated with transarterial chemoembolization. After five months, sorafenib was added due to lack of response. This enhanced the downsizing of the tumor and eventually led to a surgically successful LT after 4 months of combined treatment. Sorafenib was re-initiated 15 months post-transplant due to skeletal tumor recurrence and led to patient's clinical improvement. The patient remains in good clinical condition 3 years after LT. Sorafenib was well tolerated throughout the entire period of administration with no serious or unexpected adverse events. We conclude that sorafenib can be safely used as a bridge to LT and in transplanted patients in case of HCC recurrence.
