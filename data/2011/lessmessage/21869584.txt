A 58-year-old man presented with a very rare case of pituitary metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma with active nasal bleeding which was treated by transarterial embolization using ethiodized oil (Lipiodol) and gelatin sponge. After treatment, nasal bleeding ceased and tumor size decreased. The prognosis for patients with pituitary metastases is very poor, so aggressive treatment is recommended to alleviate symptoms. This minimally invasive approach may be a reasonable therapeutic option for pituitary metastases.
