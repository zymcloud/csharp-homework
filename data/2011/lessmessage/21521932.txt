Hepatic ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a key role in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) production by apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) lipidation. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, statins, increase ABCA1 mRNA levels in hepatoma cell lines, but their mechanism of action is not yet clear. We investigated how statins increase ABCA1 in rat hepatoma McARH7777 cells. Pitavastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin increased total ABCA1 mRNA levels, whereas pravastatin had no effect. Pitavastatin also increased ABCA1 protein. Hepatic ABCA1 expression in rats is regulated by both liver X receptor (LXR) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP2) pathways. Pitavastatin repressed peripheral type ABCA1 mRNA levels and its LXR-driven promoter, but activated the liver-type SREBP-driven promoter, and eventually increased total ABCA1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, pitavastatin increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and its downstream gene expression. Knockdown of PPARα attenuated the increase in ABCA1 protein, indicating that pitavastatin increased ABCA1 protein via PPARα activation, although it repressed LXR activation. Furthermore, the degradation of ABCA1 protein was retarded in pitavastatin-treated cells. These data suggest that pitavastatin increases ABCA1 protein expression by dual mechanisms: SREBP2-mediated mRNA transcription and PPARα-mediated ABCA1 protein stabilization, but not by the PPAR-LXR-ABCA1 pathway.
