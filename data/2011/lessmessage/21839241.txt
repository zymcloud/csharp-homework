Objective:The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term survival, histological diagnoses, and mobility of patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis (CC) treated with orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Patients and methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of 35 patients who underwent transplantation with CC among 800 OLT patients. There were no differences in gender, mean age of 47 years, average MELD (Model for End-stage Liver Disease) of 16, and hepatocellular carcinoma incidence (8%).Results:In 28.6% of patients, the diagnosis of CC was wrong. There was no incidence of an acute rejection episode and a low incidence of complications, although the postoperative mortality rate was 20%, of chronic rejection was 25%, and recurrence of disease was 4%. Cumulative at 3-, 5-, and 10-year survivals were lower than the other OLT. Survival was lower in patients receiving suboptimal grafts.Conclusions:One of 3 patients who underwent transplantation for CC had a specific etiologic diagnosis. The chronic rejection rate and postoperative mortality rate were higher than other etiologies, and survivals at 5, 10, and 15 years were lower than other OLT.
