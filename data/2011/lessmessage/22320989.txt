Background:Oral cavity cancer is the eighth most frequent cancer among men in the world. Its incidence varies widely geographically and two-thirds of the incident cases are diagnosed in developing countries. The aim of this study was to present the mortality trends from this cancer for Iranian population during a period of almost a decade, in order to provide update information regarding time trends for this cancer.Methods:We analyzed National death Statistics reported by the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education from 1995 to 2004, stratified by age group, sex, and cause of death. Oral cavity cancer [ICD-10; C00-08] was assessed for annual mortality rates/100,000, overall, by sex and by age group (<15, 15-49 and â‰¥ 50 years of age) and age standardized rates (ASR) were calculated.Results:The age standardized mortality rate of oral cavity cancer increased dramatically during these years from 0.09 per 100,000 in 1995 to 0.59 per 100,000 in 2002. However, a sharp decrease was observed from 2002 to 2004. Moreover the mortality of oral cavity cancer was higher for males except from 2000-2002 during which the rate of female's death was close to male's. Age specific rates for oral cavity cancer indicated higher mortality rate for older age.Conclusion:In conclusion, this study provides comprehensive projection for burden of death due to oral cavity cancer, indicating that the trend of its mortality was increased in recent decade and then would be leveled off. While the burden of oral cavity cancer in Iran is lower than other Asian countries, further studies are required to establish risk factors or modifiers for this cancer in Iranian population in order to decrease its incidence and mortality.
