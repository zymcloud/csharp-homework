Background/aim:We previously reported the beneficial effects of a combination therapy of interferon (IFN)-α/5-fluorouracil (FU) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumor thrombi in the major portal branches. This report describes the results of longer follow-up and includes more than twice the number of patients relative to the previous report; it also evaluates the clinical predictor on the response to the combination therapy and long-term survival.Methods:The study subjects were 102 patients with advanced HCC and tumor thrombi in the major branches of the portal vein (Vp3 or 4). They were treated with at least 2 courses of IFN-α/5-FU.Results:No major treatment-related complications were noted. In the 102 patients, 40 (39.2%) showed objective response [11 (10.8%) showed complete response, 29 (28.4%) partial response], 8 (7.9%) showed no response and 54 (52.9%) showed progressive disease.Conclusion:IFN-α/5-FU combination therapy is a promising modality for advanced HCC with tumor thrombi in the major portal branches.
