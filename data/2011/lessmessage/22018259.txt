We report a rare case of a hepatic carcinosarcoma with rabdomyosarcomatous differentiation in its sarcomatous component. A 71-year old Caucasian female patient underwent a liver resection for a 4-cm lesion developed on an underlying HCV-related cirrhosis. Post-operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 5 days after surgery. At pathology, the tumor presented the features of hepatocellular carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma Three months later the patient experienced a liver recurrence, dying 2 months later for systemic disease. The reported case presents several peculiarities, i.e. the female gender, the HCV-related cirrhotic status, and the European origin of the patient. However, the outcome of our case confirms that this neoplasm pursues a highly aggressive course with poor prognosis.
