Distant metastases in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck are most often to the lung, liver and bone. They rarely metastasise to chest wall. We report a 60-year-old male patient who initially presented with an abscess over the anterior chest wall that was initially treated for infective pathology. Due to lack of response, cytological examination was performed that turned out to be metastasis from carcinoma larynx.
