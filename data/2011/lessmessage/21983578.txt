Repeated operations for focal liver lesions were analyzed. 75 patients with parasitic liver lesions (alveococcosis, echinococcosis), 14 patients with liver tumors, 15 patients with cysts and abscesses were included in the study. For the first time patients underwent palliative operations or diagnostic laparotomy. In some patients relapse was observed after radical surgery in postoperative period. Ultrasound study was the main diagnostic method for detecting localization and extent of the lesion. 91 patients underwent radical surgery, including hemihepatectomy carried out to 26 patients, segmental and bisegmental liver resections carried out to 35 patients. Transparenchymatous Tung ligation was used in liver resections. Resection line was covered by hemostatic sutures according to B.I. Alperovich technique. Intraparenchymatous processing of Glisson pedicle according to E.I. Galperin method was applied in extensive liver resections. Cryodestruction was used for prophylaxis of relapses in parasitic and tumor lesions. Liver failure (4) and bleedings (2) were the most life-threatening postoperative complications. 4 patients died due to liver failure (2) and bleedings (2). Among 97 patients good results were observed in 73 (75,3%) patients, satisfactory - in 22 (22,7%), poor - in 2 (2,1%) with relapse of hepatocellular carcinoma.
