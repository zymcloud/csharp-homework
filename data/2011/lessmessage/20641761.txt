Choline is an important component of phospholipids in the cell membranes. Tissues with increased metabolism will lead to an increased uptake of choline. Choline is phosphorylated by choline kinases (CHK) to phosphorylcholine within cells, and, after several biosynthetic processes, finally is integrated into phospholipids (1). Because tumor cells have a high metabolic rate, choline uptake is high in order to keep up with the demands with the synthesis of phospholipids in their cellular membranes (2).Positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]choline has been reported to be useful for the detection and differential diagnosis of brain tumors, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and esophageal cancer (3). However, [11C]choline has a high uptake in liver, kidney, and spleen. [18F]-labeled choline analog was initially synthesized as [18F]fluoroethylcholine to replace [11C]choline as a PET tracer due to the short physical half-life of 11C (4). Although 18F has a longer half-life (110 min), [18F]fluoroethylcholine showed a rapid accumulation in the urinary bladder, rendering it less desirable for imaging prostate cancer and pelvic lymph nodes. Therefore, [18F]fluorocholine (FCH) was conceived to be a better biological analog than [18F]fluoroethylcholine (5). FCH PET studies showed high uptake in malignancies in patients with prostate cancer, breast carcinoma, and brain tumors (6, 7).
