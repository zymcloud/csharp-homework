The aim of this study was to try to diagnose malignant liver lesions and hemangiomas by means of vascularisation and perfusion studies. The study was performed in 32 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in 74 with metastatic liver carcinoma (MLC) and in 40 with hemangiomas (H). Color Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) was done with an ATL Ultramark 9 apparatus with convex probe 2.5 MHz using pulse and DUS. Hepatic radionuclide angiography (HRA) was performed with bolus injection of 740 MBq (99m)Tc-pertechnetate, (1 min, 1 f/s), using ROTA scintillation camera and MicroDelta computer. Hepatic perfusion index (HPI) indicated the percentage of the portal blood inflow to the liver. Our results showed that in HCC and MLC there was a decrease of portal inflow while arterial inflow was increased resulting in pulse arterial wave velocity increase and in continuous venous waves velocity in the tumors. There was significant linear correlation between the increase of the arterial inflow and the arterial pulse wave found in the center and in the margin of the tumors. In hemangiomas, hepatic perfusion index related to arterial inflow was within normal range. In conclusion, our results suggest that HCC and MLC have specific characteristics in vascular and/or perfusion studies while hemangiomas show normal liver parenchyma findings.
