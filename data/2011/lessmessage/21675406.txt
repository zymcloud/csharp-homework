The Shanghai cancer registry, established in 1963, is the oldest one in mainland China; cancer registration is entirely done by passive methods. The registry contributed data on 52 cancer sites or types registered during 1992-1995 for this survival study. The methods of follow-up have been a mixture of both active and passive ones, with median follow-up ranging 3-81 months. The proportion with histologically verified diagnosis for various cancers ranged from 14-95%; death certificates only (DCOs) ranged from 0-2% and 98-100% of total registered cases were included for survival analysis. The top ranking cancers on 5-year age-standardized relative survival (%) were thyroid (90%), non-melanoma skin (86%), penis (84%), corpus uteri (82%) and testis (80%). The corresponding survival rates for common cancers were lung (16%), stomach (30%), liver (9%), breast (78%) and colon (48%). The 5-year relative survival by age group reveals an inverse relationship for most cancers. An increasing trend in the 5-year absolute andrelative survival was noted for all cancers registered in 1992-1995 compared to 1988-1991.
