The main non-surgical treatments for liver lesions include chemotherapy, targeted treatments, chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation. The post-treatment imaging features are variable and depend on the initial appearance of the lesion, the type of treatment and the imaging modality. Evaluation of tumour response to treatment is important. RECIST criteria based on unidimensional lesion measurements may not always be appropriate. Other evaluation criteria (Choi for GIST, EASL for HCC or Chun criteria.) may be more relevant.
