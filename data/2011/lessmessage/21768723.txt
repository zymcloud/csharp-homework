Background:Hepatitis C virus is a common virus affecting human health. High rates of hepatitis C virus infection can be seen in many developing countries. It is accepted that hepatitis C virus is an oncogenic virus that can lead to liver cancer. Some recent researches also mentioned the possibility of hepatitis C virus as a risk for renal cell carcinoma.Aims:In this article, the author assesses the cause-outcome relationship between hepatitis C virus infection and renal cell carcinoma using the bioinformatics network analysis technique.Materials and methods:The author firstly tracked for the hepatitis C virus related protein and renal cell carcinoma related protein and further detected the common protein. Further, tracing of the biological process using ontology study of the identified proteins was done and finalized network of relationship was derived.Statistical analysis used:Bioinformatics technique.Results and conclusions:According to this study, there is only one common protein. Based on this work, it can be concluded that there might be cause-outcome relationship between hepatitis C virus infection and renal cell carcinoma via NY-REN-54. The process might be through the disturbance of autophagic response due to ubiquitin-protein ligase-related mechanism.
