Elevated serum levels of α-fetoprotein (AFP), a fetal serum protein, occur mainly in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or germ cell tumors, mainly yolk sac tumor. Rarely, other tumors of the urological system produce AFP. This article reviews the AFP-producing non-germ cell tumors of the urological tract reported to date. These include different types of tumors of the adrenal glands, kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, and testis. It is important for pathologists, urologists, and oncologists to be aware of such cases as the diagnosis affects the management plan for the patient.
