Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent malignant tumor. Tumor markers are very useful in early diagnosis; however a single marker is rather limited. We launched a test to increase the diagnostic sensitivity through the combined detection.Methodology:Serum concentration of three tumor-markers, Glypican-3 (GPC-3), Human-Cervical-Cancer-Oncogene (HCCR) and a-fetoprotein (AFP), were determined in 189 samples: 101 cases of HCC, 40 cases of cirrhosis, 18 cases of hepatitis and 30 cases of control healthy donors. Every marker was evaluated for its diagnostic value by one-way-analysis-of-variance and receiver-operating-characteristics analysis.Results:GPC-3 was the best marker with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.892; using 26.8ng/mL as the cut-off for HCC diagnosis, GPC-3 has a sensitivity of 51.5% and maintains a specificity of 92.8%. HCCR, with an AUC of 0.831, can reach a sensitivity of 22.8% and maintain a specificity of 90.9% if the cut-off is set as 58.8mAU/mL. With an AUC of 0.827, the efficacy and sensitivity of AFP were 36.6% and 98.5% when using 199.3ng/mL as the cut-off. No significant correlation was found between these three markers. Simultaneously detecting three markers can significantly increases the sensitivity to 80.2%, much higher than AFP alone.Conclusions:GPC-3 and HCCR are useful tumor markers complementary to AFP for clinical diagnosis of HCC.
