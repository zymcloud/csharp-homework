Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection in comparison with single HBV infection causes more severe liver disease in nonuremic population. The long-term impact of HBV/HCV coinfection on severity of liver diseases and patient survival in hemodialysis patients is unclear. Forty-eight HBV-positive patients and 19 HBV/HCV-positive patients were followed up from February 1996 to September 2006. During 10-year follow-up, there was no difference in acute hepatitis episodes, abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase period, occurrence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and patient survival between the two groups. The serum HBV DNA levels in HBV/HCV-positive patients were significantly lower than those in HBV-positive patients during the first 27-month follow-up. In conclusion, HCV infection suppresses the serum HBV DNA level in hemodialysis patients. Nevertheless, HBV/HCV coinfection in comparison with single HBV infection does not cause more severe liver diseases or reduce patient survival in hemodialysis patients during 10-year follow-up.
