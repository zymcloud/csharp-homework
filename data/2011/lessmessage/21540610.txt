This report presents a case of a patient with a huge hepatocellular carcinoma in the right lobe of the liver with an extensive portal venous tumor thrombus extending into the main portal trunk and left portal branch. The patient underwent extended right hemihepatectomy with tumor thrombectomy with direct extraction from an opening of the ventral wall of the right portal vein and using a balloon catheter to push the tumor thrombus via the surgically reopened umbilical vein. This technique seems useful in cases of tumor thrombus that extend deep into the umbilical portion of the left portal vein. In addition, this technique may have minimized the intraoperative migration of the tumor thrombus into the future remnant liver by occluding portal flow with the balloon catheter during the thrombectomy.
