Background:It has been frequently shown that p53 alterations have an important role in the development of gastric cancers but there is no data on p53 alteration in gastric cancer and its precancerous lesions from Iran although this country experiences one of the highest gastric cancer incidence and mortality rates in the world. The purpose of this study was to do a comprehensive assessment of p53 alterations in the Iranian population of gastritis patients and to evaluate the association between p53 alterations, microsatellite status and clinicopathological aspects.Methods:After DNA extraction, PCR sequencing was done for exons 2-7. Also microsatellite status was evaluated using five microsatellite markers: NR-27, NR-21, NR-24, BAT-25 and BAT-26.Results:The highest rate of alteration was seen in codons 72 (85.6%, SNP) and 248 (30.9%, mutation). Also, we found 2 new mutations in codons 9 and 146. In contrast with previous work, transition at the CpG codons was relatively rare. Nucleotide alterations were more prevalent in the Helicobacter pylori-positive group but not significantly. Neither nuclear staining for p53 protein nor microsatellite instability was seen in gastritis lesions.Conclusion:p53 alterations might contribute to the pathogenesis of gastritis and perhaps gastric cancer in Iran. However, the different spectrum seen here implies other mechanism(s) in gastritis and gastric cancer development in the Iranian population.
