We have developed a galactose-modified cationic liposome for delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to the liver. The liposomes were designed to be transported into hepatocytes via the asialoglycoprotein receptor, which recognizes galactose residues. The liposomes contained a novel galactose-modified lipid, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidyl-N-(1-deoxylactito-1-yl)ethanolamine (GDOPE). Delivery of siRNA to hepatocytes by the liposomes was evaluated by measuring the gene-silencing activity of liposome : siRNA complexes in two human hepatoma cell lines. A formulation with a cationic lipid : GDOPE ratio of 3 : 5 by weight, LIC-G5, showed the strongest activity. In mice, intravenous injection of LIC-G5 complexed with (3)H-labeled siRNA led to accumulation of radioactivity in the liver. When the hepatic cellular uptake was determined after intravenous injection into mice followed by collagenase liver perfusion, the distribution of siRNA to parenchymal cells was 1.9 times higher when LIC-G5 rather than nongalactosylated LIC was used as the carrier. The concentration of siRNA accumulated was 45 Âµg/ml, 30 times the concentration that produced strong gene silencing in vitro and therefore presumably sufficient for a therapeutic effect. Because increasing the cationic-lipid content of a liposome carrier generally enhances the uptake of siRNA by the liver at the expense of increased cell toxicity, we used only a moderate amount of cationic lipid in our galactose-modified carrier. LIC-G5 enhanced the uptake of siRNA by the liver without cytotoxic effects and is a promising candidate delivery system for liver-targeted siRNA therapy.
