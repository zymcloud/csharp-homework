Background:The aim of the study is evaluation of the possible role of the scintigraphic estimation of the relative liver perfusion in diagnosis and the choice of treatment of liver carcinomas.Material and methods:Hepatic perfusion index was obtained by dynamic scintigraphy in 126 patients.Results:In the control group values did not differ from the value in the patients with benign tumors (p > 0.05). However, in hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases of different tumors, HPI values were significantly decreased in comparison to controls and benign tumors (p 0.05). The values were especially low in the patients with malignant diseases in the liver accosciated with vascular disturbances in the portal system.Conclusion:HRA could be easily done during the different conventional nuclear medicine methods. It can be an useful method for the assessment of different degrees of hemodynamic alterations in portal system, for differential diagnosis of benign and malignant liver tumors, as well as for assessment of the liver tissue and tumor perfusion, which might be helpful in the decision making for the undertaking of intraarterial (radionuclide, chemotherapy etc.) therapy.
