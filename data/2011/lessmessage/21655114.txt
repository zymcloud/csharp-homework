Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers, which is mainly a concern in Southeast Asia. Apoptosis resistance in HCC is one of the significant factors for hepatocarcinogenesis and tumour progression. Recent advances of apoptosis resistance mechanisms in HCC could serve as potential targets for molecular imaging, which would be of considerable value to explore the molecular processes involved in HCC progression and to evaluate responses of certain anti-HCC therapies. Disruptions in the balance of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic processes have been found to be involved in apoptosis resistance in HCC. Loss of response to death receptors, transformation of growth factor-β induced apoptosis, upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 subgroup, as well as downregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax subgroup and BH3-only subgroup, are associated with apoptosis resistance in HCC. Mutation of p53 gene, dysregulation of NF-κB and survivin are also of interest because of their contribution to HCC development. In this review, the aim is to identify potential targets for molecular imaging of apoptosis resistance in HCC.
