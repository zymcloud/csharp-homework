Background/aims:The prognosis of ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported to be poor, but some studies have reported better survival with staged hepatectomy. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical features of ruptured HCC.Methodology:Among 305 patients with HCC who underwent hepatic resection between 1990 and 2008 in our institution, 10 patients had ruptured HCC. Ruptured group (Group R; n=10)were compared with those of patients with unruptured HCC group (Group UR; n=295), concerning hepatic reserve, tumor extent and outcome.Results:Rupturedgroup had extremely large tumor than unruptured group (94 + 43 mm vs. 45 +/- 32 mm, p Conclusions:The patients with spontaneously ruptured HCC had advanced disease, and poor prognosis. Hepatic resection might improve the survival, but a new therapeutic strategy is necessary for the long-term survival of patients with ruptured HCC.
