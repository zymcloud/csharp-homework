Chronic infection with HBV or HCV can lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The major risk factors for HBV-related HCC are persistent presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and/or high serum HBV DNA levels, and cirrhosis. The major risk factor for HCV-related HCC is cirrhosis. One randomized double blind controlled trial of lamivudine in patients with HBeAg and/or high serum HBV DNA levels showed that antiviral therapy prevented disease progression and reduced the incidence of HCC. A beneficial effect of antiviral therapy on the risk of HCC has also been shown in cohort studies and meta-analyses, particularly among responders. Several randomized controlled trials of interferon in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis showed that treated patients had a lower incidence of HCC. A greater effect was observed in patients who achieved sustained virological response, while the benefit in non-responders is unclear. Antiviral therapies for hepatitis B and hepatitis C can prevent but not completely eliminate HCC. Improvement in identification of infected persons, accessibility of care and affordability of treatment is needed for antiviral therapy to have a major impact on the global incidence of HCC.
