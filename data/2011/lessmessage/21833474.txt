5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX) has been implicated in the development and progression of lung, pancreatic and esophageal cancers. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the role of 5-LOX in the pathogenesis of HCC. The expression of 5-LOX was detected in human HCC, HepG2 cells and diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat HCC using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Apoptosis in rat HCC was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined in HepG2 cells by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. IHC staining showed that the 5-LOX protein was highly expressed in human HCC, HepG2 cells and rat HCC, but not in the normal liver tissues. 5-LOX mRNA expression in human and rat HCC was also significantly increased compared to normal liver tissues. Zileuton, a 5-LOX inhibitor, reduced the nodule incidence and the mean number of nodules per nodule-bearing liver in DEN-induced rats. Further study using TUNEL assay showed that zileuton treatment induced apoptosis in the liver as the result of inhibition on 5-LOX levels. This result is consistent with our observation of significantly higher apoptotic indices in rats treated with DEN/zileuton, which were significantly higher compared to those from the control groups. In addition, zileuton reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner as detected using HepG2 cells in our in vitro analysis. In conclusion, 5-LOX is expressed in HCC, and the inhibition of 5-LOX blocks the development of HCC via the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells.
