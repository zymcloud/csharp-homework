Literature data indicate an association between the presence of Helicobacter spp. in the liver and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of H. pylori infections in chronic liver diseases (CLD) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to detect Helicobacter spp. DNA in patients with CLD, and to investigate the host response to the presence of the bacterium in the liver. Helicobacter spp. DNA was detected in 59% samples. H.pylori was the most prevalent species (94%). We estimated the expression level of IL-1 and IL-8 genes. The presence of Helicobacter spp. did not have a significant effect on the gene expression of IL-8 and IL-1.
