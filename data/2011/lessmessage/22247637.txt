Objective:To report our initial experience on the technical feasibility and safety for hemostasis of a new pneumatic compression device in patients undergoing femoral arteriotomy.Materials and methods:This study included 40 consecutive patients in whom hemostasis after transfemoral catheterization was readered by using a pneumatic compression device consisting of an inflatable bulb-containing main body and four pieces of supplementary tape. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for outcomes and complications of hemostasis. Technical success was defined as achieving immediate hemostasis 10 minutes after applying the device over the arteriotomy sites, and clinical success was defined as the ability to ambulate after 4 hours of bed rest without any complications.Results:Technical and clinical success was achieved in 38 (95%) and 37 (93%) patients, respectively. In two patients, hemostasis was achieved after conversion to manual compression. One patient required sand bag placement after removal of the device to control minimal oozing of blood. No patients had late complications.Conclusion:The new pneumatic compression device provides effective and safe hemostasis after transfemoral catheterization in selected patient populations.
