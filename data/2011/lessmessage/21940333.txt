Background/aims:The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides transfection of angiopioetin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) on the proliferation and invasion capacities of human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells in vitro.Methodology:ANGPTL3 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides was transfected into SMMC-7721 cells with Lipofectamine 2000. We used MTT assay to evaluate cell growth. ANGPTL3, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) mRNA expression levels were evaluated by RT-PCR. The invasive potency of SMMC-7721 cells was measured by the transwell cell invasion assay.Results:ANGPTL3 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were successfully transfected into SMMC-7721 cells, resulting in the significant inhibition of ANGPTL3, p38MAPK and MMP-9 mRNA expression. Downregulation of ANGPTL3 inhibited cell proliferation and decreased invasion of SMMC-7721 cells.Conclusions:ANGPTL3 may be functionally involved in hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion and is a potential target for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.
