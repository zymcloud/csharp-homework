There are no effective conventional systemic cytotoxic therapies for patients with unresectable or advanced hepatocellar carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib, an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was recently approved for the treatment of patients with HCC. Sorafenib is generally well tolerated and has an acceptable toxicity profile.Gastrointestinal perforation is a rare adverse event. We present a case of transverse colon perforation during sorafenib therapy for advanced HCC. A 68-year-old woman with advanced HCC was treated with sorafenib. Eight weeks later the patient presented with the sudden onset of sharp abdominal pain. Emergency surgery was performed for panperitonitis and a perforation involving the transverse colon.
