Purpose:To assess the added value of depicting tumour microvascularisation, using dynamic contrast enhanced (CEUS), during radiofrequency ablation, as a means of achieving a complete ablation (CA) of malignant liver lesions.Material and methods:18 consecutive patients (2 female, 16 male, age range 52-79 years, mean 64.1 Â± 9.9 years) with 22 histologically confirmed hepatic malignancies (HCC: n = 10, liver metastases: n = 12) underwent RFA. Before RFA treatment, conventional US, CEUS and contrast enhanced CT (ceCT) of the liver were performed. During the CT-guided RFA procedure, CEUS was performed to asses the ablation defect. In case of partial ablation a subsequent ablation was performed with a corrected electrode position and evaluated again using CEUS. This procedure was repeated until a CA was achieved. The number of ablations per patient was recorded. Secondary efficacy parameters assessed were lesion detectability in the different imaging modalities and contrast phases.Results:Overall intraprocedural CEUS led to a change in therapeutic management in 59% of cases, resulting in 17 additional ablation cycles. Lesion detectability during CT Fluoroscopy was the sole statistical significant predictor of incomplete ablations (p = 0.008). The mean number of ablations for detectable lesions was 1.27 vs. 2.27 ablations for not detectable lesions (p = 0.002). The combined CT and CEUS RFA procedure led to a CA for all treated lesions in follow up 3 month post intervention.Conclusion:CEUS does allow a reliable and immediate assessment of therapeutic efficacy of percutaneous RFA procedures of malignant liver lesions, through the continuous dynamic evaluation of tumour microcirculation.
