Clinicopathological studies on the effects of combining immunostimulant drugs (levamisole) with anti-cancer drugs (chlorambucil) revealed the enhancement of the latter against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma-bearing mice and resulted in a reduction in the size of tumour. An evaluation of liver and kidney functions showed a significant increase of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and creatinine in all groups. Histopathological studies of one group that received an intraperitoneal injection of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells (2.5 × 10⁶) showed that hepatic parenchyma revealed degenerative changes. The portal area was oedematous and showed rounded cell aggregations. Cell death within hypertrophied Kupper cells was observed in some hepatic cells. The neoplastic emboli could be seen either inside blood vessels or hepatic sinusoids, while another group which had been treated orally with a combination of Leukeran(™) (0.2 mg/kg body weight) and levamisole (5 mg/kg body weight) revealed that hepatic parenchyma revealed massive necrosis with proliferative bile duct epithelium. No neoplastic cells were observed without the hepatic parenchyma, while the renal cortex presented a large number of lymphocytes and plasma cells forming bands or aggregates, mainly around the blood vessels. It was concluded that the addition of levamisole to chlorambucil improved the anti-cancer effect of chlorambucil against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. However, it had adverse effects on the liver and kidneys as shown by liver and kidney function tests and confirmed by histopathology.
