Hepatitis C virus is also associated with extrahepatic manifestations that may be the first clinical presentation of infection. Cutaneous disease can constitute a significant part of the wide spectrum of extrahepatic abnormalities associated with Hepatitis C infection. The aim of the present study was to estimate the extra burden of dermatological manifestations as a result of Hepatitis C virus infection in Kuwait.Methodology:A total of 75 positive antibody patients to hepatitis C virus were enrolled in the study and compared to an age and gender-matched control group which comprised 75 healthy individuals with negative antibody to hepatitis C virus results.Results:Generalized pruritus was significantly increased (22.67%) in chronic Hepatitis C infected patients compared to controls (5.33%), (pConclusion:Cutaneous manifestations may be the first clinical sign of chronic Hepatitis C infection.
