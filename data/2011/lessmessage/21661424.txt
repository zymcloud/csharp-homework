Background/aims:We investigated the correlation of HBV pre-S mutation with the sites and frequencies of mtDNA mutations in HCC patients.Methodology:Twenty-seven HBV-related HCC patients and 8 control patients were included. HBV DNA was extracted from sera and the HBV S coding region was analyzed. Direct sequencing of the mtDNA D-loop was performed in paired HCC and adjacent non-neoplastic liver tissues. The common 4977 bp deletion of miDNA was examined by PCR.Results:Study subjects were categorized into three groups: the pre-S mutant HBV-infected HCC patients (group 1), wild-type HBV-infected HCC patients (group 2) and HBV non-infected patients (group 3). The frequency of mtDNA D-loop mutations in non-neoplastic tissue was higher in group 1/2 than in group 3; however, there was no significant difference between group 1 and 2. The frequency of mtDNA D-loop mutations showed no significant difference between HCC and nonneoplastic tissues. The prevalence of the common 4977 bp deletion was lower in HCC compared to non-neoplastic tissues, however, there was no difference according to the pre-S mutation.Conclusion:The present study does not support a pathophysiological role for the HBV pre-S mutation, related to mtDNA D-loop mutation or alteration of the common 4977 bp deletion, in hepatocarcinogenesis.
