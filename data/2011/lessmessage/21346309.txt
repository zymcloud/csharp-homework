Objective:The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotypes, the spectrum of mutations in the precore/core region through phylogenetic analysis, and the relevance of viral characteristics in disease progression in Korean patients.Methods:133 patients with chronic HBV infection were enrolled. The precore and core region of HBV was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was performed for subgenotyping and the changes of nucleotides and amino acid were compared in liver disease stages.Results:HBV/C2 subgenotype was predominant in chronic HBV carriers (98.5%), followed by HBV/A2 (0.75%) and HBV/C7 (0.75%). The mutations of the precore region were not different between liver disease stages. However, amino acid changes in the cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope (p Conclusion:HBV/C2 is the most prevalent subgenotype in Korea, and HBV/C7 subgenotype found in the Philippines was first identified in the Korean population. Mutations in immune epitopes within the core gene were significantly associated with disease progression.
