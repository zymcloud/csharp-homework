Aims:The aim of this study is to investigate the activity and toxicity of etoposide with AUC 6 doses of carboplatin in patients with previously untreated extensive disease - small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).Materials and methods:88 eligible patients were treated with chemotherapy comprised of carboplatin AUC of 6, IV day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m 2 , IV day 1-3. This schedule was repeated every 21 days for maximum of six cycles.Results:Patients characteristics: Median age, 62 years; 84 male; ECOG PS 0-1 in 73 patients, PS 2-3 in 15 patients. A total of 431 cycles were administered (median, 6.0). The complete and partial response rates were 23.9% and 45.5%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.09 - 9.90 m); 84 patients died. The 1- and 2-year survival probabilities were 33.6% and 5.3%, respectively. The median progression-free survival in patients of 65 was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.81 - 8.58), 12-month PFS rate was 10%. The median OS was 11.6 months (95% CI, 8.52 - 14.67 m) and 7.5 months (95% CI, 5.61 - 9.38 m) in patients with non-liver and liver metastasis, respectively (P = 0.024). The median OS was 9.3 months (95% CI, 7.83 - 10.76 m) and 7.5 months (95% CI, 5.58 - 9.44 m) in patients with single and multiple distant metastasis, respectively (P = 0.02). Grade 3-4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were detected in 57.9%, 15.9%, and 11.4% of patients, respectively. Febrile neutropenia was developed in 12 patients.Conclusion:Etoposide with AUC 6 doses of carboplatin is active and tolerable in patients with extensive disease - SCLC.
