Background:The interactions among hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutations in developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear and thus we investigated the risk of HCC related with single or multiple HBV mutations in Korean patients infected with HBV subgenotype C2.Methods:From January 2003 to December 2008, HBV isolates from 135 patients with HCC were compared with those from 135 patients without HCC, matching for age, gender, and HBeAg status. The prevalence of preS deletions and G1896A and A1762T/G1764A mutations was evaluated.Results:The frequency of preS deletions significantly differed between the non-HCC and HCC groups, with 6 (4.4%) versus 25 (18.5%) patients, respectively (p Conclusions:HCC was associated with preS deletions and A1762T/G1764A mutations, and the combination of both mutations had a stronger association with HCC in Korean patients infected with HBV subgenotype C2.
