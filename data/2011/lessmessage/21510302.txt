Background/aims:Clarification of risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI) after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is important for improvement of surgical outcome.Methodology:The incidences of SSI under various states were evaluated in 171 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC. Univariate and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify risk factors for SSI. The relation between postoperative hepatic failure and SSI was also evaluated. Data were analyzed using Stat View 5.0.Results:SSI occurred in 36 patients (21%). Of the 36 patients with SSI, organ/space SSI occurred in 27. Bile leakage occurred in 22 patients, of which 18 patients had accompanying organ/space SSI. Postoperative hepatic failure occurred in 6 patients, and 5 of these 6 patients also had organ/ space SSI. The postoperative mortality rate was significantly higher in the patients with organ/space SSI (3 of 27 patients, 11%) than in those without organ/space SSI (1 of 144 patients, 0.7%). Logistic regression analysis revealed bile leakage and blood loss to be independent right factors for occurrence of organ/space SSI.Conclusions:Bile leakage frequently causes organ/space SSI after hepatectomy. Organ/space SSI is closely related to postoperative hepatic failure and death. Prevention of bile leakage is important to improve the surgical outcome of hepatectomy for HCC.
