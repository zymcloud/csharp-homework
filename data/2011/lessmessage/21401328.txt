Background:The genetic basis of susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a cytokine that may act as an endogenous tumor promoter. The association between TNF-α 308 G/A polymorphism and HCC risk remains unclear.Aim:The aim of this study was to investigate the association between TNF-α 308 G/A polymorphism and HCC risk in a Chinese population.Methods:The study population consisted of 88 patients with documented HCC and 88 healthy controls. The gene polymorphism of TNF-α was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay.Results:HCC patients had a significantly lower frequency GG (odds ratio=0.36; 95% confidence interval=0.13, 0.94; p=0.04) and G allele (odds ratio=0.58; 95% confidence interval=0.37, 0.90; p=0.01) than healthy controls. When stratifying for tumor size and cirrhosis, no statistically significant results were found.Conclusion:This study suggested that TNF-α -308GG and G allele were associated with a modest decrease in the risk of HCC in Chinese population.
