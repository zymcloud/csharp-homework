Objective:To assess prognostic aspects of treatment modalities for cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombi (PVTT).Method:121 treated cases were retrospectively divided into five groups: 1 (liver transplantation); 2 (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization); 3 (hepatectomy plus thrombectomy); 4 (hepatectomy plus thrombectomy combined with adjuvant chemobiotherapy via portal vein); and 5 (conservative treatment). The Kaplan-Meier method with difference in survival estimated by Log-rank test was used to compare between groups.Result:Groups 1-5 had a significantly differing median survival times of 7, 7, 10, 16, 3 months (PConclusion:Surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy via the portal vein is an effective and safe treatment modality for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombi.
