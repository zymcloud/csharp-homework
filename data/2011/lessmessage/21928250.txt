The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) gene promoter region have been reported to be associated with susceptibility to various types of cancers. A case-control study (126 hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] patients and 126 normal controls) was conducted to elucidate their possible association with the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC in a Han Chinese population. TNF-alpha polymorphisms -1031T/C, -863C/A, -857C/T, -308G/A, and -238G/A were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing. Disease associations were analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. When analyzed by overall groups, no significant differences in genotype and allele distributions were observed between the control and cases. However, stratified analysis according to sex showed that the frequency of the homozygous C allele of the -857 polymorphism was lower in female cases than in female controls (62.9% vs. 88.9%, p=0.026). In addition, further haplotype analysis revealed that the TCCGA (-1031/-863/-857/-308/-238) was more frequent in controls than cases (p=0.018; odds ratio = 0.266; 95% confidence interval, 0.083-0.857). These results indicated that the TNF-alpha-857C/T polymorphism may modify HBV-related HCC risk among women, and the haplotype TCCGA (-1031/-863/-857/-308/-238) may account for a decreased susceptibility to HCC development in the Han Chinese population. Additional studies in patients with different ethnic backgrounds are needed to validate these finding and to further explore the genetic pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC.
