Background:Arsenic trioxide (As₂O₃) induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma cell lines, but little is known about its pharmacology with this cancer in vivo. Pharmacokinetics after As₂O₃ injection into patients with a primary hepatocarcinoma (PHC) were therefore investigated.Methods:Fourteen patients were enrolled after providing informed consent and given daily intravenous doses of 10 mg for 14 days. Three mL blood samples were collected before and 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after the drug infusion on days 1 and 14, as well as once every other day from day 2, for measurement of plasma concentrations using an atom fluorescent assay and analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters with the PKBP-N1 program.Results:Data from 13 cases were evaluable, 1 case being excluded due to an insufficient blood sample. Pharmacokinetics were consistent with the characteristics of the two-compartment model, parameters on days 1 and 14 being closely similar. The mean plasma maximal peak concentration (Cpmax) was 136.4 ± 89.4 μg/L, plasma distribution half-life time (T½α) was 0.071 ± 0.027 hours, plasma elimination half-life time (T½β) was 23.9 ± 18.4 hours, apparent distribution volume (Vd) was 335.1 ± 387.0L, entry distribution volume (Vc) was 20.3 ± 21.3 L, system clearance (CLs) was 8.65 ± 4.26 L/h, area under curve (AUC0-t) of concentration-time was 1128.5 ± 510.3 μg/h/L. From days 2 to 14, minimal steady state plasma drug concentration (Cssmin) was in the range of 31.7 ± 9.27 μg/L to 55.6 ± 32.3 μg/L for 10 detected patients.Conclusions:The data suggested that a two-compartment model most accurately reflects As₂O₃ pharmacokinetics in PHC patients. The apparent distribution volume was comparatively large and the plasma drug concentration was a little low, with a comparatively long drug elimination half-life, so clinical administration of the drug should be individualized for the best clinical efficacy and prevention of side effects.
