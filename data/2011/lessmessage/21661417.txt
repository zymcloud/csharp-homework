Background/aims:To study the correlation and significance of beta-catenin, STAT3 and GSK-3beta signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:The HCC cell line HepG2 was transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against 8-catenin or STAT3. After 72 and 96h, protein was extracted and the protein expression of beta-catenin, STAT3, and GSK-3beta was detected by Western blot analysis.Results:After siRNA directed against beta-catenin was transfected into HepG2 cells, beta-catenin protein expression was decreased at 72 and 96h, GSK-3beta and p-GSK-3beta protein expression increased gradually at 72 and 96h, and STAT3 protein expression showed no change following transfection. After siRNA directed against STAT3 was transfected into HepG2 cells, STAT3 protein expression was decreased at 72 and 96h and beta-catenin, GSK-3beta and p-GSK-3beta protein expression all increased at 72h and decreased at 96 h after transfection.Conclusion:In HCC, the beta-catenin signaling pathway may regulate GSK-3beta protein expression and the STAT3 signaling pathway may regulate beta-catenin and GSK-3beta protein expression, thereby playing key roles during HCC genesis and development.
