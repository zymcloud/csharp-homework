Background:Deletion in liver cancer gene (DLC1) and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK) have recently been reported as metastasis-related genes. However, the roles and prognostic values of their expression in epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs) remain unclear.Methods:The expression and prognostic value of DLC1 and p-FAK Y397 in EOC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and multivariate analysis.Results:Low expression of DLC1 and high expression of p-FAK Y397 were found in the 76 cases of EOC. The expression of DLC1 and p-FAK Y397 were negatively correlated. Multivariate analysis showed that the combination of them was an independent prognostic marker of EOC (P = 0.0319).Conclusions:DLC1 and pFAK Y397 had an association with the clinicopathologic characteristics of EOC. Expression of neither of these genes was a prognostic factor alone, but the combination revealed a significant prognostic value in the 60 cases of advanced stage EOC.
