Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) of the female genital tract are aggressive and uncommon tumors. They usually involve the cervix and ovary, and are seen very rarely in the endometrium. The overwhelming majority of endometrial NECs are of conventional small cell type (up to 60 cases). Only seven cases of large cell type NEC of the endometrium have been reported. We report a case of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the endometrium in a 70-year-old female. The case is described for its rarity and shows that a high index of suspicion can help the pathologist to use immunohistochemistry and in turn help in selection of appropriate chemotherapy.
