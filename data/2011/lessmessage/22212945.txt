Liver transplantation (LT) is a viable therapeutic option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Many criteria, such as the Milan criteria and the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) criteria, have been established to select a subset of HCC patients who stand to benefit from LT. However, they are still insufficient for predicting HCC patients at high risk for recurrence and selecting those at low risk. Many molecules which are probable candidates for recognizing HCC patients at high or low risk for recurrence give a wider perspective to consider for LT indication. Besides working as biomarkers, most of them are also functionally involved in some important pathways which contribute to HCC metastasis. The complex network constituted by them shows a multichannel, multistep HCC metastatic process which indicates difficulty in tumor therapy. Given the efficacy of some molecular targeted drugs in the treatment of HCC or prevention of tumor recurrence after LT, the emerging molecular targeted therapy is also discussed in this review.
