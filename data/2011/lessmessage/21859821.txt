Background:Research biopsies are crucial for exploring the impact of novel agents on putative targets. The current study assesses the safety and success rate associated with performing such biopsies.Methods:We reviewed the medical records of 155 consecutive patients who had one or more research biopsies as part of a phase I trial from September 2004 to October 2009.Results:Of 281 research biopsies performed, 118 were paired before and after treatment biopsies (total = 236 biopsies). The most common sites of biopsy were superficial lymph node (19.9%), followed by liver (16.4%), and then soft tissue (15.7%). Ultrasound-guided biopsies were the most frequent type (53.7%). Among 142 patients who consented for mandatory biopsy, 86.6% had the biopsy performed, compared with 4.4% of 911 patients offered a biopsy on an optional basis (p < .0001). Biopsy was obtained most frequently on industry-sponsored trials; lack of funding on nonindustry trials was the most common reason that biopsies were not obtained. Of 281 single biopsies, only 4 (1.4%) had complications: pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement (n = 2), infection requiring admission (n = 1), and arrhythmia with hypotension (n = 1). All but one biopsy was successful in obtaining tissue. No deaths were attributable to biopsy.Conclusions:Our experience demonstrates that research biopsies in early phase clinical trials are safe (1.4% risk of serious complications), and a higher percentage of patients underwent mandatory biopsies (86.6%) compared with that of the patients with optional biopsies (4.4%).
