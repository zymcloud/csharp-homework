Aims:To evaluate the prognostic value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-a) and beta (PDGFR-ß) expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).?Methods:The expression of PDGFR-a, PDGFR-ß and VEGF in 63 HCC patients who underwent curative resection was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlations between the expression of these biomarkers and the clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Patient survival was analyzed by univariate analysis and Cox proportional hazards model.?Results:Univariate survival analysis showed that PDGFR-a or PDGFR-ß overexpression was of no prognostic significance in predicting disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (p>0.05), while VEGF overexpression and PDGFR-a/PDGFR-ß/VEGF coexpression were significantly correlated with worse DFS and poorer OS in HCC patients (pConclusions:Coexpression of PDGFR-a, PDGFR-ß and VEGF could be considered an independent prognostic biomarker for predicting DFS and OS in HCC patients. This result could be used to identify patients at a higher risk of tumor recurrence and poor prognosis, and help to select therapeutic schemes for the treatment of HCC.
