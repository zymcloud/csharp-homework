Background:This study aimed to evaluate the expression level of runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) in human primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and its relationship with the clinic pathological features.Methods:RUNX3 expression was analyzed by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting in HCC cells and tissues.Results:RUNX3 RNA and protein expression was decreased in HCC tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues (PConclusion:RUNX3 expression is deleted or decreased in HCCs and cell lines, in association with progression and prognosis.
