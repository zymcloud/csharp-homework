Background/aims:A high prevalence of serum IL-6 has been associated with the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in both animals and humans. However, it is not clear how the levels of serum IL-6 influence the prognosis of HCC patients. This study was carried out in order to attempt to answer this question.Methodology:A total of 156 adults were selected and categorized into four groups: healthy subjects (n=18), those with tumor recurrence (n=26), those initially diagnosed with HCC (n=32), and those with HCC (n=80) who received curative resection between 2002 and 2004 with five years of follow-up. Serum IL-6 levels were determined in all subjects by the same ELISA method.Results:IL-6 was found in high levels in the serum of patients initially diagnosed with HCC (8.47Â±5.92, pConclusions:High levels of serum IL-6 correlated positively with tumor size and with poor prognosis in HCC patients.
