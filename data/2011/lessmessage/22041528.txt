China has one of the highest carrier prevalences of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the world: nearly 10% of the general population. The disease burden of HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is also believed to be among the world's largest, and that of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is likely to be substantial as well. However, the epidemiology and measures to control HBV and HCV infection in China remain relatively unknown outside the country. We review the epidemiology of HBV and HCV infection, the disease burden of and risk factors for HCC, and current control measures against HBV and HCV infection in China. We also discuss the relevant literature and implications for future studies of hepatitis and HCC in China.
