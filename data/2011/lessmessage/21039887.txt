We followed the efficacy of long-term lamivudine monotherapy in preventing development of de novo hepatitis B (DNHB) in a large cohort of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative recipients with grafts from hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)-positive donors. Recipients were observed over a long follow-up. Between July 1999 and December 2008, 45 patients (median age 54, range 19-67) who were HBsAg negative before transplantation were included in the study of monoprophylaxis with lamivudine starting on post-operative day 1, and continuing for life. Mean follow-up: 37.9 months; median 32.1 months (range 2.4-117). No suspension of therapy was reported during the study. Post-transplantation, no DNHB was observed in follow-up: all 45 HBsAg-negative recipients remained HBsAg and HBV DNA negative. Thirty-four of these HBsAg-negative recipients were alive at conclusion of the study. A total of 11 patients died, five of HCV recurrence, two of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence, two of disseminated KSV infection, and two of multiorgan failure because of early graft dysfunction. Patient and graft survival of HBsAg-negative recipients with HBcAb-positive donor grafts (45 cases) were not significantly different from those of the HBsAg-negative recipients with HBcAb-negative donor grafts (302 cases). In our experience, lamivudine monoprophylaxis provided complete protection against HBV reactivation and showed long-term efficacy.
