Background:Silica nanoparticles have been discovered to exert cytotoxicity and induce apoptosis in normal human cells. However, until now, few studies have investigated the cytotoxicity of silica nanoparticles in tumor cells.Methods:This study investigated the cytotoxicity of 7-50 nm silica nanoparticles in human HepG2 hepatoma cells, using normal human L-02 hepatocytes as a control. Cell nucleus morphology changes, cellular uptake, and expression of procaspase-9, p53, Bcl-2, and Bax, as well as the activity of caspase-3, and intracellular reactive oxygen species and glutathione levels in the silica nanoparticle-treated cells, were analyzed.Results:The antitumor activity of the silica nanoparticles was closely related to particle size, and the antiproliferation activity decreased in the order of 20 nm > 7 nm > 50 nm. The silica nanoparticles were also cytotoxic in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, the silica nanoparticles showed only slight toxicity in the L-02 control cells, Moreover, in HepG2 cells, oxidative stress and apoptosis were induced after exposure to 7-20 nm silica nanoparticles. Expression of p53 and caspase-3 increased, and expression of Bcl-2 and procaspase-9 decreased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the expression of Bax was not significantly changed.Conclusion:A mitochondrial-dependent pathway triggered by oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species may be involved in apoptosis induced by silica nanoparticles, and hence cytotoxicity in human HepG2 hepatic cancer cells.
