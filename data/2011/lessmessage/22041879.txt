Hepatic angiomyolipoma is a rare hepatic mesenchymal tumor. We report a case of hepatic angiomyolipoma that was successfully resected along with a giant hemangioma. A 53-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation of a liver tumor in segment 4. The tumor was detected on positron emission tomography during a health check-up. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a well-defined mass of mixed echogenicity, 1.5 cm in diameter, in segment 4, and a giant hemangioma of mixed echogenicity, 7 cm in diameter, in segment 7. On enhanced computed tomography, the tumor in segment 4 showed hyperattenuation in the early phase and hypoattenuation in the delayed phase. On magnetic resonance imaging, the tumor in segment 4 showed hypointensity on T1-weighted images, hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, and hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images. On angiography, the tumor in segment 4 appeared as a circumscribed hypervascular mass in the early phase and a slightly hypovascular mass in the delayed phase. The imaging findings suggested a primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient consented to resection of the tumor in segment 4 along with the giant hemangioma in segment 7. These tumors were resected with tumor-free surgical margins by partial resection of segments 4 and 7 of the liver. The cut surface of the resected specimen of segment 4 showed a yellowish tumor consisting of mature adipose tissue. The histopathological diagnoses of the resected specimens were angiomyolipoma in segment 4 and cavernous hemangioma in segment 7. The tumor in segment 4 consisted of mature lipocytes with angiomatous and small lymphocytic components, but no mitotic figures. The tumor showed immunoreactivity to smooth muscle antigen and homatropine methylbromide 45 and no immunoreactivity to AE/E3. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient remains well 1 year after the operation.
