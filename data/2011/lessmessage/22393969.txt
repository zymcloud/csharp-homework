Aim:We conducted a case-control study in China to clarify the association between the XRCC1-Arg399Gln polymorphism and HCC risk.Methods:A total of 202 cases and 236 controls were selected from the the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from May 2008 to May 2010. Assessment of the XRCC1-Arg399Gln polymorphism was based upon duplex polymerase-chain-reactions with the confronting-two-pair primer (PCR- CTPP) method. All analyses were performed using the STATA statistical package.Results:A significant increase in risk was associated with the Arg/Gln genotype (adjusted OR 1.55, 95%CI=1.03-2.57) compared with Arg/ Arg. However, the Gln/Gln genotype had non-significant increased risk of HCC with adjusted OR (95%CI) of 1.34(0.67-2.38). There was also a significant increase with the Arg/Gln genotype among HCC patients above 50 years old (OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.14-3.57). Additionally, the risk of HCC was moderately increased in drinkers with Arg/Gln genotype compared with never drinkers, and the adjusted OR (95% CI) was 1.89 (1.13-3.45).Conclusion:This study demonstrated that a polymorphism in a DNA repair gene may influence the risk of HCC. The XRCC1 codon Arg/Gln was this associated with an increased risk of HCC, especially in patients above 50 years old and/or with a drinking habit.
