Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, in the SHARP trial (Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol trial) and the Asia-Pacific trial (conducted in the Asia-Pacific region), no cases of complete response (CR) were reported. Thereafter, only a relatively small number of CR cases were reported worldwide for sorafenib therapy. We herein report a case of CR in a patient treated with sorafenib for 4 months. The patient had advanced HCC with multiple lung metastases, and there has been no recurrence after 8 months following cessation of administration. To our knowledge, this is the first time a female treated with sorafenib alone for HCC has had a CR.
