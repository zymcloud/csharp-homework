Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common tumor worldwide and the leading cause of death amongst patients with cirrhosis. There are an estimated 500,000 or more new cases diagnosed each year in the world, with recent data suggesting an increase in incidence in the United State. Since the majority of HCC occurs in the setting of cirrhosis, an effective protocol for treatment needs to be in place addressing both management of underlying cirrhosis and cancer.
