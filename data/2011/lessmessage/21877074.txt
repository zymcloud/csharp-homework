Infection by hepatitis C virus constitutes an important health problem in Mexico. Diagnosis of high-risk population is essential given the probability of developing chronic disease, cirrhosis and cirrhosis decompensation, likely leading to the need of a liver transplant and/or the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the standard of care (SOC) treatment includes pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which have shown an approximately 57% rate response in genotype 1, the most prevalent in Mexico. It is known that between 30 and 60% of the infected population does not show a sustained virological response or cure. Therefore, in this article, we review existing therapeutic strategies in order to optimize the treatment. Future treatment strategies are also described. Eventually, it will be possible to add one or two molecules of the new directly acting antiviral drugs, to the SOC treatment. Each of them has a different action mechanism, and we are envisioning the possibility of an interferon-free therapy after 2015.
