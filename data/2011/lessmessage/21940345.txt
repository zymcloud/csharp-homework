Background/aims:Laminin-5 has been reported as a prognostic indicator of some malignancies. This prospective study aimed to elucidate the correlation between the ratio of the expression of different laminin-5 subchain mRNAs in HCC tissue and the clinical relevance or prognosis of patients.Methodology:Using RT-PCR, a3, ß3 and ?2 mRNA levels were determined prospectively from 29 patients with HCC undergoing curative resection. The ratio of the value of each subchain mRNA in HCC tissue to non-cancerous liver tissue was measured.Results:The mRNA of a3, ß3 and ß2 was detected in both HCC tissue and the liver remnants in 29 (100%), 29 (100%) and 28 (96.5%) patients, respectively. The ratio of ?2 mRNA correlated with the absence of complete encapsulation (p=0.033) and with the presence of hepatitis, with borderline significance (p=0.081). The ratio of a3 mRNA correlated with tumor hemorrhage and tumor necrosis with borderline significance (p=0.082 and p=0.082, respectively). The ratios of a3, ß3 and ?2 mRNA did not correlate significantly with postresection recurrence, recurrence and patient survival.Conclusions:Expression of a3, ß3 and ?2 cannot predict the prognosis. However, high expression of ?2 mRNA in HCC/non-cancerous liver correlated significantly with the absence of complete encapsulation, which is an important tumor invasiveness factor.
