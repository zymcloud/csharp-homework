Background/aims:Fine-powder cisplatin has recently been developed, allowing the easy manufacture of high-density cisplatin-lipiodol suspensions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with fine-powder cisplatin and lipiodol suspension against advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:We prospectively analyzed 20 patients (16 men, 4 women) with inoperative advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastases who underwent TACE with fine-powder cisplatin and lipiodol suspension in our hospital between August 2006 and December 2008. All patients were administered a suspension of fine-powder cisplatin at 10 mg/1 cm of tumor diameter.Results:Partial response was seen in 10 cases, with stable disease in 7 cases and progressive disease in 3 cases. Overall response rate was 50%. The 1-year survival rate was 90%. Adverse effects (> or = grade 3) occurred in 40%, with vomiting in 5%, thrombocytopenia in 15%, elevated serum bilirubin in 20%, decreased serum albumin in 5%, fever in 65%, general fatigue in 15% and anorexia in 30%. However, no other life-threatening, adverse events were observed.Conclusion:TACE with fine-powder cisplatin suspended in lipiodol provides better therapeutic efficacy, suggesting the potential usefulness of this agent in the treatment of advanced HCC.
