Objective:To clarify the diagnostic ability of combining imaging methods to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using Sonazoid®-enhanced ultrasound (US), gadolinium diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid-enhanced (Gd-EOB-DTPA) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT).Methods:A total of 32 patients who underwent surgical resection for HCC were studied. Sonazoid-enhanced US, Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI, CECT, and intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasonography were done for all patients. The definitive diagnosis of HCC in those patients was based on histopathological confirmation.Results:A total of 50 histologically proven HCCs were obtained from 32 patients; their mean (± SD) age was 68.3 years ± 8.1. The mean (± SD) nodule size was 2.6 cm ± 1.9. Twenty percent were well-differentiated HCC, 64% were moderately differentiated HCC, 10% were poorly differentiated HCC, 4% were combined HCC and CCC, and 2% were HCC with severe necrosis. The overall diagnostic sensitivity of CEUS, CECT, and Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI was 72, 74, and 86%, respectively; however, there was no significant difference between the three imaging modalities in diagnosing typical HCC (p = 0.092). When combining the diagnostic ability of the different imaging modalities, the diagnostic sensitivity of Sonazoid-enhanced US and Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI was 90%, while addition of Sonazoid-enhanced US to CECT and CECT to Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI had a sensitivity of 82 and 88%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the three imaging combinations (p = 0.970).Conclusion:Sonazoid-enhanced US and Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI can be confidently used in daily clinical practice for the management of HCC.
