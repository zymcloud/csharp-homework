Background/aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver. Radioembolization with yttrium-90 (Y90) microspheres is a new concept in radiation therapy for HCC. This review focuses on the indications, efficacy, side effects, and future direction of Y90 therapy, using TheraSphere® , in HCC patients.Results:Comprehensive literature reviews have described the clinical and scientific evidence of Y90 therapy. The Radioembolization Brachytherapy Oncology Consortium has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support the safe and effective use of this locoregional therapy in HCC patients, including those with portal vein thrombosis.Conclusions:There are currently no randomized clinical trials done on TheraSphere® and none of the studies so far have shown a survival benefit. Thus, although it represents a very promising therapy with excellent initial results, it cannot be fully recommended yet, till well-designed, large, randomized clinical studies are conducted showing survival benefits.
