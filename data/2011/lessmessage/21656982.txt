A common problem encountered with the chemotherapy or radiotherapy of cancer is the development of resistance to these treatments resulting in metastasis of the malignancy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new anti-cancer treatments that have a unique mechanism of action and are not prone to the development of drug or radiation resistance (1). Photothermal ablation (PTA) therapy is an emerging technique that uses heat produced from absorbed light to destroy cancer cells. PTA therapy can be performed frequently, has no side effects, and does not promote the development of resistance (1). For PTA therapy, near-infrared (NIR) light is used to deliver a predetermined amount of photothermal energy directly into a tumor, which stimulates photochemical and photothermal reactions within the malignant lesion that are fatal for the cancer cells (2). In addition, the application of PTA in the presence of a light-absorbing nanoparticles (NPs), such as gold NPs (shells, rods, and cages) or copper sulfide (CuS) NPs, has been shown to enhance efficacy of the therapy (3). However, many parameters, such as the dose of NIR required to maximize the efficacy of PTA therapy, the number of NPs required for optimal ablation, or how to monitor the treatment noninvasively, remain to be worked out (1).Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography are currently used to monitor morphological changes that occur after PTA therapy, but alterations in the tissue are visible with these techniques for only 2–3 months after initiation of the treatment (1). It is well known that 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) is often used with positron emission tomography (PET) to assess the response to cancer therapy, but this imaging modality generates reliable results for only 2–3 weeks after initiation of the treatment. In addition, [18F]-FDG can generate false-positive results because it also detects inflammation, sarcoidosis, and fungal and tuberculosis infections (lesions from these conditions show an upregulated glucose metabolism similar to that of cancer cells) (1, 4). Hypericin, a naturally occurring polycyclic quinone that can be isolated from the plant Hypericum perforatum or chemically synthesized, has been investigated for the photodynamic therapy of cancer and other conditions (5). Although the exact mechanism of action of this compound is not known, several reports suggest that multiple cellular pathways participating in the survival, necrosis, or apoptosis of the cell are involved in bringing about the activity of hypericin as discussed elsewhere (5, 6). Hypericin is considered a nonporphyrin agent that binds to necrotic tissues, and 123I-labeled hypericin has been shown to detect tissue necrosis in the liver and the heart [PubMed]. Song et al. synthesized 64Cu-labeled bis-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N,N'-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-conjugated hypericin ([64Cu]-bis-DOTA-hypericin) and used it to evaluate the response of xenograft human BT474 breast carcinoma cell tumors in nude mice subjected to PTA treatment in presence of copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS NPs) (1). The biodistribution of [64Cu]-bis-DOTA-hypericin was also investigated in these animals.
