Sterigmatocystin (STC) is a wide spread mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus fungi, with hepatotoxic and carcinogenetic proprieties.Objectives:To determine the STC concentration in blood and urine from patient with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with correlation with liver function parameters.Material and methods:The study enrolled 166 patients divided in three groups: control--55 patients (27M, 28F); LC--58 patients (31M, 27F); HCC--53 patients (26M, 27F). 20 ml of blood and 50 ml of urine were collected from each patient and liver enzymes and alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) were measured. STC was determined by high performance liquid chromatography, with concomitant detection in ultraviolet and fluorescence.Results:STC was detected in 26.2% of samples, more frequently in LC and HCC groups (p Conclusions:STC values in patients with LC and HCC were significantly higher compared to controls. Strong positive correlation of STC with AFP in patients with liver cancer suggested a possible role of this mycotoxin in pathogenesis of the disease.
