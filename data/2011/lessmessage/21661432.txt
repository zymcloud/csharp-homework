Background/aims:Survival predictors in patients with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by transarterial embolization (TAE), have not been fully investigated.Methodology:Predictors of short-term (30 days) survival were evaluated by using the logistic regression model and the Cox proportional hazard model, respectively.Results:Forty-eight patients treated by emergency TAE were enrolled. The median survival time was 231 days. Although hemostasis was attained by TAE in 44 patients (91.7%), 15 patients (31.3%) died within 30 days. In a multivariate analysis, low serum creatinine level (p=0.018) was the only significant predictor of increased short-term survival. Of the 33 patients who survived more than 30 days after TAE, he patic resection was performed in 8, transarterial chemoembolization or chemotherapy in 8, and conservative treatment in 17. In a multivariate analysis, among the 33 who survived, unilateral location of tumors (p=0.041) and low a-fetoprotein level (p=0.004) were significant predictors of increased long-term survival.Conclusions:Short-term survival of patients with ruptured HCC who were treated by TAE depended on serum creatinine level on arrival. Long-term survival of patients who survived more than 30 days after TAE, was influenced by tumor location and a-fetoprotein level.
