The article presents a clinical case of mucinous adenocarcinoma in vivo diagnosis of vermiform appendix with metastasis in the navel. Neoplasms vermiform appendix--an extremely rare tumor pathology: the total share of all malignant tumors are less than 1%. Mucinous carcinoma is a rare tumor, according to various authors the frequency of its occurrence ranges from 3 to 10% of all malignancies. By Localization mucinous carcinoma more frequently is found in the colon and rectum (about 20% of cases), ovary (5-10% of all malignant ovarian tumors), stomach, uterus and also in the pancreas (only about 2%). Metastasis in the navel is a very rare disease and is known as Sister Mary Joseph's Nodule, the primary site often localized in the digestive tract (52%), much less--in the female reproductive organs (28%), unspecified localization is approximately 15-20% of cases. The difficulty of diagnosis in the present case was that, in spite of life conducted during survey of the colon, organic pathology was not identified. The presence of hepatosplenomegaly and ascites at the initial examination gave cause to the erroneous diagnostic conception of the presence of liver cirrhosis. It is also was not paid due attention to the presence of changes in the umbilical ring, which were regarded as an umbilical hernia. To verify the diagnosis allowed the infiltrate biopsy of the umbilical region, followed by histological examination of the preparation and identification of a characteristic picture of mucinous cancers.
