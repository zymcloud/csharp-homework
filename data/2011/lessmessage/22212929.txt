Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant tumor responsible for approximately 600,000-700,000 deaths worldwide, and it is becoming more prevalent not only in Southeast Asia and Africa but also in Western countries; therefore, interest in hepatocellular carcinoma has mounted in recent years in the West, where little or no interest was evident 10-20 years ago.
