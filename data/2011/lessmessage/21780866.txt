Objective:To improve the therapeutic index of brucine, the novel stealth liposomes (SLS-n), composed of naturally unsaturated and hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholines, with significant difference of phase transition temperature, were developed to encapsulate brucine.Methods:Brucine-loaded stealth liposomes with different lipid compositions were prepared and characterized for their entrapment efficiency (EE), particle size, zeta potential and in vitro drug release profile. Tissue distribution after intravenous administration of different brucine formulations was further compared in tumor-bearing mice.Results:Compared with the conventional stealth liposomes composed of SPC (SLS-s) or HSPC (SLS-h), EE and zeta potential of SLS-n were increased slightly, and the size was decreased slightly. The results of drug release showed that SLS-n were more stable than SLS-s. After intravenous administration, tumor AUC in SLS-s, SLS-n and SLS-h treated animals were 1.33, 1.72 and 2.59-fold higher than in mice treated with the same dose of free brucine, respectively. Compared with brucine solution, administration of SLS-s and SLS-n could significantly decrease brucine concentration in brain, but administration of SLS-h resulting in significantly increased (2.75-fold) concentration in 10 min.Conclusion:Since brucine has severe central nervous system toxicity, our study indicated that SLS-n could considerably improve the therapeutic index of brucine.
