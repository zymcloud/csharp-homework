Although potentially curative therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are well established, they are offered only to a limited number of patients. For advanced HCC, sorafenib is now the treatment of choice. Radiotherapy technology has evolved remarkably during the past decade and can be precisely delivered, thereby permitting higher doses to the tumor and reduced doses to surrounding normal tissues. According to the Korean Liver Cancer Study Group (KLCSG) practice guidelines, radiation therapy is considered appropriate for unresectable, locally advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis, Child-Pugh class A or B, and tumors occupying less than two thirds of the liver with level II evidence. In this review, we discuss the radiotherapeutic strategies for each clinical setting in patients with HCC.
