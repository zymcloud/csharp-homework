Hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) is an important co-factor in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We studied whether quantitative HBV DNA at time of HCC detection influences survival of HCC patients. All diagnosed HCC cases between 2000 and 2008 at our university-based reference centre were analysed to determine the influence of hepatitis B viral load on overall survival. Clinical and virological findings were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses, survival rates were assessed for HCC patients with a high viral load (HBV DNA â‰¥10(5) copies/ml) and low viral load (HBV DNA
