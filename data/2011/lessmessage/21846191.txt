Purpose:The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the technical efficacy and survival following CT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver metastases (LM) from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and to determine prognostic factors.Materials and methods:Between 2000 and 2008, 376 patients with LM from NPC were identified. Of these 17 patients with 31 LM from NPC underwent CT-guided percutaneous RFA. We assessed the technical effectiveness, complications and prognostic value of LM characteristics including timing (synchronous versus metachronous), number, size, presence of extra hepatic metastases and treatment regimen. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Technical success was achieved in 30/31 metastases (96.7%). The median overall survival was 16.5 months from the time of diagnosis of LM for all the 376 NPC patients with LM, and 48.1 months for the 17 NPC patients with LM who received RFA treatment. Of the 376 patients, 111 had 1-3 LM who did not receive RFA treatment, with a median survival of 25.9 months compared to 48.1 months for the 14 patients with 1-3 LM who received RFA.Conclusion:CT-guided RFA of LM from NPC can be performed with a high degree of technical effectiveness and offers the promise of improved survival in selected patients.
