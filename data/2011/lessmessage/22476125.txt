Objective:To determine the diagnostic value of colonoscopy indications as predictors of colorectal cancer (CRC).Methods:A retrospective study of colonoscopy indications in Centenary Peruvian Japanese Clinic from 2006 to 2010 was performed. Diagnosis of CRC was considered as dependent variable whereas colonoscopy indications were considered as independent variables. For each indication we calculated the sensitivity (S), positive predictive value (PPV), positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and number of colonoscopies needed to diagnose a case of CRC (NND).Results:Of the 2290 colonoscopies analyzed, 58 (2.5%) had colorectal cancer, with a mean age of 66.5 ¬Å} 12.4 years (range 27-84) of whom 89.7% were older than 50 years. The indications with greatest PPV were abdominal tumor (20.0%), liver metastases (16.7%), hematochezia (12.2%), suspicious radiological image (10.0%), constitutional syndrome (8.3%) and anemia (7.9%). The indications with greatest LR+ were liver abdominal tumor (9.62), liver metastases (7.70), hematoquezia (5.33), suspicious radiological image (4.28), (3.5) and anemia (3.31). The NND was 5 in hematoquezia and 10 in anemia, while others indications had negative NND or no significant.Conclusions:Indications of abdominal tumor, liver metastases, non-distal rectal bleeding, suspicious radiological image, constitutional syndrome and anemia were associated with colorectal cancer diagnosis. Non-distal rectal bleeding and anemia had adequate NND in diagnosis of colorectal cancer.
