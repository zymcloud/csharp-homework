Hepatocellular carcinoma is a main challenge in oncologic care. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment. Transarterial chemoembolization is the most widely used palliative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. The Authors present a case report of a 61-year old man with hepatocellular carcinoma, belonging to Child-Pugh class A. The advanced age and the previous history of bladder carcinoma made the patient not suitable for liver transplantation. The patient refused hepatic resection so that transarterial chemoembolization was proposed. During 14-year follow-up there was intrahepatic progression of the tumor after the first treatment, followed by reduction in size and number of the lesions after subsequent treatments. In spite of the ominous prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, in this case-report transarterial chemoembolization allowed us to achieve a unique long-term survival.
