Identification and treatment of advanced hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is often challenging. Accurate fibrosis staging can be performed only by liver biopsy. For patients with advanced fibrosis (Metavir score, F3 or F4), progression to decompensated liver disease occurs at a rate of approximately 5% per year and progression to hepatocellular carcinoma occurs at a rate of 1% to 2% per year. Liver decompensation primarily results from altered hepatic blood flow caused by liver scarring and is characterized by ascites and its complications (hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic hydrothorax, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding varices, and coagulopathy. Patients with advanced fibrosis need to be regularly monitored for evidence of decompensated disease, and complications need to be aggressively managed. This article summarizes a presentation by Kenneth E. Sherman, MD, at the IAS-USA live continuing medical education course, Management of Hepatitis C Virus in the New Era, held in New York City in April 2011.
