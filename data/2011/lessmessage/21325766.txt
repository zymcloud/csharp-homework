Here we describe a 73-year-old woman with hypercalcemia caused by a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) secreting intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Serum tumor markers and dynamic CT findings indicated a diagnosis of HCC. The source of the elevated serum iPTH was not obvious. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was effective against the HCC, and the serum iPTH level fell to within the normal range, suggesting a correlation between the carcinoma and the iPTH. About 2 months later, the tumor had grown and the serum calcium level increased leading to physical deterioration and death. This clinical course suggested that HCC can ectopically secrete iPTH.
