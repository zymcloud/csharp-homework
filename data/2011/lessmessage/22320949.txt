Dietary flavonoids have attracted attention as chemopreventive agents. Chalcones are abundantly present in nature starting from ferns to higher plants. Chemically 1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ones, these are often cytotoxic in vitro. The cellular defense system (including glutathione, glutathione-related enzymes, and antioxidant and redox enzymes) plays a crucial role in cell survival and growth in aerobic organisms. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the modulatory effect of trans-chalcone on protection from oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Cell growth was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2- yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Sub-toxic concentrations of compound (20 uM) increased cell survival and a decreased lipid peroxidation. The drug also decreased the H2O2 induction of glutathione related enzymes. Our results support the efficacy of trans-chalcone in offering protection against oxidative stress.
