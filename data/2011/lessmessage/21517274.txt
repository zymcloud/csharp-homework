Background:Having a family history (FH) of cancer is recognized as one of the most important factors in predicting personal cancer risk. Since reports on cancer FH from developing countries are limited, the present study was conducted to provide a first report on the prevalence of familial cancers in Iran.Methods:Cross-sectional analysis performed on self-reported FH of cancers based on data from a large population based study in Tehran, the capital of Iran. Each participant was shown a list of site-specific cancers and asked if a relative had been diagnosed with any cancer on the list, completing the question by specifying the age of diagnosis.Results:Stomach cancer (4.6%) was the most common condition noted for family members, followed by the cancers of the breast (4.2%), lung (3.5%), liver (3.1%), leukemia (3.0) and colorectum (2.8%). The most frequent cancer reported by the responders was breast (1.8%) in first degree relatives (FDR) and stomach (1.8%) and stomach (2.8%) in second degree relatives (SDR). A FH of cancer was more commonly reported by younger persons and females. Of all respondents with a positive FH, 28.2% had at least one affected person diagnosed at age under 50 years in their FDRs.Conclusion:A substantial proportion of individuals in the Iran report having a family member affected by cancer, and thus may be recommended for early cancer screening services.
