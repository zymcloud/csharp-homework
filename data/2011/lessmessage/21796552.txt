Background/aims:Diffuse or continuous multifocal tumors with accompanying portal vein thrombosis yield considerable changes in the magnetic resonance imaging findings of hepatocellular carcinoma. The overlapped imaging findings of these two co-existing pathologies may be confusing. We aimed to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging findings of widespread hepatocellular carcinoma lesions complicated with portal vein thrombosis.Methods:Twenty-two patients (20 male, 2 female; mean age: 57 years) with portal vein thrombosis and diffuse-type hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent contrast-enhanced hepatic magnetic resonance imaging in our department between August 2001 and November 2008 were evaluated retrospectively. The unenhanced axial T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast early- and late-phase images were reviewed in each patient.Results:On T2-weighted magnetic resonance images, tumors were seen mildly hyperintense in 11 patients and heterogeneously hyperintense in 11 patients. Unenhanced T1-weighted images demonstrated homogeneous hypointensity in 15 patients and heterogeneous hypointensity in 7 patients. Post-contrast early-phase magnetic resonance images showed patchy enhancement in 12 patients, moth-eaten enhancement in 6 patients, strong enhancement in 1 patient, and minimal enhancement in 3 patients. Post-contrast late-phase magnetic resonance images demonstrated heterogeneous washout in all patients. Portal vein thrombosis was present in all patients. The mean diameter of main portal vein thrombi was 27 mm (range: 25-30 mm). Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were elevated in all patients.Conclusions:In patients with chronic parenchymal liver disease, when portal vein thrombosis and high serum alpha-fetoprotein values co-exist, careful attention must be paid to the hepatic parenchymal changes, especially on contrast-enhanced images, in order to not overlook diffuse-type hepatocellular carcinoma.
