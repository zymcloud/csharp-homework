This work aimed to investigate the correlation of the expression of α-fetoprotein (AFP) and glypican-3 (GPC3) mRNAs in the peripheral blood with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and HCC metastasis by using multiple fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (FQ-RT-PCR). Peripheral blood samples from 100 patients with HCC were collected. The positive expression rates of AFP mRNA of HCC, hepatitis B, and cirrhosis patients were 56, 5, and 10%, respectively. AFP mRNA was not detected in healthy subjects, hepatic hemangioma, or hepatic metastasis patients' samples. Those of GPC3 mRNA of HCC patients were 76%. GPC3 mRNA was not detected in healthy subjects, hepatitis B, cirrhosis, hepatic hemangioma, or hepatic metastasis patients' samples. In HCC patients' samples, the combined positive rate of AFP and GPC3 mRNA expressions was 81%. The relative expression levels of GPC3 mRNA in the metastasis group and nonmetastasis group were 0.98±0.38 and 0.72±0.26, respectively, and showed significantly different (P=0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in the AFP mRNA expression levels (P=0.134). In conclusion, the sensitivity of HCC diagnosis can be improved by combined detection of AFP and GPC3 mRNA expressions. GPC3 mRNA is HCC-specific, and may indicate HCC metastasis.
