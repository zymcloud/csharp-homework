Background and objectives:This study examined whether variation in exonic and flanking sequences of the human HLA-F adjacent transcript 10 (FAT10) gene might be associated with susceptibility and clinicopathological development of hapatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 522 subjects, including 268 healthy controls and 254 patients with HCC, were recruited. Genotyping was accomplished using DNA sequencing. Haplotypes were determined through genotypic and disequilibrium analysis of identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).Results:Ten SNPs in FAT10 were identified, namely -143 A/G (rs362535), -121 A/G (rs2272991), +3446 C/T, +3476 T/C (rs2076484), +3527 T/C (rs2076485), +3607 T/C (rs2076486), +3620 C/G (rs2076487), +3803 C/G (rs8337), +3809 G/T (rs7757931), +3833 G/C (rs444013). +3446 C/T is a novel polymorphism. The -143 A/G, -121 A/G, +3476 T/C, +3607 T/C, +3620 C/G and +3809 G/T genotypes were associated with a decreased risk for HCC (all P-values 0.05). Furthermore, under the analysis of haplotype, GGCTCGT and AGCTCGT were related to reduced HCC risk (OR=0.41, 95%CI=0.24, 0.70, PConclusion:This study provides first evidence that FAT10 gene genetic variants may be involved in the susceptibility and clinicopathological development of HCC in the Chinese Han population.
