Objectives:To carry out a phase II multi-center study on the efficacy and safety of triple combination therapy with paclitaxel, S-1, and cisplatin in patients with unresectable/metastatic gastric cancer.Methods:A total of 63 patients from 8 institutions were included in this study. Paclitaxel (160 mg/m²) was administered by infusion for 3 h on the first day. S-1 (70 mg/m²/day) was administered orally for 14 consecutive days from the first day. Cisplatin (60 mg/m²) was administered intravenously over 24 h on day 14 of every 28-day cycle.Results:All 63 patients were assessed for clinical efficacy and safety. A total of 259 cycles of treatment were administered (median 4, range 1-10). Grade 3-4 toxicities included neutropenia in 30.2%, thrombocytopenia in 12.7%, and anemia in 11.1%. There was no grade 3-4 non-hematological toxicity or treatment-related death. Complete response was observed in 6 patients and partial response in 34 patients. The overall response rate was 63.5%. The median progression-free survival and response duration were 8.0 and 8.8 months, respectively, and median survival time was 15 months.Conclusions:Triple combination therapy with paclitaxel, S-1, and cisplatin showed promising safety and efficacy profiles with the potential to become a standard regimen for unresectable/metastatic gastric cancer.
