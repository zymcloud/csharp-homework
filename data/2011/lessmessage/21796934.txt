A series of 1-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-3-(substituted)-2-propen-1-one and its 1-methyl analogues 2c-h were synthesized and cyclized with different reagents such as ethyl cyanoacetate, thiourea, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, guanidinium sulfate, methylhydrazine, phenylhydrazine and/or hydrogen peroxide in different reactions to produce pyridones 3a,b, pyrimidinethione 4a,b, isoxazole 5a,b, aminopyrimidine 6a,b, pyrazoline 7i-k and epoxy derivative 8, respectively. Acetohydrazide 10 reacted with formic acid, acetic anhydride, carbon disulfide and/or thiosemicarbazide to yield compounds 11-19. Also compound 21a,b was condensed with different monosaccharides to yield the corresponding N-glycoside Schiff's bases derivatives 22a-h, which upon treatment with acetic anhydride afforded 23a-h derivatives. The anticancer activity of some of the newly synthesized compounds was evaluated against HEPG2 (human liver carcinoma cell line) and PC12 (pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla) cells. Benzimidazole-2-isoxazole 5a derivative exhibited high potency against HEPG2 and PC12 cells. Benzimidazole chalcones 2c,e, benzimidazole mercaptoacetohydrazide 14 and benzimidazole thiosemicarbazide 15a,b derivatives gave high potency against PC12 cells.
