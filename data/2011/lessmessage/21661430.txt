Background/aims:Diabetes mellitus (DM) is prevalent in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but its effects on post-radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have not been elucidated. This study aims to determine whether DM significantly impacts the outcomes in patients with HCC after RFA.Methodology:This retrospective study included 161 HCC patients successfully treated with RFA. Intra-hepatic HCC recurrence and survival were analysed.Results:No significant difference was found for 1-, 2-, 3- year's intra-hepatic HCC recurrence rates (DM: 45%, 61%, 74% vs. non-DM: 42%, 62%, 75%;p=0.935) and survival rates (DM: 83%, 80%, 73% vs. non-DM: 92%, 84%, 79%; p=0.218) between diabetics (53 patients) and non-diabetics (108 patients). In subgroup analysis of viral etiology and HCC, no significant difference was noted for intra-hepatic HCC recurrence or survival in hepatitis B virus-related or hepatitis C virus-related HCC. Multivariate analysis showed only persistent hepatitis influenced intra-hepatic HCC recurrence (p=0.021) and survival (p=0.022).Conclusion:DM may not affect the intra-hepatic HCC recurrence and survival in patients with HCC after RFA. However, persistent hepatitis after RFA may affect intra-hepatic HCC recurrence and survival.
