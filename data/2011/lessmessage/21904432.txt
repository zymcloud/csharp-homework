Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading source of liver diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we use computation methods in order to improve our understanding of the complex interactions that occur between molecules related to Hepatitis B virus (HBV). Due to the complexity of the disease and the numerous molecular players involved, we devised a method to construct a systemic network of interactions of the processes ongoing in patients affected by HBV. The network is based on high-throughput data, refined semi-automatically with carefully curated literature-based information. We find that some nodes in the network that prove to be topologically important, in particular HBx is also known to be important target protein used for the treatment of HBV. Therefore, HBx protein is the preferential choice for inhibition to stop the proteolytic processing. Hence, the 3D structure of HBx protein was downloaded from PDB. Ligands for the active site were designed using LIGBUILDER. The HBx protein's active site was explored to find out the critical interactions pattern for inhibitor binding using molecular docking methodology using AUTODOCK Vina. It should be noted that these predicted data should be validated using suitable assays for further consideration.
