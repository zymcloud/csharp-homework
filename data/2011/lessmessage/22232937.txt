This study examines the immunomodulating effect of cytostatic drug--cyclophosphamide (Cy)--on natural cytotoxic activity of rats and mice splenocytes. The cytotoxicity of the effector cells against the confluent monolayer cell lines of rat hepatoma Zajdela and HTC and mice hepatoma MH-22a was estimated by means the morphometric analysis. It was shown, that 48 h after single intraperitoneal injection of Cy produced a immunomodulating effect on the activity of splenocytes--suppressor action on cells of Zajdela hepatoma and immunopotentiating action on the target cells of HTC and MH-22a hepatomas. The possible mechanisms of immunopotentiating effect of Cy are discussed.
