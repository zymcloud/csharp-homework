The Hong Kong cancer registry was established in 1963, and cancer registration is done by passive and active methods. The registry contributed data on 45 cancer sites or types registered during 1996-2001 for this survival study. Follow-up has been carried out by passive methods with median follow-up ranging from 4-60 months. The proportion of cases with histologically verified cancer diagnosis ranged from 38-100%; death certificates only (DCOs) ranged from 0-11%; 83-99% of total registered cases were included for survival analysis. The 5-year age-standardized relative survival exceeded 100% for lip and non-melanoma skin followed by thyroid (94%) and testicular (92%) cancers. The corresponding survival for common cancers were breast (90%), colon (61%), liver and Lung (22%), nasopharynx (70%), rectum (59%) and stomach (39%). The 5-year relative survival by age group showed a decreasing trend with increasing agegroups for most cancers. A decreasing survival with increasing clinical extent of disease was noted.
