In Taiwan, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been the leading cause of cancer incidence and mortality in recent decades. The majority of patients have hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The HBV carrier rate and incidence of HCC in children have declined with the implementation of a hepatitis B vaccination program for newborns since 1984. A combination of Î±-fetoprotein and ultrasonography (US) has been used for surveillance in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection in intervals of 3-6 and 6-12 months for cirrhosis and chronic liver disease, respectively. A secular survival improvement in HCC patients has been demonstrated. A reasonable screening protocol should include two stages. The first stage is identification of high-risk subjects and the second stage is US screening of high-risk subjects. Community-based HCC screening programs have been conducted for more than two decades in Taiwan. The commonly used first-stage markers are HBsAg and anti-HCV, while the platelet count should be a useful marker in HCV-endemic communities. The benefit of HCC screening was shown by a prolonged overall survival. However, this was limited to the early curable stage in elderly subjects. Prevention and control of HCC have multiple modalities. Identification of a high-risk group for active surveillance, effective antiviral treatment for chronic HBV and HCV infection, and early detection and prompt treatment of HCC should decrease the sequelae of HCC in Taiwan.
