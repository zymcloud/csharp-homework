Background:Melanoma antigen (MAGE)-A4 is processed to generate a C-terminal fragment with proapoptotic activity. Here we demonstrate that Adriamycin promotes generation of the processed MAGE-A4 by activating the proteasome. The proteasome is known to prevent accumulation of toxic proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis.Methods and results:Treatment of hepatoma cells expressing MAGE-A4 with a sublethal dose of Adriamycin increased the MAGE-A4 processing and sensitized the cells to Adriamycin-induced apoptosis. The processing of MAGE-A4 was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitors MG115, MG132, lactacystin and epoxamicin. MAGE-A4 was coimmunoprecipitated with the S6 proteasomal ATPase, and present in the fractions containing the proteasome during glycerol gradient centrifugation. Consistent with the notion that the proteasome cleaves MAGE-A4, the 26S proteasome, ubiquitin, and cell lysates were necessary for efficient in vitrocleavage of MAGE-A4.Conclusions:The present study suggests that a low dose of Adriamycin increases the proteasome activity, which either maintains cellular homeostasis or leads to apoptosis depending, at least under the present conditions, on the expression of MAGE-A4.
