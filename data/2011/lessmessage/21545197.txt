Objective:To evaluate the role of Immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the diagnosis of metastatic liver disease, with a descriptive, cross-sectional study at the Department of Histopathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Rawalpindi.Material and methods:A total of 130 cases of metastatic liver disease were retrieved from the tumor registry data. Eosin-haematoxylin stained sections and Immunohistochemistry panels applied to ascertain the site of primary tumor were evaluated. The panels of detailed immunohistochemical markers were applied. Frequency and percentages were calculated for qualitative variables. Mean and standard deviations were calculated for quantitative variables.Results:Males were 87 (67%) and were females 43 (33.07%). The most common site of primary was in GIT (45%), followed by neuroendocrine carcinoma and gall bladder. The other less common sites were lung, breast, ovary and thyroid.Conclusion:There is no specific singular panel of immunohistochemistry markers which can be used in all cases of metastatic liver tumors. The best use and selection of IHC markers depend upon morphological features, clinical history and results of other relevant investigations.
