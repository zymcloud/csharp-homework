Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is only cleared in a minority of infected individuals, the majority of patients develop chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection potentially leads to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. The host immune response is an important determinant in the outcome of HCV infection. Innate as well as adaptive cellular and humoral immune responses mediate important antiviral actions; however, virus-specific T cell responses appear to be most critical. Indeed, strong and multispecific CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cell responses are required for viral clearance. Interestingly, individuals who express certain HLA alleles (which are important for antigen presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) have a higher chance to clear the virus. The mechanisms of protection by HLA class I alleles such as HLA-B27 have been characterized recently. In most individuals, however, the HCV-specific immune response fails to clear the virus. Several mechanisms underlying this HCV-specific T cell failure have been identified. These include viral factors such as viral escape mutations and immunological factors such as the expression of inhibitory receptors, which lead to CD8+ T cell dysfunction. An in-depth understanding of the determinants of success or failure of the HCV-specific T cell response is critical for the development of prophylactic as well as therapeutic vaccination regimes against HCV. Here, we will discuss the virological and immunological determinants of HCV clearance and persistence.
