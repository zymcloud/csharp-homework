A 60-year-old male patient with an unknown cause for cirrhosis and a hepatoma underwent an ABO incompatible living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) from his son. The transplanted graft was his son's right lobe. For ABO incompatible transplantation, splenectomy was performed for desensitization. A catheter was inserted into the recipient's right hepatic artery for subsequent local immunosuppression. On the 15th postoperative day, a fusiform 15 Ã— 10 mm aneurysm was observed in the graft right hepatic artery using ultrasonography and hepatic arteriography. At that time, the patient was also diagnosed to have an intraperitoneal abscess at the bottom of his left diaphragm. Administering antibiotics, we tried to embolize the aneurysm because of fear of rupture, but this manever failed because it was difficult to insert the wire in to the aneurysm to produce a stenosis around its proximal neck. However, because the aneurysm was not detectable on the 37th postoperative day, it was assumed to have embolized spontaneously. This relatively rare case revealed a hepatic artery aneurysm that spontaneously regressed after ABO incompatible LDLT.
