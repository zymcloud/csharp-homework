A novel block ionomer complex micelles as drug carrier is developed utilizing self-assemble of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(acrylic acid) (PEG-b-PAA) and cadmium chloride. This micelles are characterized to be have good bio-compatibility, hydrophilicity, passive targeting and sustained slow release property which shows great potential for liver cancer therapy. Block ionomer complex micelles based on PEG-b-PAA and cadmium chloride can self-assemble in distilled water, and Cd(Â²+) agent is entrapped into the core stabilized by PEG shells. Results showed the block ionomer complex micelles to be spherically shaped. Cadmium was incorporated easily into the ionic core with remarkably high efficiency (34.25% weight (wt)/wt). The cadmium-loaded polymeric micelles exhibited sustained and slow release behavior of cadmium and a potent cytotoxicity against SMMC-7721 in vitro. This novel block ionomer complex micelles with cores of metal antitumor drug indicates to be potential carriers for effective drug delivery.
