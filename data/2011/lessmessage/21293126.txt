Background:Splenectomy is gaining increasing importance for cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism. However, its safety and efficacy for patients with chronic liver disease remain unclear.Methods:We retrospectively examined the medical records of 38 consecutive cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy or simultaneous hepatectomy and splenectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:White blood cell and platelet counts significantly increased 3 months after splenectomy. Serum levels of total bilirubin and prothrombin time significantly improved 1 year after splenectomy. Interferon therapy was administered to 25 patients after splenectomy. A sustained viral response was achieved in 8 patients (42%). The total incidence of portal or splenic vein thrombosis (PSVT) detected by postoperative dynamic computed tomography was 13/38 (34.2%). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative spleen volume (SV) to be the sole independent predictor of postoperative PSVT. Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis showed that a cut-off SV of 450 ml corresponded to a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 56%.Conclusions:Splenectomy improved the liver function and facilitated effective interferon therapy in cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism, although preoperative SV was frequently associated with postoperative PSVT.
