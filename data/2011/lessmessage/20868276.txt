Cancer is increasingly recognized as a complication of HIV infection in both resource-rich and resource-limited areas. The traditional AIDS-defining cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma, cervical cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, have become common comorbidities afflicting HIV-positive individuals and lack adequate prevention and management options. Additionally, several non-AIDS-defining cancers have increased in incidence in resource-limited regions, including Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung cancer. This review outlines the epidemiology of HIV-associated malignancies in resource-poor and resource-rich areas, including the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy on the incidence of these cancers. The pathogenesis of HIV-associated cancers is considered in relation to potential strategies for their prevention and treatment.
