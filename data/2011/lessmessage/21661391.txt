Background/aims:To analyze the distribution of coagulation parameters in patients with primary liver cancer; explore the relationship between clinical staging, survival, and coagulation parameters by using Coxproportional hazard model; and provide a parameter for clinical management and prognosis.Methodology:Coagulation parameters were evaluated in 228 patients with primary liver cancer, 52 patients with common liver disease, and 52 normal healthy controls. The relationship between primary livercancer staging and coagulation parameters wasanalyzed. Follow-up examinations were performed. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the relationship between coagulationparameters and survival.Results:The changes in the coagulation parameters in patients with primary liver cancer were significantly different from those in normal controls. The effect of the disease on coagulation function became more obvious as the severity of liver cancer increased (p<0.05). The levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), fibrinogen (FIB), and platelets (PLT) were negatively correlated with the long-term survival of patients with advanced liver cancer.Conclusions:The stages of primary liver cancer are associated with coagulation parameters. Coagulation parameters are related to survival and risk factors. Monitoring of coagulation parameters may help ensure better surveillance and treatment for liver cancer patients.
