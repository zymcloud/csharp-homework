Background:The epidemiology and clinical characteristics of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in South America are not well known. Brazil is a largest country in this part of the world and the present study aimed to contribute with this information.Methods:This descriptive study included patients from medical centers around Brazil, who had diagnosis of NAFLD. They were selected from chart review and also prospectively in Hepatology out-clinics. Patients with history of alcohol intake and others liver diseases were excluded. Histological diagnosis included: steatosis or steatohepatitis (steatosis, ballooning of hepatocytes or fibrosis). The criteria to perform a liver biopsy was ALT or AST > 1.5 x normal levels.Results:A total of 1280 patients from 16 Brazilian centers and all five regions were included. The mean age was 49.68 Â± 13.59 years; 53.3% were males and 85% were asymptomatic. Hyperlipidemia was observed in 66.8% cases, obesity in 44.7%, overweight in 44.4%, diabetes in 22.7%, and toxins exposure in 10%. Metabolic syndrome was observed in 41.3% cases. Elevated levels of ALT, AST and GGT were observed in 55.8%, 42.2% and 63.1% cases, respectively. Liver biopsy performed in 437 cases showed: isolate steatosis in 42% cases, steatohepatitis in 58% and 27% of them also presented fibrosis. Cirrhosis was observed in 15.4% and hepatocellular carcinoma in 0.7%.Conclusions:NAFLD in Brazil is more frequent in asymptomatic males; steatohepatitis with fibrosis and cirrhosis were a significant diagnosis. The genetic predisposition and lifestyle should be influenced in the spectrum; however these findings deserve a future investigation.
