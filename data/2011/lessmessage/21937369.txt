Background/aims:Patients with abdominal symptoms and leukocytosis or elevated C-reactive protein were subjected to abdominal ultrasonography (US) for correct diagnosis.Methodology:Patients with abdominal symptoms, leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein were enrolled. Those with abnormal liver enzymes or radiographs were excluded since either of them might be a clue to proper diagnosis, such as hepatobiliary diseases or bowel obstruction.Results:Total number of patients was 38. Number of acute diverticulitis, colitis, acute appendicitis and enteritis were 8, 7, 7 and 6, respectively. One patient with pelvis tumor and 2 with colon cancer were successfully diagnosed with abdominal US. Colon cancers were confirmed and pelvis tumor was diagnosed as ovarian squamous cell carcinoma with surgical specimens. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% (95% CI: 44-100%) and 97.1% (95% CI: 85-99%), respectively.Conclusions:Our data clearly recommended that abdominal US be performed carefully for patients with abdominal symptoms and leukocytosis or elevated CRP since potentially they had malignancies.
