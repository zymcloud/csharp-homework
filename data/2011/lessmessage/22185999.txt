Pure erythroid leukemia (PEL) is an extremely rare disorder characterized by neoplastic proliferation of immature erythroblasts. A 66-year-old man, who had received chemoradiotherapy for hypopharyngeal cancer, was admitted because of pancytopenia. Bone marrow was infiltrated with 81% proerythroblasts positive for CD71 and CD235a. An increased number of macrophages with active hemophagocytosis was also present. Chromosome analysis showed hypodiploid complex abnormalities. The patient died of progressive disease despite induction chemotherapy. Erythroblastic infiltration into the liver and hemophagocytosis in the spleen were found at autopsy. Therapy-related PEL with hemophagocytic syndrome and hepatic infiltration of PEL has never been reported.
