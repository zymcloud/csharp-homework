Backgrounds:The Yondelis (trabectedin) project was initiated in January 2011 with the aim to obtain basic epidemiological information on patients with soft tissue sarcomas, standard treatment procedures, and results of trabectedin therapy in routine clinical practice. Expert patronage is provided by the Czech Society for Oncology, CzMA JEP. The project covers a representative sample of Comprehensive Cancer Care centres established to provide systematic treatment to patients with soft tissue sarcoma.Patients and methods:45 patients diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma were retrospectively included in the database. Median age at the initiation of trabectedin therapy was 51 years (23-72 years). Leiomyosarcoma was the most frequent tumour (35.6%), synovial sarcoma occurred in 13.3% of patients; liposarcoma, peripheral nerve sheath tumours and unspecified sarcomas contributed 6.7% each. 62.2% of sarcomas were larger than 5 cm. Trabectedin was administered in a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 once in 3 weeks. 40% of patients received trabectedin as the 2nd line treatment, 35.6% as the 3rd line, and 34.4% as the 4th line.Results:Median number of administered cycles was 4 (1-10 cycles). Neutropenia (28.9% of patients) and elevated liver enzymes (26.7% of patients) were the most frequent adverse affects. 73.8% of patients terminated the therapy due to disease progression. Treatment response was recorded in 6.6% of patients (complete and partial remission), stable disease in 26.7%, and progression in 53.3%. Median overall survival (95% CI) was 11.7 months (9.6; 13.8), median progression-free survival (95% CI) was 3 months (2.4; 3.6).Conclusion:Expert cancer societies have recently recommended trabectedin as the 2nd line palliative treatment for soft tissue sarcomas with documented effectiveness, particularly in liposarcomas and leiomyosarcomas, and good safety profile.
