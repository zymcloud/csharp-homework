Background/aims:Hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is risky for cirrhotic patients with severe thrombocytopenia.Methodology:Among 23 patients with histologically proven cirrhosis who underwent hepatic resection for HCC at our hospital since 2006, 7 had severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count Results:All 7 patients had hepatitis C virus-related liver cirrhosis. The median preoperative platelet count was 4.3×104/mm3 (range, 3.9-4.9×104/mm3) and the median operative time and intraoperative bleeding were 77min and 193cc, respectively. Postoperative complications were observed in 4 patients (57%) and all were managed conservatively. Four patients received an intraoperative platelet-rich transfusion, but this had no beneficial effect on intraoperative bleeding or postoperative changes in platelet counts. The cirrhotic patients with severe thrombocytopenia were significantly younger and had a significantly shorter operative time compared to those without severe thrombocytopenia. There were no other differences between the groups.Conclusions:Our results suggest that the indication for hepatectomy in cirrhotic patients should not be based on platelet counts alone. However, we note that the younger age and shorter operative time for the patients with severe thrombocytopenia might have contributed to the safety of hepatectomy.
