Objective:To evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-guided microwave ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma inconspicuous on conventional US.Materials and methods:From March 2006 to February 2010, 107 patients (93 male, 14 female; mean age 58.9±11.0 years) with 107 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nodules (mean maximum diameter 19.5±8.5 mm) inconspicuous on conventional US underwent microwave (MW) ablation under CEUS guidance in this study. US contrast agent was SonoVue (Bracco, Milan, Italy), a second-generation contrast agent. CEUS was performed first, and then MW ablation was carried out by means of CEUS guidance under unconscious intravenous anaesthesia if the tumours were displayed on CEUS.Results:105 tumours were successfully visualised on CEUS by using 1-2 times contrast agent injection and MW ablation was performed under CEUS guidance. The technical success rate was 98.13% (105/107). The number of antenna insertions for each tumour was 1.89±0.92, and the mean session of MW ablation for each tumour was 1.08±0.28. The mean duration of energy application for each tumour was 7.05±4.03 min. The follow-up time was 12-54 months (median 18 months). The technique effectiveness rate was 99.05% (104/105). The local tumour progression rate was 1.9% (2/105). There were no severe complications in any patients.Conclusion:CEUS-guided MW ablation is an efficient and feasible treatment method for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma inconspicuous on conventional US.
