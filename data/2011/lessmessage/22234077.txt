Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become an important health concern. However, data on its economic burden are limited. This study was undertaken to estimate the hospital costs and length of hospital stay (LOHS) for hepatectomy in patients with HCC, and identify the contributing factors to them.Methodology:A prospective case series observation was performed from January 2009 to December 2009 at two general hospitals in China. The information, such as demographic and clinical data, of HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy was recorded. Hospital costs and LOHS were analyzed to estimate the distribution of healthcare utilization. The multiple linear regression analysis was utilized to determine the impact of different demographic and clinical factors on costs and LOHS.Results:A total of 220 patients were enrolled. The median hospital costs were $3453.7. The median LOHS was 13 days. The major fraction of the total costs was medication costs, accounting for 40.2%. LOHS was the key determinant of hospital costs. Blood transfusion, postoperative complication and Child-Pugh score were also independent but less contributory determinants. Additionally, predictors for prolonged LOHS included postoperative complication and surgical procedure.Conclusions:Hospital costs and LOHS for hepatectomy have their particular contributing factors. The results may be useful in resource allocation and cost-effectiveness analysis of intervention for HCC treatment.
