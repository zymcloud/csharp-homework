Purpose. The incidence of liver tumors is rising in USA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate liver oxido-reductive status in the presence of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods. Glutathione species and ophthalmate (OA) concentrations were measured by LC-MS in processed plasma and red blood cells (RBC) from infected Woodchuck with hepatitis virus (WHV). Blood samples were obtained from: (i) infected animals with tumors (WHV+/HCC+), (ii) infected animals without tumors (WHV+/HCC-) and (iii) healthy animals (WHC-/HCC-). Results. The concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) and the ratio GSH/GSG were lower in plasma from WHV+/HCC+ animals when compared to WHV+/HCC- and WHV-/HCC- (P
