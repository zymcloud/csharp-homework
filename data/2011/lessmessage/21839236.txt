Introduction:Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for various types of end-stage liver disease and the most appropriate alternative for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated liver cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to describe our initial experience with the use of 18-FDG positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography CT before and after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC patients undergoing liver transplantation, seeking to predict the percentage of tumor necrosis achieved by TACE procedures.Patients and methods:From January 2007 through December 2009, 39 patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis were included in our liver transplantation program. We selected the 6 subjects who underwent 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (18-FDG PET/CT) pre- and post-TACE.Results:The median SUV (standardized uptake value) in the lesions studied were 4 (range, 2.79-6.95) before TACE with a median post-TACE SUV of 0 (range, 0-4). Among patients whose post-TACE SUV decreased to 80%.Conclusion:Performance of an 18-FDG PET/CT before and after TACE and comparison of SUV in patients with HCC awaiting liver transplantation provided valuable information regarding the effectiveness of TACE.
