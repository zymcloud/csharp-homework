Background:Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using Fibroscan is an increasingly popular non-invasive method for quantifying liver fibrosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis. We aimed to explore potential impact of Fibroscan on clinical management.Material and methods:133 patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBV, n = 75) or C (HCV, n = 58) underwent Fibroscan measurement. LSM results were compared with liver biopsy results, ultrasound, and APRI-scores, and the impact of LSM on clinical management was evaluated.Results:LSM results indicated fibrosis stage F0-F1 in 84 patients (63%), F2 in 28 (21%), F3 in 8 (6%), and F4 in 13 patients (10%). Nineteen patients had liver biopsies within one year of LSM. In ten patients, LSM and biopsy showed the same fibrosis stage, in 8 there was one stage difference, and in 1 three stages difference. Ultrasound only showed cirrhosis in three patients, who all exhibited advanced cirrhosis at LSM. There was a statistically significant, but weak correlation between LSM results and APRI scores (r = 0.31, pvalue Conclusion:LSM appears to be a valuable non-invasive tool to manage patients with chronic viral hepatitis in clinical practice.
