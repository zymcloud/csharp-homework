Purpose:Sorafenib has been found to have significant clinical activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hand-foot skin syndrome (HFS) has been described with the usage of sorafenib. It is a dose-limiting toxicity and may lead to compromised efficacy because of dose reduction.Methods:From 14 patients diagnosed with HCC 10 who developed HFS while on treatment with sorafenib were included in this study. Sorafenib was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice daily vitamin E usage can be effective in HFS due to sorafenib, therefore vitamin E 300 mg/day was started when HFS occurred. HFS was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria.Results:Grade 2-3 HFS was found in 10 of 14 patients. Vitamin E was started to all patients without using topical agents. Mean time to the appearance of HFS was 15 Â± 3 days (range 10-22) after starting sorafenib. Grade was 3 in 4 patients, 2 in 4 patients and 1 in 2 patients. Vitamin E administration had a marked effect after 10-12 days of its initiation. Skin lesions disappeared without any dose modification.Conclusion:Sorafenib is the gold standard for HCC treatment. Dose modification due to HFS decreases the effectiveness of this agent. Adding vitamin E to sorafenib is effective in HFS without dose reduction or treatment interruption. This is the first clinical study to report resolution of HFS with vitamin E due to sorafenib therapy.
