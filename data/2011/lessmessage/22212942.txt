Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has become an important treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The good candidates for RFA are patients with HCC at an early stage (solitary tumor ≤ 5 cm in diameter or ≤ 3 nodules ≤ 3 cm in diameter). Several clinical trials have shown that RFA is effective in resection for the treatment of small HCC. Until now, RFA has been widely used as a radical treatment for small HCC. RFA also plays an important role in the multidisciplinary treatment of HCC and is usually combined with other therapies such as resection, vascular intervention, intratumor ethanol injection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and biological immune therapy. In this study, we will introduce our experience of RFA in the treatment of HCC in a cancer center in China.
