Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in codon 72 of the TP53 gene (rs1042522) and in the promoter region of the MDM2 gene (SNP309; rs2279744) have been shown to play a role in the predisposition to many cancers. However, these findings were inconsistent in other tumor types, and ethnicity is suspected to be a critical factor influencing the effects of these SNPs on the cancer risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether these functional SNPs were associated with an enhanced risk of liver tumorigenesis in Moroccan patients. We have genotyped both polymorphisms in 96 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 222 controls without HCC matched for age, gender and ethnicity by PCR-RFLP confirmed by sequencing. A joint effect between the MDM2 and TP53 polymorphisms and an increased risk of liver cancer was detected, with the odds ratio for the presence of both MDM2 309GG and TP53 72Pro/Pro genotypes being 10 (95% confidence interval 0.39-255.55). Interestingly, a significant increase in the HCC risk was observed when at least two deleterious alleles were present, indicating an allele dosage effect. There was no evidence for any association with early age of HCC onset when deleterious alleles of MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 Arg72Pro where present. Our findings suggest that the combination of TP53 72Pro and MDM2 309G polymorphisms enhance the risk of developing HCC. These results deserve further confirmation in other populations.
