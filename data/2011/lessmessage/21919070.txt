Î±-Feto protein (AFP) is the widely used tumor marker in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic and prognostic validity of a novel marker, serum Glypican-3 (GPC3) and to compare AFP in patients with HCC. One hundred and twenty-eight patients (75 patients with HCC, 55 patients with cirrhosis, and 28 healthy controls) were included in this study. Cut-off value of GPC3 was 3.9 pg/ml. AFP was divided into four subgroups, according to cut-off values with 13, 20, 100, and 200 ng/ml. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of GPC3 and AFP13, AFP20, AFP100, AFP200 subgroups and also GPC3+AFP13, GPC3+AFP20 , GPC3+AFP100 , GPC3+AFP200 combinations were compared. Serum GPC3 levels were significantly higher in patients with HCC and cirrhosis compared with control subjects (P
