Laparoscopic colorectal resection has been applied to advanced colorectal cancer. Synchronous liver metastasis of colorectal cancer would be treated safely and effectively by simultaneous laparoscopic colorectal and hepatic resection. Seven patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastasis treated by simultaneous laparoscopic resection were analyzed retrospectively. Three patients received a hybrid operation using a small skin incision, 2 patients underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery using a small incision produced for colonic anastomosis, and 2 patients were treated with pure laparoscopic resection. The mean total operation duration was 407 minutes, and mean blood loss was 207 mL. Negative surgical margins were achieved in all cases. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 16.4 days. No recurrence at the surgical margin was observed in the liver. For selected patients with synchronous liver metastasis of colorectal cancer, simultaneous laparoscopic resection is useful for minimizing operative invasiveness while maintaining safety and curability, with satisfying short- and long-term results.
