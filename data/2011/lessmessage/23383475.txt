A total of 3238 new cases of childhood cancer were registered during the period under study (1996-2007). These cases showed predominately the Northamerican/European pattern of neoplasias: leukemias were the most frequent (46.1%), followed by tumors of the central nervous system (CNST, 12.0%), and lymphomas (10.8%); the overall incidence was 125.6 (all rates per 1000 000 children/year), with incidences of 136.3, 164.1, 95.2, 114.7, for < 1, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14 age group, respectively. Compared to children in the United States, Mexican children had a greater incidence of leukemias, retinoblastomas, and germ cell tumors; a lower incidence of CNST, neuroblastomas, kidney tumors, soft-tissue sarcomas, and carcinomas; and similar incidences of lymphomas, liver tumors, and bone tumors. The male/female ratio was 1.1 and the highest incidence was found for those less than five years of age. Overall, the incidence showed a trends to decrease (average annual percent change (AAPC), -3.3; CI 95%, -6.3, -0.1), with the greatest decrease during the period 1996-2000 (AAPC, -7.9; CI 95%, -15.5, 0.3) and remaining stable thereafter (2000-2007) (AAPC, -0.5; CI 95%, -4.0, 3.2). Stages III and IV were found in 57.4 % of the cases of solid tumors.
