Background/aims:The efficacy of preoperative transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. This study aims to systematically identify and summarize the effect of preoperative TACE for patients with resectable HCC.Methodology:Databases, reference lists and conference proceedings were searched extensively to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. Data were synthesized using the random effects model. Results were expressed as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results:A total of 3 randomized controlled trials involving 257 participants were included. Meta-analysis showed that 5-year overall survival (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.23-2.34; p=0.60) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.66-1.77; p=0.77) had no significant differences.Conclusions:The present data suggests that there are no significant benefits for 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with resectable HCC using preoperative TACE treatment. Further well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm or adjust current conclusions.
