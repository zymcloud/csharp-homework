Background:There are no convincing data supporting the routine use of pre-emptive therapy against HBV reactivation in various loco-regional therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study investigated the incidence, severity and risk factors of HBV reactivation during loco-regional therapies.Methods:A total of 205 prospectively enrolled patients were classified in order of increasing intensity of loco-regional therapies: local ablation therapy (LAT; 43 patients), transarterial chemotherapy using adriamycin (TAC-ADR; 93 patients) or combined epirubicin-cisplatin (TAC-EC; 26 patients), and combined chemo-radiotherapy (TAC-EC+RT; 43 patients).Results:During the follow-up, 62 (30.2%) patients developed HBV reactivation. Multivariate analysis identified HBV DNA levels >10‚Å¥ copies/ml (P=0.041) and treatment option (P=0.001) to be independent predictors of HBV reactivation. There was a significant trend for increasing risk of reactivation with increasing intensity of therapy, with hazard ratios of 1.0 for LAT, 2.45 for TAC-ADR, 4.19 for TAC-EC and 10.17 for TAC-EC+RT. The severity of reactivated disease was also increased with increasing treatment intensity (P-value for trend Conclusions:High-level viraemia and high-level treatment intensity are the major risk factors for HBV reactivation during loco-regional therapy. Trends are evident for the increased risk and severity of reactivation with the aggressiveness of treatment. Pre-emptive antiviral therapy should be recommended for all patients with high-level viraemia irrespective of treatment option, or those undergoing any intensive therapy.
