The study was aimed at evaluating apoptosis induction potentials of methanolic and aqueous extracts of Rheum emodi Wall. ex Meissn. rhizome. The ability of the extracts to induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-435S (human breast carcinoma), Hep3B (human hepatocellular carcinoma) and PC-3 (human prostate cancer) cell lines were tested by ELISA to detect cellular DNA fragmentation. Results obtained from the present study confirm that the extracts target the cancerous cells towards apoptosis. The study concludes that R. emodi possess anticancer metabolites that can be isolated and used as precursors in development of anticancer drugs. Suppression of apoptosis might contribute to tumor development by means of accumulation of continuously proliferating cells. The strategy employed in this study, to induce apoptosis in the tumor cells, could be a potential target of therapeutic intervention of cancers.
