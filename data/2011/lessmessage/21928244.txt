A lack of sensitive and specific tumor markers for early diagnosis and treatment is a major cause for the high mortality rate of ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to identify potential proteomics-based biomarkers useful for the differential diagnosis between ovarian cancer and benign pelvic masses. Serum samples from 41 patients with ovarian cancer, 32 patients with benign pelvic masses, and 41 healthy female blood donors were examined, and proteomic profiling of the samples was assessed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy (MS). A confirmatory study was also conducted with serum specimens from 58 patients with ovarian carcinoma, 37 patients with benign pelvic masses, and 48 healthy women. A classification tree was established using Biomarker Pattern Software. Six differentially expressed proteins (APP, CA 125, CCL18, CXCL1, IL-8, and ITIH4) were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS/MS and database searches. Two of the proteins overexpressed in ovarian cancer patients, chemokine CC2 motif ligand 18 (CCL18) and chemokine CXC motif ligand 1 (CXCL1), were automatically selected in a multivariate predictive model. These two protein biomarkers were then validated and evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 535 serum specimens (130 ovarian cancer, 64 benign ovarian masses, 36 lung cancer, 60 gastric cancer, 55 nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 48 hepatocellular carcinoma, and 142 healthy women). The combined use of CCL18 and CXCL1 as biomarkers for ovarian cancer had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 97%. The multivariate ELISA analysis of the two putative markers in combination with CA 125 resulted in a sensitivity of 99% for healthy women and 94% for benign pelvic masses, and a specificity of 92% for both groups; these values were significantly higher than those obtained with CA 125 alone (p and lt;0.05). We conclude that serum CCL18 and CXCL1 are potentially useful as novel circulating tumor markers for the differential diagnosis between ovarian cancer and benign ovarian masses.
