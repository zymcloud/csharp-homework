Carcinoma metastasis to the thyroid is uncommon, but may be increasing. We describe here a patient with a metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presenting within a medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The thyroid tumor was detected synchronously with the hepatic lesion by FDG-PET imaging, and HCC metastasis within MTC was confirmed by histological analysis of the thyroid gland.
