Background:Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant tumor arising from any gestation. Several cases of metastatic choriocarcinoma have been reported in the literature during viable intrauterine pregnancies.Case:We present a case of choriocarcinoma metastatic to the lungs, liver and brain in a 28-year-old female who received systemic chemotherapy, consisting of etoposide-methotrexate-actinomycin D-cyclophosphamide-vincristine (EMA-CO), during pregnancy and subsequently delivered a viable female infant at 32 weeks' gestation. This case is one of only a few presented in the literature in which metastatic choriocarcinoma was treated during pregnancy with delivery during the third trimester.Conclusion:Most reported cases of metastatic choriocarcinoma involve immediate delivery, usually via cesarean section, of premature infants in an effort to initiate chemotherapy after delivery, avoiding inherent risks to the fetus. Our patient was successfully treated with EMA-CO regimen for high-risk gestational trophoblastic tumors and delivered a developmentally normal infant. This report details this case and the importance of early initiation of cytotoxic drugs.
