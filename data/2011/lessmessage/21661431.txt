Background/aims:To investigate the effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) on expression of nm23-H1 and TIMP-2 in the tumor tissue and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:Seventy-two patients with resectable HCC were randomized into two equal groups with 36 patients in each: TACE before surgical resection of HCC (Group A) and direct surgical resection of HCC (Group B). All samples were subjected to pathological examination and immunohistochemical staining using nm23-H1 and TIMP-2 antibodies. Expression level and distribution of nm23-H1 and TIMP-2 in tumor and adjacent tissue were assessed. Extrahepatic metastasis and survival time of patients in both groups were evaluated through 36 months follow-up.Results:Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumor tissues from patients in Group A had a higher positive expression of nm23-H1 than Group B (chi2=15.52, pConclusions:Preoperative TACE enhances the expression of metastasis suppressors nm23-H1 and TIMP-2, and may potentially inhibit metastasis of HCC and increase the survival time of patients with the resectable HCC.
