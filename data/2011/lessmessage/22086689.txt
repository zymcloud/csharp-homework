In case 1, endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor with central ulceration in the esophagus of a 54- year-old man. A biopsy specimen revealed small cell carcinoma without metastasis and the stage of the cancer was stage I (T2N0M0). Two cycles of concurrent cisplatin, etoposide and radiotherapy resulted in an incomplete response/stable disease. The tumor recurred and had metastasized to the brain, lung, liver, lymph nodes of the mediastinum, abdomen and bones after six cycles. Two cycles of irinotecan and cisplatin then elicited a complete response in the primary esophageal lesion. However, progressive disease was identified in the metastatic bone tumors. Despite two further cycles of therapy, he died 447 days after the initial course. In case 2, a biopsy specimen of a tumor with central ulceration in the esophagus of a 77-year old man with swallowing difficulty indicated small cell carcinoma. The stage of the cancer was diagnosed as stage II (T3N0M0). Two cycles of irinotecan, cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy elicited a complete response. However, the tumor metastasized to the brain and the liver 644 days after starting treatment. Two cycles of carboplastin plus irinotecan elicited a partial response in the metastatic tumors, but he died 988 days after starting chemotherapy.
