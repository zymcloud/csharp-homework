In vitro, we studied the effect of melatonin (1mkM) on the sensitivity of murine transformed fibroblasts 3T3-SV40 and murine hepatoma cells MN22a to the lysis by natural killer cells. In vivo, we examined changes in tumorigenic properties of MN22a cells treated with melatonin. It was shown that the sensitivities of both cell types to lysis by killer cells fell sharply fourfold after 24-hour treatment with melatonin; their cytotoxic index value approximated to that of intact cells, insensitive to natural killer cells. After MN22a cells were pre-treated with melatonin for 24 h before injection into syngenic mice, tumorigenesis and development slowed down and mortality rates decreased. Both effects were reversible. All cellular parameters were similar to control ones 24 hrs after evacuation of melatonin. Thus melatonin failed to change cell cycle progression which pointed to an unaltered rate of cell proliferation. Different hypotheses are discussed on the mechanisms of melatonin action which result in transient reversion of transformed phenotype.
