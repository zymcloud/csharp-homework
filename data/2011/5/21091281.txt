Background:Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was originally described as a cytokine that inhibits migration of macrophages at the site of inflammation. Subsequently it was also identified as a stress-induced hormone released from the anterior pituitary lobe in response to some pro-inflammatory stimuli like endotoxins and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α).Aim:To compare postoperative changes in serum MIF levels of patients undergoing bowel and liver resections. It has clinical relevance to describe the kinetics of this crucial mediator of systemic inflammation in surgery.Methods:A total of 58 patients were studied over 4 years. Group A (28 patients) underwent only hepatic resection without enterotomy. Group B (30 patients) had bowel resection with enterotomy. MIF, IL-1β, IL-8, prealbumin, albumin, α1-glycoprotein, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein levels were measured preoperatively, immediately following surgery, and postoperatively for three consecutive days. To evaluate organ functions, multiple organ dysfunction score was used.Results:A significantly higher level of MIF (4,505 pg/mL) was found in group A when compared to that of group B immediately following surgery. Other parameters monitored in this study were not statistically different between the two groups.Conclusion:Higher elevations in MIF levels with liver resections, compared to bowel resections, might be attributable to MIF release from damaged liver cells. The presumably minimal endotoxin exposure during bowel surgery was either insufficient or inefficient to induce relevant MIF elevations in our patients. To fully delineate implications of this finding further studies are needed.
