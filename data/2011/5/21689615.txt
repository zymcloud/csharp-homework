Understanding of the genetic changes and molecular signaling pathways that are active in hepatocellular carcinoma has improved substantially over the last decade. As more information becomes available, it is clear that the prognostication of hepatocellular carcinoma will soon include molecular and genomic "fingerprints" that are unique to each cancer, which will allow more personalized treatment plans for patients as more targeted therapies become available. This article discusses the molecular and genomic changes that are important in hepatocellular carcinoma in order for clinicians to understand the current and forthcoming treatment options for patients with liver cancer.
