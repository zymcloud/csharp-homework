In this symposium, we explained etiology, prevention and treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been revealed that the carcinogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma is almost caused by the infection of hepatitis virus B and/or C. Therefore, the carcinogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma is able to be prevented. Even if the carcinogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma occurs, the diagnosis and treatment in the worldwide level; radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), hepatectomy, and liver transplantation will be offered to patients with HCC in Japan. We hope that this symposium would help the attendance to understand the prevention and treatment for HCC.
