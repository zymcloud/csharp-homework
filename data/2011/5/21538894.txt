Numerous antioxidants have been reported to cause transcriptional activation of several antioxidant enzymes through binding antioxidant-response element on their promoter region. We, therefore, attempted to examine whether glyceollins, which share common structural features with many phase 2 enzyme inducers and antioxidant activity, could induce detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes. Glyceollins induced NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase activity in a dose-dependent manner in both mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 and its mutant BPRc1 cells. The compounds also increased the expression of some representative antioxidant enzymes, such as heme oxygenase 1,gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase, and glutathione reductase, by promoting nuclear translocation of the NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, phosphorylation of Akt and antioxidant response element-mediated reporter gene expression were enhanced by glyceollins but suppressed by LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). This suggests that glyceollins may cause Nrf2-mediated phase 2 enzyme induction through activation of the PI3K signaling pathway as well as interaction with Keap1. Our molecular docking simulations also suggest that the glyceollin isomers tightly bind into the binding pocket around Cys151, preventing Nrf2 from docking to Keap1. In conclusion, the current data suggest that glyceollins induced phase 2 detoxifying enzymes likely through promoting nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which is known to be regulated by phosphorylation of Nrf2 and/or disrupting Keap1-Nrf2 complex formation.
