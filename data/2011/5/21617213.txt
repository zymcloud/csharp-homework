Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common malignant tumour, with a high mortality rate. This study aimed to investigate the effect of hyperthermia on HepG2 and LX-1 cell lines to gain more information on thermal treatment of liver tumours.Materials and methods:The cell lines HepG2, LX-1 and their co-cultures were heated from 55°C to 85°C for different time spans. After heat exposure, metabolic activity was measured immediately, and after 24 h and 48 h using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) test to assess how many cells had survived heating.Results:Our results show highly significant differences between the temperature tolerance of HepG2 and LX-1 cells. Alone, HepG2 cells are most sensitive to heat-induced cell death, their sensitivity decreased with rising percentages of LX-1 cells in the co-culture.Conclusion:Our results suggest that the outcome of thermal cancer therapy is dependent on the temperature and the grade of fibrosis in the treated livers.
