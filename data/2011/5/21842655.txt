Objective:To investigate the influences of extracts of Oxytropis falcata on proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells and expression of MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2).Method:SMMC-7721 cells were treated for 24 h with five fractions obtained from 0. falcata in different concentrations. Inhibition on proliferation of the SMMC-7721 cells was assessed by MT method. Secretion of MMP-2 was measured by ELISA in the supernatant of SMMC-7721 cells treated with fractions of essential oil and total flavonoids for 24 h. Transcription of mRNA of MMP-2 was detected by Real-time PCR.Result:In MT assay, essential oil and total flavonoids showed potential antiproliferative activity on SMMC-7721 in a concentration dependent manner. Data of ELISA showed that fraction of essential oil suppressed secretion of MMP-2 significantly. Results of Real-time PCR indicated that both essential oil and total flavonoids restrained expression of mRNA of MMP-2.Conclusion:It suggested that essential oil and total flavonoids of O. falcata inhibit proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells through down-regulating secretion and expression of MMP-2 in cells. However, further experiments are necessary to carry out to investigate the potential mechanism.
