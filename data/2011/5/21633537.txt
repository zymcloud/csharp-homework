Aim:To evaluate the association of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1 alleles with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through meta-analysis of published data.Methods:Case-control studies on HLA-DQB1 allele association with HCC published up to January 2010 were included in the analyses. The odds ratios (ORs) of HLA-DQB1 allele distributions in HCC patients were analyzed and compared with healthy controls. The meta-analysis software REVMAN 5.0 was applied for investigating heterogeneity among individual studies and for summarizing all the studies. A meta-analysis was performed using fixed-effect or random-effect methods, depending on the absence or presence of significant heterogeneity. Seven case-control studies containing 398 cases and 594 controls were included in the final analysis.Results:Among the five family alleles, two (DQB1*02 and DQB1*03) were found to be significantly associated with the risk of HCC. The combined OR for the association of DQB1*02 and DQB1*03 allele with the risk for HCC was 1.78 (95% CI: 1.05-3.03, P = 0.03) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.48-0.89, P = 0.007), respectively. Among the 13 specific alleles, two (DQB1*0502 and DQB1*0602) were significantly associated with risk of HCC. The combined OR for the association of DQB1*0502 and DQB1*0602 allele with the risk for HCC was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.14-2.92, P = 0.01) and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.36-0.95, P = 0.03), respectively. No significant association was established for other HLA-DQB1 family alleles and specific alleles.Conclusion:Our results support the hypothesis that specific HLA-DQB1 allele families and alleles might influence the susceptibility or resistance to HCC, although it needs further investigations.
