Chronic HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection is an important cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. HCV-related cirrhosis is the main indication for liver transplantation in our geographical area. Thus, treatment of this disease represents an important economical burden for the Health Care System. Current treatment of hepatitis C consists of pegylated interferon and ribavirin: only half of the patients achieve a sustained virological response after treatment. Factors related to the virus and the host influence response to treatment. Polymorphisms near the gene IL28B (encoding interferon-Î»-3) have been recently identified as strong predictors of spontaneous HCV clearance in acute infection and of response to antiviral treatment in chronic hepatitis C. The aim of this article is to review the genetic studies that have emerged during the last months and its clinical implications, as well as to emphasize how Genetics is gaining importance in the management of liver diseases.
