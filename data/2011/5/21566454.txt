Background:Clear cell carcinoma of the ovary is known to be resistant to chemotherapy.Case:A 59-year-old woman was diagnosed with advanced clear cell carcinoma of the ovary after an exploratory laparotomy. Large disseminated foci expanded from diaphragm to omentum to liver. Three courses of chemotherapy combined with irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) and cisplatin (CDDP)(CPT-P) remarkably reduced the volume of the primary tumor and disseminated foci. These diseases could be extirpated completely by the subsequent interval debulking surgery.Conclusion:CPT-P may become a promising regimen for clear cell carcinoma of the ovary.
