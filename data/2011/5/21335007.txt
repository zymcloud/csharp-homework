Background & aims:Iron may influence severity and progression of non-hemochromatotic liver diseases. Our aim was to assess the relationship of iron and HFE genetic variations to progression and outcomes in the HALT-C Trial and whether PegIFN therapy influenced iron variables.Methods:Participants were randomized to receive long-term PegIFN [n = 400] or no therapy [n = 413] for 3.5 y, with follow-up for up to 8.7 y [median 6.0 y]. Associations of patient characteristics with iron variables at baseline and over time were carried out using Kaplan-Meier analyses, Cox regression models, and repeated measures analysis of covariance.Results:Participants who developed clinical outcomes [CTP > 7, ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, SBP, HCC, death] had significantly higher baseline scores for stainable iron in hepatocytes and in portal tract cells than those without. There were significant direct correlations between stainable iron in portal triads and lobular and total Ishak inflammatory and fibrosis scores [P Conclusions:Stainable iron in hepatocytes and portal tract cells is a predictor of progression and clinical and histological outcomes in advanced chronic hepatitis C. Chronic low-dose PegIFN therapy did not improve outcomes, nor iron variables.
