Objective:The purpose of our study was to evaluate a new technique for registration of postprocedure to preprocedure CT images to determine the effect on the safety margin assessment after radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Materials and methods:Registration of post-RFA CT to pre-RFA CT images was performed using prototype software via nonrigid registration in 31 patients with hepato-cellular carcinoma who were treated with RFA. Registration accuracy was validated by setting pairs of corresponding landmarks on registered post-RFA CT and pre-RFA CT images and by calculating the mean difference between the corresponding landmarks. Three radiologists independently conducted a retrospective review of the pre-RFA and post-RFA CT images for safety margin assessment with and without registered images. The safety margin was rated using a 4-point scale (1, residual tumor; 2, Results:The mean difference between the corresponding landmarks was 1.3 mm, thus suggesting accurate registration. A more accurate correlation between the degree of the reader safety margin and the reference value was obtained from pre-RFA and post-RFA CT images using registered CT images than without using registered images (Î³, 0.918 vs 0.887 for reader 1, 0.888 vs 0.651 for reader 2, and 0.811 vs 0.497 for reader 3, respectively). Interobserver agreement (kappa) increased from 0.503-0.558 in the first session without registered images to 0.807-0.869 in the second session with registered CT images.Conclusion:Registration of post-RFA CT to pre-RFA CT images is an accurate and useful technique for assessing the safety margin immediately after RFA.
