Background:The outcome of germ-cell tumors (GCTs) is a hallmark of good-quality cancer care. In the Eurocare-4 study, the mean 5-year survival for patients diagnosed from 1995 to 1999 was 95.5%.Patients and methods:We carried out a population-based retrospective chart review study of male patients diagnosed with GCT in 1999 and 2000 in southern Portugal (2 119 065 males).Results:There were 87 GCTs-79 testicular, 2 retroperitoneal, 3 mediastinal, 2 of the central nervous system and 1 of the stomach. For the 81 patients with testicular or retroperitoneal primaries, 35 had stage I, 13 stage II and 30 stage III at presentation (3 unknown). Classification by International Germ Cell Consensus Classification Group criteria, 17 belonged to the poor prognosis group (mediastinal primary 3, liver metastases 11 and very elevated markers 3). With median follow-up of 89 months, the 5-year absolute overall survival was 80% (100% for stage I, 92% for stage II and 53% for stage III disease).Conclusions:While GCT incidence was similar to neighboring Spain, the 5-year overall survival was lower than that of other European countries. This may result from delays in diagnosis, suggested by high proportion of high-stage and large-burden disease, and poor adherence to recommended treatment algorithms.
