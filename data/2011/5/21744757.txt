The purpose of this case report is to increase the knowledge about bone metastatic pattern in gastric cancer. A 59-year-old man presented with headache three years after a total gastrectomy for signet-ring cell carcinoma. Head computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple osteolytic lesions of the cranial vault and base, consistent with metastatic or haematological disease. Bone scintigraphy confirmed areas of accumulation only in the skull. An extensive search didn't show any other tumor. Bone biopsy revealed metastatic signet-ring cell carcinoma. In gastric cancer, bone metastases are generally associated with metastases in lymph nodes, liver, and lung, and have a higher frequency in the thoracolumbar spine. However, cranial bone metastases presenting with headache may be the only manifestation of gastric cancer recurrence.
