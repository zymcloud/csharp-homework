Objective:To compare the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) alone or plus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of single branch portal vein tumor thrombus(PVTT)in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) so as to evaluate the safety, control rate, prognostic factors and overall survival.Methods:From January 2004 to December 2007, 50 HCC patients (Results:Of all 50 HCC patients with single branch PVTT with TACE or RFA, 47 patients (TACE, n = 24; TACE-RFA, n = 23) received all the scheduled procedures and completed the follow-up. Two patients (8.3%) in TACE group had liver dysfunction versus none in TACE-RFA group, 2 patients (8.7%) developed bile duct injury in TACE-RFA group related with the RFA procedure. The OR (overall response) for PVTT was 54.2% (complete response (CR) 8.3%, partial response (PR) 45.8%) in TACE group while 87.0% (CR 60.9%, PR 26.1%) in TACE-RFA group during the follow-up. From the definite diagnosis of HCC, the median survival was 8 months. And the 1-, 2- & 3-year survival rates were 33.3%, 12.5%, 8.3% in TACE group. And 26 months, 65.2%, 47.8%, 30.4% in TACE-RFA group respectively. The difference between two groups was significant. From the definite diagnosis of PVTT, the respective data were 7 months, 12.5% and 4.2%, 0 in TACE group versus 22 months, 52.2%, 34.8%, and 8.7% in TACE-RFA group with a significant P value. In multivariate analysis, only therapy (TACE or TACE-RFA) showed a protective value (hazard rate 0.430 vs 0.345, P Conclusion:RFA is both safe and efficacious to prolong survival in the treatment of single branch PVTT plus TACE in selected HCC patients. It may provide rationales for further studies of evaluating the outcome of RFA plus other therapies in the treatment of HCC with single branch PVTT.
