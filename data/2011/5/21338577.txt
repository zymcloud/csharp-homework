Cancer/Testis (CT) antigens are considered promising target molecules for immunotherapy. To identify potential CT antigens, we performed immunoscreening of a testis cDNA library with sera from colon cancer patients by SEREX. We isolated 114 positive cDNA clones comprising 90 different antigens, designated BCP-1 through BCP-90. Quantitative real-time and conventional RT-PCR analysis showed that BCP-20, -33, and -41 antigens were expressed strongly only in a normal testis and detected in 22 cases (39%), 12 cases (21%), and 17 cases (30%), respectively, from 57 colon tumors. BCP-20 was also detected in various cancer cell lines including breast, colon, hepatoma, renal, thyroid anaplastic, ovary, sarcoma, and lung. By ELISA analysis, anti-BCP-20 antibody was detected in 3 of 50 colon cancer and 1 of 24 gastric cancer patients while healthy donors were three positive (3/50). But the BCP-20 antibody levels of patients with colon cancer showed significantly higher titers than those of healthy donors. These data suggest that the BCP-20 gene is a new CT antigen and may be useful for diagnosis and immunotherapy.
