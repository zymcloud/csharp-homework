A better understanding of signaling pathways in HCC pathogenesis has led to targeted therapies against HCC. Identification of liver cancer stem cell markers and their related pathways is one of the most important goals of liver cancer research. New therapies should ideally target cancer stem cells and not normal stem/progenitor cells, because the latter are very important in regeneration and repair. Individualized HCC therapy will require better definition of patient subgroups that benefit most or should be protected from therapy failure and unwanted side effects. Tumor tissue acquisition should be mandatory, reversing the practice that was established years ago when targeted HCC therapy was but a pipe dream.
