Seven lignans, previously isolated from Pycnanthus angolensis or obtained by derivatization, namely the dibenzylbutane-type lignans threo-4,4'-dihydroxy-3-methoxylignan (1), 4'-hydroxy-3,3',4-trimethoxylignan (2), (-)-dihydroguaiaretic acid (3), 3,3',4,4'-tetramethoxylignan (4), 4,4'-diacetyl-3,3'-dimethoxylignan (5), heliobuphthalmin (6) and the butyrolactone lignan hinokinin (7), were evaluted for their ability as apoptosis inducers in human hepatoma HuH-7 cells. Cell viability assays, morphological evaluation of apoptosis and enzymatic analyses of caspase activity in HuH-7 cells were carried out. Using the lactate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, it was demonstrated that the lignans (1-7) tested significantly reduced viability of HuH-7 cells. Morphologic evaluation of HuH-7 cells using Hoechst staining and fluorescence microscopy revealed that lignans 1-7 were strong inducers of apoptosis. In fact, HuH-7 cells developed morphological changes of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. However, lignans 2 and 7 were the most promising compounds in this study, inducing 2.4- and 2.5-fold increases in apoptotic cells as compared to controls. Caspase-3-like activity assays confirmed the morphologic data.
