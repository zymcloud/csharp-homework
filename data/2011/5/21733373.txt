Objective:To analyse the clinico-pathologic characteristics, diagnosis, therapy and prognostic of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix (SCNCC).Methods:The clinic-pathological features of 12 patients with SCNCC treated in Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, admitted during March 2006 to July 2010, were analyzed retrospectively.Results:Of 12 patients, the mean age was 38.7 years (rang 28 - 57 years), 6 had stages Ib1-IIa, 6 had stages IIb-IV. Among 8 patients (Ib1-IIIb) underwent surgery, 4 of them received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 8 of them received adjuvant chemotherapy and(or) radiotherapy. All had greater than one-half stromal invasion, 4 patients had positive pelvic lymph nodes metastases. The positive ratio of the chromogranin (CgA), synaptophysin, neuronspecific enolase (NSE), cytokeratins (CK), CD(56) tested by immunohistochemical staining were 8/12, 9/10, 4/4, 4/4, 4/4, respectively. Median follow-up period was 3 months (1 - 22 months). Among 8 patients underwent surgery, 2 patients developed lung metastases, 1 patient developed liver and lung metastases, 1 patient developed liver metastases concurrently with bone metastases, disease-free survival (DFS) were 3 months (Ib2 with positive lymph nodes), 4.6 months (IIa), 7 months (Ib1), 17 months (Ib2); 2 patient died (8.5 and 11.3 months, respectively) after surgery; 4 patients are alive and show no evidence of disease. Among 4 patients untreated, 1 patients received concurrent chemoradiation and are alive for 10.1 months. Two patient untreated (IIIb, IV) died after 0.6 and 1.3 months final diagnosis, respectively. One patient was lost follow-up.Conclusions:SCNCC is a highly malignant tumor with rare morbility, propensity for distant spread and dismal prognosis. Final diagnosis of SCNCC depends on pathomorphology and immunohistochemical analysis. Combined therapeutic modalities may in favor of survival in some patients.
