The sialic acid-specific cytotoxic lectin viscumin and its recombinant equivalent rViscumin specifically bind to CD75s-gangliosides with terminal Neu5Acα6Galβ4GlcNAc sequence. We, therefore, comparatively analyzed the content of CD75s-gangliosides and closely related iso-CD75s-gangliosides (terminated by Neu5Acα3Galβ4GlcNAc sequence) and the gene expression of associated β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1) and β-galactoside α-2,3-sialyltransferase 6 (ST3GAL6), respectively, in 35 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Ganglioside structures were identified in lipid extracts of matched pairs of malignant and nonmalignant liver tissues by thin-layer chromatography immunodetection coupled with infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry. CD75s- and iso-CD75s-gangliosides were found to be deregulated in tumor tissues and showed an elevated occurrence in 35 and 41% of HCCs, respectively, compared with nontumoral liver tissues. Statistical analysis revealed a correlation between enhanced iso-CD75s-ganglioside amount and a poor histopathological differentiation (τ = 0.317, P = 0.045) and a significant association of CD75s- and iso-CD75s-ganglioside levels in nontumorous (τ = 0.392, P = 0.003) and in tumorous tissues (τ = 0.650, P
