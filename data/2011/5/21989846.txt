Background:Recent research has suggested that the oncomir microRNA 155 (miR-155) is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the authors investigated the tumorigenic mechanism of this oncomir in the development of HCC.Methods:Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to analyze the expressions of miR-155 and its potential target genes in paired tumor tissues and adjacent tumor-free tissues and in disease-free liver tissue samples. The in silico predicted target genes of miR-155 were assessed by dual-luciferase reporting assay, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses. U6 promoters that drive miR-155 precursor overexpression and miR-155 tough decoy knock-down constructs were used to study its affects on cell proliferation in vitro and on tumor formation in nude mice.Results:Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a gradual ascension of miR-155 expression in cirrhotic liver tissues and in HCC tumor tissues compared with low expression levels in normal liver tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in HepG2 cells enhanced its tumorigenesis, whereas depletion of the endogenous miR-155 reversed these tumorigenic properties. Ectopic expression of sex-determining region Y box 6 (SOX6) was able to reverse the growth-promoting property of miR-155. Concordantly, the results demonstrated for the first time that SOX6 is a direct target of miR-155. Further analysis revealed that SOX6 reduced cell growth by up-regulating p21waf1/cip1 expression in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, a decline in p21waf1/cip1 expression caused by miR-155 could be reversed by SOX6 expression.Conclusions:The current data indicated that SOX6 is a novel target of miR-155 and that miR-155 enhances liver cell tumorigenesis at least in part through the novel miR-155/SOX6/p21waf1/cip1 axis. These findings suggest that miR-155 may be a potential target for HCC treatment.
