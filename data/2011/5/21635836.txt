Sorafenib is a new drug, multikinase inhibitor, which has been recently approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Up to 90 percent of patients receiving this drug have been reported to develop dermatological symptoms. Recently, it has been suggested that the appearance of skin toxicity during therapy may indicate antitumor activity. We report a new case of sorafenib-induced severe hand-foot skin reaction, which hindered the patient's normal life. The reaction was successfully treated with topical costicosteroids and discontinuation of sorafenib. However, the patient died one month later.
