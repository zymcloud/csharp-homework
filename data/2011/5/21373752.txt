We investigated whether altering caveolin-2 (cav-2) expression affects the proliferation of cancer cells. Cav-2 was not detected in HepG2, SH-SY5Y and LN-CaP cells, and the loss of cav-2 expression was not restored by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. In contrast, C6, HeLa, A549, MCF7 and PC3M cells expressed cav-2. Effects of re-expression of exogenous cav-2 in HepG2, SH-SY5Y and LN-CaP cells, and siRNA-mediated down-regulation of endogenous cav-2 in C6, HeLa, A549, MCF7 and PC3M cells on cancer proliferation were examined by MTT assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometric analysis. Cav-2 transfection in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and knockdown in C6 glioma cells caused reduction in cell proliferation and growth with retarded entry into the S phase. Cav-2 re-expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and depletion in HeLa epithelial cervical cancer and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells promoted cancer cell proliferation. Luciferase reporter assay showed that transcriptional activation of Elk-1 and STAT3 was significantly decreased in cav-2-transfected HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma and down-regulated C6 glioma cells. Our data suggest that cav-2 acts as a modulator of cancer progression.
