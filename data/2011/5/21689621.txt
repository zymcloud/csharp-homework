Locoregional therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma have progressed greatly in the last 30 years, beginning with the introduction of chemoembolization. Embolization techniques have evolved with the use of drug-eluting beads and radioembolization with yttrium-90. In the last 10 years, several new ablation techniques were developed including radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, cryoablation, laser ablation, and irreversible electroporation. Isolated or in combination, these techniques have already shown that they can improve patient survival and/or provide acceptable palliation.
