Aim:To study the expression of HIF-1alpha in serum of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) and effects on tumor invasion and metastasis.Methods:The serum HIF-1alpha level from 60 cases of PHC patients and 60 cases of normal healthy individuals were detected by ELISA.Results:The serum HIF-1alpha level of the PHC group was (161.14+/-80.79) pg/mL, the control group was (22.67+/-8.47) pg/mL, compared the different was significant (PConclusion:The serum HIF-1alpha has high expression in PHC. The serum HIF-1alpha expression has close relation with the whether distant metastasis of tumor, portal vein tumor thrombus and tumor capsule. The serum HIF-1alpha level can predict the invasion and metastasis of PHC.
