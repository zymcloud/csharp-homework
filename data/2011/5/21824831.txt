The prevalence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms in patients with a high risk of pancreatic adenocarcinoma was estimated to be 15%. However, a familial form of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms was never described.Methods:Three families (8 patients) with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms familial forms were described. Diagnosis was made according to radiological criteria and was confirmed by pathological data. Genetic predisposing factors of pancreatic cancer were searched for.Results:Symptoms related to intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms were recurrent acute pancreatitis (n=3) or fortuitous discovery (n=5). Number of cystic lesions was â‰¤3 (n=4) or >3 (n=4). Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms involved branch ducts (n=7) or both main pancreatic duct and branch duct (n=1). Severe and moderate dysplasia was found on surgical specimens. No genetic alteration was found (BRCA2, p16 or CDKN2A genes).Conclusion:A familial form of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms was found in three families. No pancreatic cancer was found in relatives but an attentive survey has to be proposed.
