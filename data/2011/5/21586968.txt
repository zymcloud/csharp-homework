Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer with a high propensity for local recurrence. The incidence of metastases from BCC is rare. We report a 65-year-old man who had BCC of the medial canthus of the left eye. In the 10-year period, he had been operated on approximately 12 times because of local recurrences. Three years after the last operation, he had a suspicious lesion on the operated area and a lumbar pain. Radiologic examination showed multiple metastatic skeletal and liver lesions. He was referred to the oncology department for radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
