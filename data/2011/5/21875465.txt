Objective:To investigate the expression of RKIP, p65 and pERK in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and theIr correlation with invasion and metastasis of HCC.Methods:Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of RKIP mRNA. The expression levels of RKIP, p65 and pERK proteins in HCC tumor and peritumoral tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the relationship between their expression and clinicopathological parameters.Results:RKIP protein expression level (RKIP/actin) was 0.579 ± 0.380 in HCCs, 1.178 ± 0.659 in peritumoral tissues and 1.115 ± 0.442 in normal liver tissues. The pERK protein level was 1.023 ± 0.478, 0.605 ± 0.367 and 0.461 ± 0.293, p65 protein level was 0.83 ± 0.376, 0.63 ± 0.337 and 0.466 ± 0.345, respectively. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the RKIP positive rates in HCCs, peritumoral tissues and normal liver tissues, were 22.2%, 86.0%, and 93.8%, positive rates of p65 were 73.6%, 56.0% and 37.5%, positive rates of pERK were 65.3%, 38.0% and 31.3%, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in RKIP protein expression levels (P 0.05) among HCC tumors, peritumoral tissues and normal liver tissues. The p65-positive and pERK-positive rates were higher in tumor tissues than that in peritumoral tissues and in normal liver tissues (P Conclusions:Our findings indicate that the down-regulation of RKIP expression may serve as a predictive marker for HCC development, progression and metastasis, which may contribute to the elevated ERK activity. The inhibiting effect of RKIP on invasion and metastasis of liver cancer cells may be due to the down-regulation of pERK expression rather than p65 expression.
