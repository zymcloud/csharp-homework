Snake venom cystatin (sv-cystatin) is a member of the cystatin family of cysteine protease inhibitors. To further evaluate the possibility of sv-cystatin in cancer therapy, this study examined the effects of sv-cystatin on the invasion and metastasis of liver cancer cells (MHCC97H) in vitro and in vivo as well as the underlying mechanism. sv-cystatin cDNA was transfected into MHCC97H cells and the anti-invasion and antimetastasis effects of sv-cystatin were determined using migration and matrigel invasion assays and a lung-metastasis mice model. The results suggest that sv-cyst clone (sv-cystatin expression in MHCC97H cells) delayed the invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental, mock and si-sv-cyst clone cells (inhibited sv-cystatin expression by siRNA). The decreased activities of cathepsin B, MMP-2 and MMP-9 and EMT change index including higher E-cadherin, lower N-cadherin and decreased Twist activity were observed in the sv-cyst clone, which contributes to the change in invasion and metastasis ability of MHCC97H cells. This study provides evidence that expression of the sv-cystatin gene in MHCC97H cells inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis through the reduction of the proteinases activity and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), which might contribute to the anticancer research of the sv-cystatin protein.
