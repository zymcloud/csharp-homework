Background:The serum p53 antibody (s-p53 Ab) is a valuable prognostic factor for carcinomas, but its common detection method, based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), needs to be improved due to low sensitivity. Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is widely used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China, forecasting chemoresistance is still a pressing problem.Methods:Hybrid phage and wild-type p53 protein (wt p53 protein) were produced before the establishment of phage-ELISA and p53-ELISA. S-p53 Abs of 829 patients with various types of cancer was detected by a double ELISA system. 47 ΙΙΙ stage NSCLC patients treated with mitomycin, vindesine and cisplatin (MCV)-based NACT were chosen for s-p53 Abs, carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 12-5 predictive value analysis.Results:Through the combination of p53-ELISA and phage-ELISA (p53-phage ELISA), the sensitivity of s-p53 Abs in lung, breast, colorectal, gastric, esophageal, liver and ovarian cancer increased to 39.0%, 33.3%, 41.7%, 32.1%, 30.9%, 23.1% and 43.2% respectively. S-p53 Abs proved to correlate with nodal involvement, TNM stage, histological type (in lung cancer) or tumor size (in gastric cancer). As for the 47 ΙΙΙ stage NSCLC treated with NACT, s-p53 Abs and CA12-5 remarkably decreased after NACT treatment (P=0.034 and P=0.007) and pre-NACT low s-p53 Abs correlated with high objective chemoresponse rate (P=0.016).Conclusions:p53-phage ELISA system has an edge over single p53-ELISA. S-p53 Abs level correlates with cancer patients' clinicalpathological parameters and can predict the chemoresponse of ΙΙΙ stage NSCLC patients during MCV-based NACT treatment.
