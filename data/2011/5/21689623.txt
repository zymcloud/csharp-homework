Management of pediatric liver tumors has significantly improved over the last 2 decades. The management options for hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) are not well defined. In the pediatric context, the main clinical aims are to reduce chemotherapy toxicity (predominantly ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity) in children treated for hepatoblastoma and to investigate additional modes of treatment for HCC. An increasing number of children develop HCC in the background of chronic liver disease, and screening methods need to be better observed.
