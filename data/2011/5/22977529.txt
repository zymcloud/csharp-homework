Homeobox containing 1 (HMBOX1) is a novel transcription factor. However, the expression of HMBOX1 and its functions in human cancer tissues and cell lines have not been fully defined. We generated two specific monoclonal antibodies, 2A5F4 and 4A4F2, against human HMBOX1. In the present study, these two anti-HMBOX1 antibodies were used to investigate the protein expression profile of HMBOX1 in various human cancer tissues and cell lines. The results showed that HMBOX1 in kidney tissue was mainly expressed in the renal tubule; the expression level of HMBOX1 was much higher in clear-cell carcinoma of the kidney originating from the renal tubule. Additionally, high levels of HMBOX1 protein were detected not only in pancreatic cancer tissue but also in the adjacent normal tissue. Notably, the expression level of HMBOX1 in liver cancer was dramatically decreased compared with that in the adjacent normal tissue. Abnormal expression of HMBOX1 in different types of carcinoma tissues suggests that HMBOX1 may be involved in the pathobiology of tumors.
