Background:Previous studies suggest that annonaceous may cause permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) function to abate, leading to cell apoptosis. It has also been reported that annonaceous acetogenins affect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in the G1 phase, leading to apoptosis. Desacetyluvaricin (Des), a new type of annonaceous acetogenin monomer, has a significant effect on HCC, with few side effects.Objectives:To investigate the effect of Des on the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and P53 protein in HCC.Materials and methods:HCC HepG2.2.15 cell was cultured by routine method. HepG2.2.15 cells were divided into three groups: control group, treated with Des and DDP (cisplatin) which were examined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry for expression of TLR4 and P53.Results:TLR4 was expressed by more cells in the Des group than in the cisplatin or serum-only groups (71.94%, 42.64%, and 37.16%, respectively; Des vs.cisplatin: p 0.05). P53 was expressed by more cells in the Des and cisplatin groups than in the serum-only group (32.6%, 31.5% and 3.3%, respectively; Des vs. serum only, p 0.05).Conclusions:Des increases TLR4 and P53 expression in HCC cells. Improved immune recognition by the former effect and induction of apoptosis by the latter could be the mechanisms of Des's clinical effects on HCC.
