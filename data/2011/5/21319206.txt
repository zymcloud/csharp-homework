A series of 1-aryl-3-isopropylamino-1-propanone hydrochlorides 1 and a related heterocyclic analog 2 as candidate antineoplastic agents were prepared and the rationale for designing these compounds is presented. A specific objective in this study is the discovery of novel compounds possessing growth-inhibiting properties of hepatoma cells. The compounds in series 1 and 2 were prepared and their structures established unequivocally. X-ray crystallography of two representative compounds 1d and 1g were achieved. Over half of the compounds are more potent than 5-fluorouracil which is an established drug used in treating liver cancers. QSAR evaluations and molecular modeling studies were undertaken with a view to detecting some physicochemical parameters which govern cytotoxic potencies. A number of guidelines for amplification of the project have been formulated.
