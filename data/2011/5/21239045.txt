Although evidence has shown that both the mammalian target of rapamycin and β-catenin are involved in hepatocellular carcinoma, little is known about their relationship in pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. To investigate the expression of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin and β-catenin and their prognostic impacts, as well as their relationship in hepatocellular carcinoma, we analyzed 63 human hepatocellular carcinoma samples by immunohistochemistry. Phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin cytoplasmic and β-catenin cytoplasmic/nuclear-positive immunoreactivities were observed in 63.5% (40/63) and 55.6% (35/63) of the hepatocellular carcinoma specimens, respectively. Significant associations were found between cytoplasmic β-catenin and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin expression and tumor size (both P
