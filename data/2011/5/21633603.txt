Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has become the standard treatment modality for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nonetheless, the clinical outcomes in patients with unresectable HCC are often unsatisfactory, especially in those with recurrent HCC. H101, an E1B gene deleted adenovirus, is known to have a significant antitumor activity. In addition, local injection of H101 can enhance the effect of antitumor therapies (chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Transarterial H101 gene injection in combination with TACE may help to control refractory and recurrent HCC. In this study, we report a 55-year-old patient with recurrent HCC which was treated with transarterial injection of H101 in combination with TACE, leading to a good clinical prognosis of the patient.
