A 64-year-old man complained of pain in his left humerus. A histopathological examination of biopsy specimens taken from the lesion revealed a hepatocellular carcinoma. No primary hepatic lesion was revealed in a subsequent examination performed at this time. Enhanced computed tomography examination of the abdomen 14 months later, showed a nodular lesion, approximately 15 mm in diameter, therefore a partial hepatectomy was performed. The lesion was histopathologically diagnosed as a moderately-poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. The inability to identify the primary hepatocellular carcinoma is quite rare, and the present case may be the first report of the discovery of the primary hepatocellular cancer after the diagnosis of a secondary lesion.
