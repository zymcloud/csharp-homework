Sorafenib is a kinase-targeted drug that has high efficacy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to determine whether sorafenib is more effective than hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) for HCC. Twenty patients treated with sorafenib (sorafenib group) initiated at 800 mg/day and 45 patients treated with HAIC (HAIC group) for unresectable Child-Pugh A advanced HCC were investigated retrospectively. The treatment effect was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). As a result, the overall response rate was significantly lower in the sorafenib group than in the HAIC group (P=0.03), while the disease control and survival rates did not differ between the two groups. In the sorafenib group, treatment was discontinued in 19 patients, including 12 due to side effects. In subgroups of patients treated with sorafenib, the survival rate was significantly lower in patients (n=11) administered sorafenib for
