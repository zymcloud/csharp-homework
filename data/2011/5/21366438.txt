This video describes the techniques necessary to perform left hepatectomy (including removal of hepatic segments I-IV) for secondary cancers using totally laparoscopic techniques. Extra-parenchymal control of hepatic inflow will be emphasized. Methods of hepatic parenchymal transection using the ultrasonic shears and laparoscopic bipolar device will be shown. Short-term oncologic outcomes regarding margin status and lymph node retrieval will be discussed. These procedures should currently be performed in high-volume cancer centers with expertise in minimally invasive techniques.
