Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a well-known consequence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection mainly in cirrhotic patients. Associations of other malignancies such as cholangiocellular carcinoma and B-cell malignancies with HCV are less well known. Here we review pathophysiological aspects of malignancies associated with HCV infection. A case report of HCV-related HCC and B-cell lymphoma illustrates the increased risk for HCV-infected patients to develop other malignancies besides HCC.
