A 83-year-old male was referred to our hospital for further examination of abnormal shadow on chest radiography. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor mass in his right lung. Bronchoscopy brushing cytology revealed non-small cell lung carcinoma and right middle lobectomy was performed. Histological findings showed large cell carcinoma comprised of spindle cell component, finally diagnosing as pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung. Although he was diagnosed as pT2N0M0 (stage IA) after the operation, massive liver metastasis was found 7 months later. We report this case with references to the literatures on pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung.
