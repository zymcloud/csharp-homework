Among a cohort of 414 liver transplantations (OLT) performed form 1996 to 2009, we analyzed 86 patients (20.7%) who were affected by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) superimposed on cirrhosis, including 82 with a preoperative diagnosis of tumor; 4 cases had the diagnosis established upon histologic examination after hepatectomy. The gender of 75 patients was male (91.5%), and female in 7 cases (8.5%). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 10 (range, 6-23). The underlying liver disease was hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis (41.46%), hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis (15.6%), or alcohol-related cirrhosis (29.3%); cryptogenic; HCV+HIV; HBV+HIV; or HCV+HBV+HIV cirrhosis were present in an other few patients. The diagnosis of HCC and the preoperative staging were defined through radiologic evaluations, without biopsy confirmation in any case. All patients underwent pretransplant radiologic treatments to reduce the drop-out risk while a waiting OLT; OLT was performed for HCC patients within the Milan criteria. Upon histologic examination, the median HCC necrosis was 57 Â± 36%; in 22 cases (26.8%), there were no necrotizing effects. Forty patients (48.8%) display a satisfying degree of disease control with 26 patients (31.7%) downstaged effect; 15 patients (18.3%) showed neoplastic progression with advanced neoplastic disease exceeding the Milan criteria at hepatectomy. One patient had nonevaluable necrosis (1.2%). Our experience showed preoperative radiologic treatments to be not curative but serving as a bridge to OLT.
