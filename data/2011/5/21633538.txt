This paper reports the first case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma with lymph node metastasis treated by sorafenib combined with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin, with a partial response and normalization of Î± fetoprotein, which allowed curative surgery. The potential synergy between these three drugs needs to be confirmed, and is currently being investigated in a randomized phase II trial.
