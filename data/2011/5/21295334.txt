Introduction:Prognostic value of complete macroscopic resection of primary disease has been reported and confirmed in several publications. Published data indicate that extensive upper abdominal disease involving the hepatic pedicle and celiac trunk is associated with an abortion of the surgical procedure or with suboptimal residual disease.Methods:All patients who had disease at the porta hepatis or celiac lymph node resection as part of cytoreductive surgery were included. Medical and operative records with particular emphasis on extent and distribution of disease spread, number of peritonectomy procedures, visceral resections, and lymphadenectomy procedures were examined.Results:A total of 28 patients who underwent some kind of celiac lymph node resection or resection of metastatic involvement of the porta hepatis were included. Median preoperative serum Ca-125 level was 78U/ml (range, 30-2950U/ml), and median ascites volume was 1900ml (range, 0-10,000ml). Of the 28 patients, 23 underwent supra-radical surgery for diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis. Median operative time was 252minutes (range, 100-540minutes). Complete cytoreduction to CCO was achieved in all except one case, who was cytoreduced to millimetric residue. Fifteen patients had positive celiac nodes and nineteen patients had peritoneal disease in the porta hepatis region.Discussion:Resection of enlarged nodes and metastatic disease to the porta hepatis is feasible with an acceptable morbidity. The decision to undergo an aggressive cytoreductive surgery is based on appropriate patient selection depending on the extension of surgical procedure, on medical comorbidities, and on the potential to tolerate an extensive procedure, rather than on specific anatomic locations.
