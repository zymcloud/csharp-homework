Objective:To clarify the value of resection of gallbladder cancer involving the extrahepatic bile duct.Background:: Several recent studies have proven that jaundice and extrahepatic biliary involvement are independent predictors of a poor outcome. Only a few authors recommend resection of such advanced disease.Methods:One hundred patients with pT3/4, pN0/1, M0 disease were the subjects of this study. Mortality and long-term outcome were analyzed using a prospectively collected database.Results:The only factor associated with mortality in univariate and multivariate analyses was intraoperative blood loss. The 5-year survival rate and median survival time were 23% and 1.5 years for patients with pathologic extrahepatic biliary invasion (pEBI), and 54% and 15.4 years for patients without pEBI. Twelve patients with pEBI survived beyond 5 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that R1/2 resection and combined resection of adjacent organs other than the liver and extrahepatic bile duct (CRAO) were independent predictors of poor outcome. Five-year survival rate and median survival time after R0 resection without CRAO were 36% and 3.8 years even in patients with pEBI. In contrast, after R0 resection with CRAO 5-year survival and median survival time were 16% and 0.8 years, respectively.Conclusions:Patients with advanced gallbladder cancer with pEBI are candidates for resection when distant metastases are absent and R0 resection is achievable. When CRAO is unnecessary, surgical resection should be aggressively planned.
