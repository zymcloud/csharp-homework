Effects of α-, β-, γ- and δ-tocopherols on the proliferation and invasion of AH109A hepatoma cells and their modes of action were investigated. Four tocopherols inhibited the invasion as well as the proliferation of AH109A cells. Their inhibitory effects were more prominent on the invasion than on the proliferation. At 1 µM, α-tocopherol showed most potent anti-invasive activity without any influence on the proliferation. We have previously demonstrated that reactive oxygen species increase the invasion of AH109A cells. α-Tocopherol suppressed the reactive oxygen species-induced invasion but failed to suppress the reactive oxygen species-induced rises in intracellular peroxide level. GF 109203X, a protein kinase C inhibitor, decreased the invasive activity of AH109A cells. In contrast, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, a protein kinase C activator, increased the invasive capacity of AH109A cells. α-Tocopherol suppressed the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced increase in the invasion, and canceled the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced rises in protein kinase C activity and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. These results suggest that tocopherols, especially α-tocopherol, possess inhibitory effect more strongly on the invasion of AH109A cells than on the proliferation. They also suggest that the anti-invasive activity of α-tocopherol is raised through suppression of PKC/ERK signaling.
