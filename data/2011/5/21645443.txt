Objective:To explore the effects of percutaneous transhepatic radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) combined with tumor edge of percutaneous absolute ethanol injection (PEI) on liver cancer adjacent to major blood vessels.Methods:Seventy five patients with liver cancer adjacent to major blood vessels were randomly divided into two groups: PRFA+PEI therapy group (38 cases) and PRFA control group (37 cases). Tumor necrosis rate, AFP levels, local recurrence rate, median for survival time and cum survival were used as the evaluation index to evaluate the efficacies of the two methods.Results:Tumor necrosis rates of the therapy group and the control group were 84.2% and 54.1% (P Conclusion:PEI as a supplementary treatment of PRFA can effectively improve the treatment of liver cancer adjacent to major blood vessels and significantly reduce the local recurrence rate and improve long-term survival rates.
