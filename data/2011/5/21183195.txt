Sonodynamic therapy with pyropheophorbide-a methyl ester (MPPa) presents a promising aspect in treating liver cancer. The present study aims to investigate the mitochondrial damage of liver cancer cells induced by MPPa-mediated sonodynamic action. Mouse hepatoma cell line H(22) cells were incubated with MPPa (2 μM) for 20 h and then exposed to ultrasound with an intensity of 0.97 W/cm(2) for 8 s. Cytotoxicity was investigated 24h after sonodynamic action using MTT assay and light microscopy. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was analyzed using flow cytometry with rhodamine 123 staining and ultrastructural changes were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The cytotoxicity of MPPa-mediated SDT on H(22) cell line was 73.00±3.42%, greater than ultrasound treatment alone (28.12±5.19%) significantly while MPPa treatment alone had no significant effect on H(22) cells. Moreover, after MPPa-mediated SDT cancer cells showed swollen mitochondria under TEM and a significant collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. Our findings demonstrated that MPPa-mediated SDT could remarkably induce cell death of H(22) cells, and highlighted that mitochondrial damage might be an important cause of cell death induced by MPPa-mediated SDT.
