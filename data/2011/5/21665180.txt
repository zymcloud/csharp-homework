Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and severe diseases in the world. Besides the influence of environmental factors, such as viral infection, an increasing number of novel genetic components identified by genome-wide association studies have been associated with predisposition to HCC. Thus, studies focusing on functional variants in these findings are indispensable. In the present study, based on in-silico analysis, we carried out a case-control study in a Chinese population (207 cases and 245 controls) to investigate the association between HCC susceptibility with a 7 base pair (bp) insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs3917) in the 3'UTR of COL1A2. Our results showed that the ins/del + del/del genotype had an odds ratio of 1.76 (95% C.I.=1.03-3.01; P=0.028) for developing HCC compared to the ins/ins genotype. Carriers for the "del" allele of rs3917 were associated with a 1.73-fold increased risk for HCC (95% C.I.=1.06-2.84; P(trend)=0.02). Computational modeling suggests that this polymorphism is located in the hsa-let-7 g potential target sequence in the COL1A2 3' untranslated region. Our data suggest that most likely, common genetic changes in COL1A2 may influence HCC risk, at least in part by let-7 g-mediated regulation, which is possibly involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. The replication of our studies in other populations will further strengthen our understanding of this association.
