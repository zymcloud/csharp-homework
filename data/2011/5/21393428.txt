Previously, we have shown that bortezomib overcame TRAIL resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells via the inhibition of Akt. Here, we report that bortezomib sensitizes these TRAIL-resistant cells, including Huh-7, Hep3B, and Sk-Hep1, to CS-1008, a humanized agonistic antihuman death receptor 5 antibody. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) mediated the sensitizing effect of bortezomib to CS-1008 through inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity. Combination treatment of bortezomib and CS-1008 downregulated CIP2A in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and increased PP2A activity in HCC cells. Importantly, ectopic expression of CIP2A decreased Akt-related PP2A activity, indicating that CIP2A negatively regulates Akt-related PP2A activity in HCC cells. Moreover, silencing CIP2A by short interfering RNA enhanced CS-1008-induced apoptosis in HCC cells and ectopic expression of CIP2A in HCC cells abolished CS-1008-induced apoptosis, indicating that CIP2A plays an important role in the sensitizing effect of bortezomib to CS-1008. Finally, our in vivo data showed that CS-1008 and bortezomib combination treatment decreased tumor growth significantly. In conclusion, bortezomib sensitized HCC cells to CS-1008 through the inhibition of CIP2A.
