Introduction and objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth leading cause of cancer. In western countries its impact is steadily growing and most of these tumors arise in cirrhotic liver. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of HCC developing in noncirrhotic patients.Methods:We conducted a retrospective review of 469 patients diagnosed with HCC between January 2003 and December 2007. Patients who met the histological criteria, or a combination of clinical, laboratory, imaging and hemodynamic criteria for the absence of cirrhosis were included.Results:We identified 29 patients with a diagnosis of HCC in non-cirrhotic liver (6.2%). Most (86.2%) were men and the median age was 61.6 (23 - 82) years. The most frequent histology of the liver was mild-moderate liver fibrosis (68.9%) and 62.1% of the patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. HCC was a solitary nodule in 86.2%, and the median size of the main nodule was 46 (20 - 150) mm. Macroscopic vascular invasion was demonstrated in two patients and bone metastases in a further two patients. Active treatment was provided in 25 patients, consisting of tumoral resection in 15, radiofrequency ablation in six and transarterial chemoembolization in four. The overall cumulative survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was 84.3%, 67.2% and 50.1%, respectively.Conclusion:HCC arising in non-cirrhotic liver is uncommon and there is wide tumor extension at diagnosis. Nevertheless, in most patients, treatment with curative intent can be applied, achieving better survival than that expected patients with cirrhosis.
