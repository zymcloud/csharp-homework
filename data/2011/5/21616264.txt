Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in children is rare, and the prognosis has been poor because of its advanced stage at diagnosis and unresponsiveness to chemotherapy. We report a 13-year-old boy with ruptured HCC in the left trisegment. When hemostasis of the ruptured surface was achieved in the emergency operation, the left branch of the portal vein and the left hepatic artery were ligated at the same time. The volume of the future liver remnant (FLR), that is, his right posterior sector, increased from 56% on admission to 70% of his standard liver volume on day 2. Blood level of serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist ІІ started to decrease immediately. Left trisegmentectomy was successfully performed 10 days later, followed by chemotherapy. He has been well with a 2-year survival without recurrence. When the FLR is considered relatively small for a major hepatic resection, the selective ligation of the portal vein and the hepatic artery, which feed HCC, seems to be beneficial. This is because it may induce enlargement of the FLR, increasing the safety of the hepatectomy as preoperative portal vein embolization does before a major hepatectomy in adult patients with HCC, and the latter suppresses the tumor while waiting for the planned hepatectomy.
