Objective:To study the effect of Eupolyphaga fibrinolyric protein (EFP) on microvessel density (MVD) and the expression of vascular endthelial growth factor in transplantation S180 and H22 mice.Methods:The MVD in tumor was measured with immunohistochemical SP method and the VEGF level in serum was measured with ELISA method.Results:Compared with the control group, EFP could significantly reduce the microvessel density and decrease the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor.Conclusion:EFP has the effect of anti-angiogenesis.
