A 64-year-old male visited our hospital complaining of epigastric pain, and was diagnosed as esophageal cancer with multiple liver metastases. Histological examinations revealed squamous cell carcinoma. He had serious liver dysfunctions and his general conditions were severe, expressed as 3 of the performance status. He was treated using radiotherapy and chemotherapy with low-dose nedaplatin and 5-fluorouracil after the fully sufficient informed consent was taken. As for adverse events, Grade 2 of thrombocytopenia was only observed. Liver tumors responded to anticancer drug treatment immediately, and liver functions were almost normalized. The chemotherapy using low-dose nedaplatin and 5-FU combined with the radiotherapy was feasible and effective to patients with poor conditions.
