We encountered a case of multiple metastatic brain tumors with simultaneous multiple cerebral hemorrhages. A 45-year-old male suffered from sudden left hemiplegia and was admitted to our hospital. CT scans on admission revealed multiple cerebral hemorrhages with surrounding brain edema in the right frontal lobe, left frontal lobe, right occipital lobe and right basal ganglia. On full-body examination, renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney and multiple metastatic tumors in the lung, liver and vertebral body were identified. We continued conservative therapy, but the patient's condition worsened and he died 36 days later. The autopsy findings indicated that all hemorrhages had occurred in the necrotic tissue associated with the metastatic brain tumors. Simultaneous multiple cerebral hemorrhages caused by metastatic brain tumors are very rare, and the differential diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage due to metastatic brain tumor and hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage is difficult. The present case indicates that metastatic brain tumor should be taken into consideration in cases with simultaneous multiple intracerebral hemorrhages.
