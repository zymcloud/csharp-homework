Background:The antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab with infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) is a standard first-line treatment option for metastatic colorectal cancer. However, clinical data for capecitabine and irinotecan (XELIRI) with bevacizumab are limited.Patients and methods:A retrospective study was conducted on 139 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to assess the efficacy and safety of first-line bevacizumab in combination with XELIRI or FOLFIRI. Primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate and radical resection rate. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety.Results:No significant differences in efficacy were observed between patients administered XELIRI or FOLFIRI with bevacizumab. The ORR, median OS and PFS and recorded adverse events (AEs) were comparable to those previously reported, with no new or unexpected AEs observed.Conclusion:Bevacizumab is similarly efficacious and well tolerated when administered with XELIRI or FOLFIRI.
