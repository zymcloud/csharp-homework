Objective:The objective of this study was to describe the development and experience in resection of tumor at the porta hepatis in patients with ovarian cancer by an interdisciplinary team approach.Methods:From August 2007 to June 2009, 11 women (2 primary and 9 recurrent ovarian cancers) underwent extended cytoreductive surgery including resection of tumor at the porta hepatis by hepatobiliary surgeons.Results:Tumor resection at the porta hepatis was required in 7.1% of the patients (11/155) during the study period. The median tumor size of the porta hepatis was 2.0cm (range, 0.7-4cm). All visible tumors at the porta hepatis were completely resected with co-operation of hepatobiliary surgeons. Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in all patients. There was no significant morbidity related to tumor resection of the porta hepatis and mortality associated with surgery. Five of 11 patients had recurrent disease at median 8months (range, 1-13) after the surgery with a median follow-up of 8months (range, 3-21months).Conclusion:Tumor resection at the porta hepatis is feasible with acceptable morbidities in patients with ovarian cancer by an interdisciplinary team approach with hepatobiliary surgeons. Long term follow up is needed to know the impact on survival.
