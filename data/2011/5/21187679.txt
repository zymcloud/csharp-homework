A 13-year-old neutered female Shih Tzu was referred for investigation of a cranial abdominal mass. Investigations including conventional radiography, abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography confirmed the mass in the caudate lobe of the liver. As a collateral vein originating from the caudal vena cava (CVC) communicated with the azygos vein, the CVC was ligated and transected cranial to the right renal vein and cranial to the mass under temporary occlusion of the thoracic descending aorta and posthepatic CVC. The mass combined with the CVC was excised. The mass was confirmed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This report describes the first case with successful en bloc resection of a large HCC involving the CVC in a dog.
