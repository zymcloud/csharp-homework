In this study, a rhamnose-binding lectin from the roe of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) was purified and characterized, and its biological activities were examined in several model systems. Chinook salmon roe lectin had a molecular mass of 30 kDa and agglutinated rabbit and bovine erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity of the lectin was not affected by metal ions. The lectin was stable up to 70 Â°C and between pH 4 and pH 11. Chinook salmon roe lectin did not exert antifungal activity toward the fungal species tested and did not exhibit mitogenic response toward mouse splenocytes up to a concentration of 5 mg/mL. The lectin had selective antiproliferative activity toward human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and hepatoma Hep G2 cells. It also induced the production of nitric oxide from mouse peritoneal macrophages. This is the first report that demonstrates these biological activities from chinook salmon roe lectin.
