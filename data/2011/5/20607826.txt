Many tumor cells are characterized by a dysregulated glucose metabolism associated with increased glycolysis in the presence of oxygen ("Warburg Effect"). Here, we analyzed for the first time a possible link between glucose metabolism and immune cell infiltration in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RCC specimens revealed a highly significant increase in the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and glucose-transporter 1 (GLUT-1) compared to the corresponding normal kidney tissue on mRNA level. Accordingly, tumor cell lines of different origin such as RCC, melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma strongly expressed LDHA and GLUT-1 compared to their nonmalignant counterparts. In line with this finding, tumor cells secreted high amounts of lactate. High expression of GLUT-1 and LDH5, a tetramer of 4 LDHA subunits, was confirmed by tissue microarray analysis of 249 RCC specimens. Overall, 55/79 (69.6%) and 46/71 (64.7%) cases of clear cell carcinoma showed a constitutive, but heterogeneous expression of GLUT-1 and LDH5, respectively. The number of CD3(+), CD8(+) and FOXP3(+) T cells was significantly elevated in RCC lesions compared to normal kidney epithelium, but effector molecules such as granzyme B and perforin were decreased in tumor infiltrating T cells. Of interest, further analysis revealed an inverse correlation between GLUT-1 expression and the number of CD8(+) T cells in RCC lesions. Together, our data suggest that an accelerated glucose metabolism in RCC tissue is associated with a low infiltration of CD8(+) effector T cells. Targeting the glucose metabolism may represent an interesting tool to improve the efficacy of specific immunotherapeutic approaches in RCC.
