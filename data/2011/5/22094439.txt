Purpose:The clinicopathological features of colon cancer differ between proximal and distal sites; however, the influence of tumor location on liver metastasis has not been fully examined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in the features of liver metastasis between proximal and distal colon cancer.Methods:The clinicopathological data from 931 colon cancer patients who were treated surgically were examined retrospectively using a multivariate analysis.Results:The incidence of synchronous liver metastasis was 7.1% (31/438) in proximal colon patients and 11.6% (57/493) in distal colon patients. Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed distal colon cancer to be a risk factor for synchronous liver metastasis.Conclusion:The incidence of synchronous liver metastasis differs between proximal and distal colon cancer.
