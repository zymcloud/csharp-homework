In the present study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of crude extract of Scutellaria Barbate (CE-SB) on mouse hepatoma H22 cells. The MTT assay was used to determine the growth inhibition of H22 cells in vitro. The in vivo therapeutic effects of CE-SB were determined using H22 tumor bearing mice. Besides, the body weight, tumor weight, thymus index and spleen index of H22 bearing mice were also measured. The tumor inhibitory rate (IR) was calculated according to the mean weight of tumor (MWT). The phagocytotic function of macrophages was examined by observing peritoneal macrophages phagocytize chicken RBC. The results showed that CE-SB could inhibit the growth of hepatoma H22 Cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, CE-SB could improve immune function of H22 tumor bearing mice. Together these results indicate that CE-SB has antitumor activity and seems to be safe and effective for the use of anti-tumor therapy.
