Objective:To study the expression of mPGES-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), observe the effect of MK886 on down-regulation of mPGES-1 gene expression on the biology of human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 and to investigate its significance in the occurrence, progression, metastasis and invasion.Methods:HCC tissues, para-carcinoma tissues, far-carcinoma tissues and normal liver tissues were collected. The expressions of mPGES-1 were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. The proliferation, adherence, migration and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells interfered by MK886 were assessed by MTT and transwell technique respectively.Results:The expression of mPGES-1 in HCCs was higher than that in normal liver tissues (P Conclusion:Over-expression of mPGES-1 was associated with the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC. The down-regulation of mPGES-1 gene expression might indicated the decrease of the invasion and metastasis of HCC.
