Purpose:This study is to evaluate reproducibility of hepatic tumors in end-expiration and end-inspiration on free-breathing, also measure shift of hepatic tumor location in pulsed proton beams exposure in end-expiration in order to estimate feasible planning target volume (PTV) margin.Materials and methods:Pairs (1232) of anterior and lateral radiographs from 30 patients (628 end-expiration and 604 end-inspiration phases) were analyzed using fiducial markers adjacent to the tumors. By using the co-ordinates of the marker centroid of mass related to the isocenter, intrafractional variation was compared in end-expiration and end-inspiration, and a feasible PTV margin was generated using the measured motion.Results:The average internal motion in end-expiration was 1.1mm, which was significantly smaller than that in end-inspiration. The mean deviation from the plan was -0.1, 0.3, and 0.1mm in the left-right (LR), cranio-cepharal (CC), and anterior-posterior (AP) directions, respectively. The estimated PTV margins were 3.2, 3.5, and 4.6mm, in the LR, CC, and AP directions, respectively.Conclusions:It was indicated that localization of the targets was more reproducibility in end-expiration than that in end-inspiration. Also, feasible and practical margin values were obtained. These should contribute accuracy of respiration synchronized proton radiotherapy for liver tumors.
