The mouse-human chimeric anti-epidermal growth factor receptor vIII (EGFRvIII) antibody C12 is a promising candidate for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, 3 processes were successfully developed to produce C12 by cultivation of recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-DG44) cells in serum-free medium. The effect of inoculum density was evaluated in batch cultures of shaker flasks to obtain the optimal inoculum density of 5 Ã— 10(5) cells/mL. Then, the basic metabolic characteristics of CHO-C12 cells were studied in stirred bioreactor batch cultures. The results showed that the limiting concentrations of glucose and glutamine were 6 and 1 mM, respectively. The culture process consumed significant amounts of aspartate, glutamate, asparagine, serine, isoleucine, leucine, and lysine. Aspartate, glutamate, asparagine, and serine were particularly exhausted in the early growth stage, thus limiting cell growth and antibody synthesis. Based on these findings, fed-batch and perfusion processes in the bioreactor were successfully developed with a balanced amino acid feed strategy. Fed-batch and especially perfusion culture effectively maintained high cell viability to prolong the culture process. Furthermore, perfusion cultures maximized the efficiency of nutrient utilization; the mean yield coefficient of antibody to consumed glucose was 44.72 mg/g and the mean yield coefficient of glutamine to antibody was 721.40 mg/g. Finally, in small-scale bioreactor culture, the highest total amount of C12 antibody (1,854 mg) was realized in perfusion cultures. Therefore, perfusion culture appears to be the optimal process for small-scale production of C12 antibody by rCHO-C12 cells.
