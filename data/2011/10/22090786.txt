Aim:To investigate the apoptotic activities of casticin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and its molecular mechanisms.Methods:PLC/PRF/5 and Hep G2 cell lines were cultured in vitro and the inhibitory effect of casticin on the growth of cells was detected by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolim bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptotic cell death was examined using the cell apoptosis enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection kit, flow cytometry (FCM) after propidium iodide (PI) staining and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. The caspase activities were measured using ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was evaluated by FCM after dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe labeling. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) content was measured using a glutathione assay kit. The expression of death receptor (DR)4 and DR5 proteins was analyzed by Western blotting and FCM.Results:Casticin significantly inhibited the growth of human HCC (PLC/PRF/5 and Hep G2) cells in a dose-dependent manner (P Conclusion:Casticin-induced apoptosis of HCC cells is involved in GSH depletion and DR5 upregulation.
