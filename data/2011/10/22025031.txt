Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the third most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. Although major risk factors for the development of HCC have been defined, many aspects of the evolution of hepatocellular carcinogenesis and metastasis are still unknown. Suitable animal models are, therefore, essential to promote our understanding of the molecular, cellular and pathophysiological mechanisms of HCC and for the development of new therapeutic strategies. This Review provides an overview of animal models that are relevant to HCC development, metastasis and treatment. For HCC development, this Review focuses on transgenic mouse models of HBV and HCV infection, which provide experimental evidence that viral genes could initiate or promote liver carcinogenesis. Animal models of HCC metastasis provide platforms to elucidate the mechanisms of HCC metastasis, to study the interaction between the microenvironment and HCC invasion and to conduct intervention studies. In addition, animal models have been developed to investigate the effects of new treatment modalities. The criteria for establishing ideal HCC animal models are also discussed.
