Objective:Arterially directed therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma are used for patients who are not candidates for surgery or ablation and for those who need a bridge or down-staging to liver transplantation. These therapies seem to prolong the overall survival when compared with supportive care.Conclusion:Chemoembolization, particle embolization, drug-eluting beads, and radioembolization have been used for locoregional control. This review discusses patient selection, techniques, safety, clinical outcomes, and imaging findings related to these therapies.
