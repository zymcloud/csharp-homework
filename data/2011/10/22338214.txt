Objective:To investigate the effect of extract of ginkgo biloba leaf (EGb) during the formation of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:99 HBV transgenic mice were randomly divided into control group, high-dose group, low-dose group. High-dose group and low-dose group were intraperitoneal injected 35mg/(kg x d) and 17.5 mg/(kg x d) of the shuxuening injection. Control group without special treatment. The serological markers and immunohistochemical markers in liver tissue will be done at the first 12 months and 18 months.Results:(1) HBV transgenic mice can be found HCC at the 18 months. The incidence of HCC was lower in high-dose group and low-dose group, there was statistically different among the three groups. (2) The semi-quantitative scoring of liver HBx expression was highest in the control group at the 12 months. The semi-quantitative scoring of liver HBx, p53 and Bcl-2 expression was highest in the control group at the 18 months. They all appeared statistically different among the three groups. (3) Spearman correlation analysis showed that HCC incidence and liver tissue HBx, p53, Bcl-2 expression was a certain degree of positive correlation, r was 0.536, 0.487 and 0.403, P Conclusion:EGb can reduced the incidence of the HCC with HBV transgenic mice. The reason may be that the EGb can reduce liver HBx, p53, Bcl-2 protein expression in the HBV transgenic mice.
