Disseminated adiaspiromycosis is a rare infection that is sometimes associated with immunocompromised situations. We report the case of a patient, infected with human immunodeficiency virus and receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, who had a liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient presented skin and pulmonary lesions due to adiaspiromycosis during immunosuppressive therapy. A review of >60 cases in the literature shows that adiaspiromycosis is a rare infection and Emmonsia is a dimorphic fungus that is difficult to grow. It should be considered a possible diagnosis in case of fungal infection and pulmonary granulomatosis. We should be aware of emerging adiaspiromycosis in patients with risk factors of immunosuppression, particularly transplant recipients. In these patients in particular, liposomal amphotericin B therapy should be considered.
