Purpose:To evaluate the ability of multidetector row computed tomography (CT) to detect blood supply from the intercostal artery in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Between January 2003 and December 2007, angiography of the intercostal artery was performed in 93 patients (76 men and 17 women, mean age 58 years) with HCC who had also undergone multidetector row CT. CT scans and digital subtraction angiograms of these patients were retrospectively reviewed by two investigators in consensus to evaluate tumor feeding vessels. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors that predict the presence of an HCC blood supply from an intercostal artery.Results:Tumor staining fed by an intercostal artery was noted in 65 patients (70%; 112 tumor feeding vessels) by intercostal angiography. Readers interpreted that tumor feeding vessels were evident by CT in 35 (54%) of these 65 patients with tumor staining supplied by an intercostal artery by angiography. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a visible tumor feeding vessel by CT (P = .003) and hepatic artery attenuation by angiography (P = .014) were significantly related to the presence of a blood supply from an intercostal artery.Conclusions:Visualization of a tumor feeding vessel from the intercostal artery by multidetector row CT is an important sign of parasitic supply to an HCC.
