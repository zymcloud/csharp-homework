Objective:To express and purify the human scFv antibody, SA3, against the hepatoma fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein, and to observe the targeted capacity of fusion protein EGFP-SA3 in vivo.Methods:SA3 and EGFP genes were cloned into plasmid pET-25b(+) to construct the recombinant plasmid EGFP-SA3/pET-25b(+), followed by DNA sequencing. Then it was transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) and induced for fusion expression of EGFP-SA3 with IPTG. The expressed fusion protein EGFP-SA3 was purified and detected with SDS-PAGE. HepG2 cells were incubated with the fusion protein EGFP-SA3 in vitro, and the binding bioactivity was observed under the fluorescent microscope. Further more, we injected the EGFP-SA3 by caudal vein into nude mice planted by hepatoma and observed the whole body fluorescence image of EGFP.Results:SA3 and EGFP genes were successfully cloned into pET-25b(+), which was confirmed by restriction enzyme NcoI-XhoI or NcoI-EcoRI. A band migrated at the position 750 bp, same to EGFP gene, emerged when recombinant plasmid was digested by restriction enzyme NcoI-EcoRI. Similarly, a band, about 1 500 bp, emerged when digested by NcoI-XhoI. The open-reading frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fusion protein EGFP-SA3 was expressed as inclusion body. After purification and refolding, the result of immunofluorescence detection verified that EGFP-SA3 could specifically bind to HepG2 cells and maximum tumor penetration was at 24 h after the injection.Conclusion:The purified fusion protein EGFP-SA3 has strong binding capacity to HepG2 cells, indicating the scFv SA3 has a potential value as a targeting molecule for diagnosis and targeted therapy for liver cancer.
