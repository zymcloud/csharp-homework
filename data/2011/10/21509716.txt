Bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethanolic extract from the seeds of Antiaris toxicaria led to the isolation of three new cardiac glycosides named toxicarioside J, toxicarioside K, and toxicarioside L, together with a known glucostrophalloside. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including HRESIMS, UV, IR, and 1D, 2D NMR techniques. The cytotoxic activities of these cardiac glycosides against human gastric (SGC-7901) and human hepatoma (SMMC-7721) cell lines were evaluated, and all of them exhibited significant cytotoxicity.
