Mammalian cells respond to protein or amino acid (AA) limitation by activating a number of signaling pathways, collectively referred to as the AA response (AAR), that modulate a range of cellular functions, including transcriptional induction of target genes. This study demonstrates that in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, expression of c-JUN, JUN-B, c-FOS, and FOS-B was induced by the AAR, whereas JUN-D, FRA-1, and FRA-2 were not. Of the four activated FOS/JUN members, c-JUN made the largest contribution to the induction of several known AAR target genes. For several human liver, prostate, and ovarian cell lines, the AAR-induced increase in c-JUN expression was greater in transformed cells compared with nontransformed counterparts, an effect independent of cell growth rate. Thus far, the best characterized AA-responsive genes are all transcriptionally activated by ATF4, but the AAR-dependent induction of c-JUN transcription was ATF4-independent. The increased expression of c-JUN was dependent on ATF2 and on activation of the MEK-ERK and JNK arms of the MAPK signaling pathways. Formation of c-JUN-ATF2-activated heterodimers was increased after AA limitation, and c-JUN or ATF2 knockdown suppressed the induction of c-JUN and other AAR target genes. AA deprivation triggers a feed-forward process that involves phosphorylation of existing c-JUN protein by JNK and subsequent auto-activation of the c-JUN gene by recruitment of c-JUN and ATF2 to two AP-1 sites within the proximal promoter. The results document the novel observation that AP-1 sequences within the c-JUN gene can function as transcriptional amino acid-response elements.
