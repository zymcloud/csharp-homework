VLDL is produced by the liver. Its major protein is apoB100. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), reduces VLDL levels and is used therapeutically for hypertriglyceridemia. In model systems, DHA lowers VLDL secretion by inducing presecretory apoB100 degradation, a process dependent on PUFA-derived lipid peroxides. We hypothesized that superoxide (SO) was a major participant in DHA-induced apoB100 degradation, given its promotion of lipid peroxidation. SO levels in a model of VLDL metabolism, rat hepatoma McArdle cells, were either decreased by a mimetic of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) or by overexpressing SOD1 or increased by SOD1 siRNA. ApoB100 recovery was assessed by immunoprecipitation, SO by 2-hydroxyethidine, and lipid peroxides by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. The SOD1 mimetic or SOD1 overexpression reduced SO and inhibited apoB100 degradation in DHA-treated cells by up to 100%. Surprisingly, silencing SOD1 did not increase DHA-induced degradation, although levels of SO were higher (+44%); those of lipid peroxides were similar, and their reduction by Î±-tocopherol decreased degradation by 50%. SO is required for lipid peroxidation in DHA-induced apoB100 degradation, but it is the peroxide level that has a tighter relationship to the level of degradation and the regulation of VLDL production.
