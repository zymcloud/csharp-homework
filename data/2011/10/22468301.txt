Objective:To investigate the malignancy incidence among rubber manufacture and preliminary processing industrial workers in Hainan Province of China.Methods:A retrospective survey was conducted on 9 farms in Hainan covering workers who got malignant tumor between January 1, 2005 and October 31, 2010.Result:On average there were 10 320 workers worked on the 9 farms each year. Among them, 167 cases of malignancy were found. The morbidity was 279.01 every a hundred thousand and standardized morbidity was 159.03 every a hundred thousand; In comparison, we also investigated 14228 non-rubber-industry-related workers. 94 malignancy cases were found. The morbidity was 113.91 every a hundred thousand and standardized morbidity was 64.93 every a hundred thousand. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.01) meaning that rubber industrial workers in Hainan Province had a higher possibility of getting malignancy. Top 5 types of cancer found in this study were lung cancer (17.96%), liver cancer (17.36%), stomach cancer (13.17%), rectal cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 116 cases of these five types of cancer took up 69.45% of the total.Conclusions:Rubber industrial workers in Hainan have a higher morbidity of malignancy than other local industries.
