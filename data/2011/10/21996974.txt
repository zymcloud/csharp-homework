A 60-year-old man with liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C, who was receiving warfarin anticoagulation following acute myocardial infarction, was diagnosed with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple lung metastases, and began treatment with sorafenib 200 mg daily. From the treatment's start to 14 and 63 days later, sorafenib was increased to 400 mg and 600 mg, respectively. After increasing the quantity to 600 mg, he had an increase in PT-INR values and experienced a lower-extremity hemorrhage. For the patient with liver cirrhosis, who is receiving warfarin, PT-INR values might be elevated during the early period of sorafenib treatment dosage as for the increase in quantity. Therefore, when increasing dosage, a frequent measurement of PT-INR and a careful follow-up for PT-INR is necessary.
