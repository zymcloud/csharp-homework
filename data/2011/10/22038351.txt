This study investigated the expression profiles of IL-10 gene in three human hepatoma cell lines including Huh7, HepG2, and HepG2 transfected with a plasmid containing hepatitis B virus (HBV) named HepG2.2.15. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that IL-10 message RNA was absent in HepG2 and Huh7 cells, whereas it was present in HepG2.2.15 cells, which was consistent with ELISA result. Furthermore, except for lamivudine other antiviral treatments did not significantly decrease the HBV DNA level in HepG2.2.15 cells, while they had different effects on the expression of IL-10 protein, although stimulation by LPS had no significant effect. In addition, except for poly(I:C), the other treatments decreased the expression of IL-10 protein to different degrees, but had no significant effects on the expression of NF-ÎºB and MyD88. Meanwhile, all treatments we used had effect on the expression of STAT1. In conclusion, IL-10 was expressed in HepG2.2.15 cells and STAT1 pathway might be involved in the regulation of IL-10 expression in HepG2.2.15 cells, but it was not the sole pathway, the exact mechanism warrants further study.
