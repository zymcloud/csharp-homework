We developed a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) derivative with oleyl groups, so-called "cell adhesive", for the promotion of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell spheroids. Our approach was based on crosslinking of the cell membrane with a cell adhesive via a hydrophobic interaction. A cell adhesive, PEG derivative with hydrophobic oleyl groups at both ends was synthesized and characterized. HepG2 spheroids formed when the adhesive was added to cell suspensions. The size of the spheroids increased with time in culture. In addition, Ammonia elimination of HepG2 spheroid with cell adhesive was 3.4 times higher than that without cell adhesive. Furthermore, albumin secretion from HeG2 spheroids grown with the cell adhesive for 7 days was 3.3 times that from HepG2 spheroids grown without cell adhesive. Fluorescence microscopy showed greater albumin staining in spheroids grown with cell adhesive compared with spheroids grown without adhesive. This cell adhesive may be useful not only for single type of cells but also for multi types of cells to form artificial organs. This cell adhesive will be a key material for liver tissue engineering when it will apply to primary hepatocytes.
