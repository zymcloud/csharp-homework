Altered expressions of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor genes have been reported in tumor cells of human and rats. Recently, we detected the frequent mutations of LPA receptor-1 (LPA1) gene in rat hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) induced by a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet. In this study, the DNA methylation patterns of LPA receptor genes and their expression levels during rat hepatocarcinogenesis induced by the CDAA diet were investigated. Six-week-old F344 male rats were continuously fed with the CDAA diet, and animals were then killed at 7 days and 2, 12, 20, and 75 weeks, respectively. Genomic DNAs were extracted from livers and HCCs for the assessment of methylation status by bisulfite sequencing, comparing to normal livers. The livers of rats fed the CDAA diet were unmethylated in LPA1 and LPA2 genes as well as normal livers. In LPA3 gene, although normal livers were unmethylated, the livers at 7 days and 2 and 12 weeks weakly or moderately methylated and those at 20 weeks markedly methylated. Moreover, 4 HCCs were completely methylated in LPA3 gene. Expression levels of LPA receptor genes in the livers of rats fed the CDAA diet and HCCs were correlating with DNA methylation status. These results indicate that DNA methylation status of the LPA3 gene was disturbed in the livers of rats fed the CDAA diet and established HCCs, suggesting that alterations of the LPA receptor genes might be involved during rat hepatocarcinogenesis induced by the CDAA diet.
