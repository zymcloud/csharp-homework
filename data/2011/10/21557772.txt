Background and aim:A new subset of Treg cells, CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells, has been identified in mice. Herein, we aimed to identify this subset of T cells and to evaluate its function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We detected CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells and its expression of CCR6 and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in peripheral blood of 91 HCC patients, 38 chronic hepatitis patients and 34 healthy donors by flow cytometry. CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells in HCC tissues were also analyzed.Results:CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells were significantly increased in peripheral blood of HCC patients compared with healthy persons and chronic hepatitis patients (8.74% ± 0.42% vs 4.55% ± 0.33% and 5.15% ± 0.36%, P Conclusions:Increased CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells in HCC patients are significantly correlated with tumor size, vascular invasion and TNM stage. Thus, increased CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells exert a critical role in HCC progression and might be a clinically aggressive phenotype of HCC.
