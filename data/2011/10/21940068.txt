Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent cause of mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. There are no prospective series from a single tertiary hospital in Spain.Material and methods:We performed a prospective study of patients with HCC in our center. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics, diagnostic method, staging according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system and treatment were analyzed.Results:A total of 136 patients were included (80.9% men). The mean age was 66.62 Â± 11.68 years and 91.2% were cirrhotic. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was the leading cause of liver disease (38.97%). The suspected diagnosis was established by a surveillance program in 63.2%. Noninvasive American Association criteria for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) were the main diagnostic method (73.5%). According to the BCLC, 58.1% were in the early stage (0-A), 21.3% in stage B, 12.5% in stage C and 8.1% in stage D. Early stage patients had followed a surveillance program more frequently than those with non-early stages (79.75% versus 44.35%, p Conclusions:Most patients with HCC in our hospital have cirrhosis, the most frequent cause being HCV. HCC surveillance in at-risk patients could increase diagnosis of HCC at an early stage. We achieved an early diagnosis in more than half of cases. The most common initial treatment was percutaneous therapy.
