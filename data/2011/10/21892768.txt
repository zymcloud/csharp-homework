Aberrant Notch signaling and Ras pathway had been highlighted a potential role for in human cancers. Yet, relatively little was known about the roles of wild type Notch signaling and Ras in human hepatocarcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of Ras-Notch signaling cooperation in hepatic cells transformation and proliferation. Hepatocellular carcinoma specimens from 25 patients were analyzed for Notch-1, Ras and Late Simian Virus 40 Factor (LSF) expression using immunohistochemistry. Results showed that Notch-1(76%, 19/25, P
