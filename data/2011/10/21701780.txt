The global rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which parallels the increase of hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence, has sparked a renewed interest in discovering additional HCC serum markers. In this study, we investigated the clinical use of serum E-cadherin, ICAM, MMP-2, VEGF, OPN and β-catenin as potential diagnostic makers for HCV/genotype 4-associated HCC. Twenty cases of healthy subjects, 11 cases with asymptomatic HCV/genotype 4 carriers (ASC), 28 chronic hepatitis (CH) cases and 32 patients with HCC were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of proteins were measured by a sandwich-enzyme-linked (ELISA) assay. The diagnostic accuracy of each candidate marker was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, reporting the area under the curve (AUC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). We demonstrated that serum β-catenin levels were significantly elevated in patients with HCC compared to those with CH, ASC and healthy controls. Among the six studied markers, β-catenin was also found to be the only marker that can significantly discriminate between patients with HCC and those with CH; therefore, β-catenin could be considered as a potential marker for early diagnosis of HCV-associated HCC in patients infected with HCV genotype 4.
