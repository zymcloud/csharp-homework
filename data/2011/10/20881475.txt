Objective:To define the safety [dose limiting toxicity (DLT)] and recommended phase II dose of the combination of sorafenib plus gemcitabine and capecitabine for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).Methods:In this phase I dose-escalation study, cohorts of 3 to 6 patients with metastatic RCC received sorafenib (200 or 400 mg po BID), gemcitabine (750 or 1000 mg/m(2) intravenous on days 1 and 8), and capecitabine (415 or 622 mg/m(2) po BID days 1-14) every 21 days using a standard 3+3 design.Results:Fifteen patients with advanced RCC (93% with clear cell histology and 87% treatment naive) received treatment. The recommended phase II doses for the combination were sorafenib 200 mg/m(2) BID continuously plus gemcitabine 750 mg/m(2) intravenous days 1 and 8 and capecitabine 415 mg/m(2) BID days 1 to 14, every 21 days. Of the 15 patients, 3 developed dose-limiting hand-foot syndrome during the first 2 cycles; 2 additional DLT's were grade 3 mucositis and transaminase elevation. Four of 14 evaluable patients had a partial response by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (29%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 8, 58%). Median progression-free survival was 7.5 months (95% CI-0, 18.7), and median overall survival has not been reached at a median follow-up of 28.8 months. The median number of treatment cycles given was 7 (range, 2-38+).Conclusions:The combination of sorafenib plus gemcitabine and capecitabine is tolerable, but requires attenuation of sorafenib and capecitabine dosing because of the overlapping toxicity of hand-foot syndrome. Antitumor activity was observed leading to an ongoing phase II trial.
