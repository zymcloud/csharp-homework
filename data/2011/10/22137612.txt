Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without a contrast agent to visualize the ablative margin after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared with enhanced CT.Methods:Twenty-five HCCs in 19 patients were treated by RFA. T1-weighted MRI was performed before and after RFA, and the signal intensities of the tumors and surrounding liver tissues were measured. Treatment efficacy was assessed based on three grades: margin (+), a continuous high-intensity rim around the index tumor; margin zero, a partially discontinuous high-intensity rim; margin (-), the tumor extends beyond the high-intensity rim.Results:Twelve (86%) of fourteen low-intensity tumors on the pre-MRI were visualized as low-intensity tumors on post-MRI, and the ablative margins were visualized as high-intensity rims. Two (67%) of three high-intensity tumors on pre-MRI were visualized as higher-intensity tumors in the high-intensity ablative margin. Because the signal intensities of tumors and surrounding tissues in 14 tumors that were low- or high-intensity tumors on pre-MRI increased to the same extent, the tumors and ablative margin could be distinguished on post images. In 6 (75%) of the 8 iso-intensity tumors on pre-MRI, the ablative margin and tumor could also not be discriminated on post-MRI. The overall agreement between MRI and CT for the ablative margin was good (Îº coefficient=0.716, p=0.00002).Conclusion:In 82% of low- or high-intensity tumors on pre-MRI, post-MRI without a contrast agent enabled visualization of the ablative margin as a high-intensity rim, and it was possible to evaluate the ablative margin earlier and easier than with enhanced CT.
