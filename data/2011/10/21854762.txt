Objectives:The present study was designed to determine whether aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure has any role to play in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients from northern India.Design and methods:A total of 266 HCC patients and 251 patients of chronic liver disease without-HCC were enrolled into the study. All samples were screened for serological markers for hepatitis B and C infections and levels of AFB1 in food and urine samples.Results:A threefold (OR=3.43) and five-fold (OR=5.47) increased risk of HCC was observed amongst HBV infection and AFB1-levels in food and urine samples, respectively. However, a non-significant risk was observed with respect to HCV infection (OR=1.27) and alcohol consumption (OR=1.18). A threefold (OR=3.15) increased risk of HCC was observed amongst cases of non-viral etiology with respect to urinary AFB1.Conclusion:The data provides an exposure and disease risk information for establishing intervention studies to diminish the impact of aflatoxin exposure in Indian population.
