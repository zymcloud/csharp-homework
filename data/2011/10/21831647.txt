Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of primary hepatic carcinoma. A new N(2)S(2) tetradentate ligand, N-[2-(triphenylmethyl)thioethyl]-3-aza-19-ethyloxycarbonyl-3-[2-(triphenylmethyl)thioethyl]octadecanoate (H(3)MN-16ET), was introduced and labeled with (188)Re to create (188)Re-MN-16ET in the Lipiodol phase. The potential of (188)Re-MN-16ET/Lipiodol for hepatoma therapy was evaluated in a hepatocellular carcinoma animal model of Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with the N1S1 cell line.Methods:Synthesis of H(3)MN-16ET was described, and characterization was identified by infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectra. We compared the effects of transchelating agents (glucoheptonate or tartaric acid) and a reducing agent (stannous chloride) on the complexing of (188)Re-perrhenate and H(3)MN-16ET. Twenty-four rats implanted with hepatoma were injected with 3.7 MBq/0.1 ml of (188)Re-MN-16ET/Lipiodol or (188)Re-MN-16ET via transcatheter arterial embolization. Biodistribution experiments and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging were performed to investigate tumor accumulation.Results:H(3)MN-16ET was proved to easily conjugate with the Re isotope and showed good solubility in Lipiodol. The radiochemical purity of (188)Re-MN-16ET/Lipiodol with 10 mg tartaric acid and stannous chloride was shown to be more than 90%. The major distribution sites of (188)Re-MN-16ET in Sprague-Dawley rats were hepatoma and the liver. However, the radioactivity at the tumor site postadministered with (188)Re-MN-16ET was quickly decreased from 9.15±0.23 (at 1 h) to 2.71%±0.18% of injected dose/g (at 48 h). The biodistribution and micro-single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography image data showed that (188)Re-MN-16ET/Lipiodol was selectively retained at the tumor site, with 11.55±1.44, 13.16±1.46 and 10.67%±0.95% of injected dose/g at 1, 24 and 48 h postinjection, respectively. The radioactivity in normal liver tissue was high but significantly lower than that of the tumors.Conclusion:H(3)MN-16ET is a suitable tetradentate ligand for (188)Re labeling. From the animal data, we suggest that (188)Re-MN-16ET/Lipiodol has the potential to be a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical for hepatoma treatment.
