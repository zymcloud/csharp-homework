Altered cell cycle regulatory genes expression contributes to HCV-associated liver disease. We sought to assess the role of cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) in HCV-associated CH and HCC. Aberrant expression of cyclins A, E, D1, CDK2 and CDK4 was assessed by immunohistochemistry and differential PCR in HCV-associated CH and HCC with pericarcinomatous foci (PCF). S phase fraction (SPF) was determined by flow cytometry. Results were correlated with overall survival (OS) in HCC patients. In HCC, cyclins A, E, D1, CDK2 and CDK4 protein overexpression was detected in 52.8%, 52.8%, 69%, 47% and 58% compared to 36.1%, 33%, 56%, 27.8%, 55.6% for CH and 36.1%, 27%, 30.6%, 27%, 50% for PCF. Gene amplification was detected in 38.9%, 33% 66%, 33%, 44% of HCC compared to 27.8%, 25%, 44%, 27.8%, 36% in CH and 25%, 22.2%, 38.9%, 27%, 33% in PCF. A significant difference was reported between HCC, CH, NHT regarding cyclins A, E, D1, CDK2 (p=0.007, p=0.002, p=0.047, p=0.002) protein expression (ADD) and cyclin D1 amplification (p=0.009). Cyclins A, E, CDK2 expression was associated with fibrosis in CH (p=0.004, p=0.02, p=0.012). Reduced OS was (ADD) associated with cyclin D1 and cyclin A, grade, stage and metastasis (p=0.001, p=0.02, p=0.018, p=0.01, p=0.001).Conclusions:Increased cyclins A, E, D1, CDK2 and CDK4 expression is important for HCV-associated CH and HCC. Cyclin D1 and cyclin A are prognostic biomarkers associated with reduced OS in HCC. Cyclin D1 aberration could identify high risk groups of CH patients prone to develop HCC.
