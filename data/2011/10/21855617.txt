Cell targeted delivery of drugs, including nucleic acids, is known to enhance the therapeutic potential of free drugs. We used serotonin (5-HT) as the targeting ligand to deliver plasmid DNA to cells specifically expressing 5-HT receptor. Our liposomal formulation includes the 5-HT conjugated targeting lipid, a cationic lipid and cholesterol. DNA-binding studies indicate that the targeting 5-HT-lipid binds DNA efficiently. The formulation was tested and found to efficiently deliver DNA into CHO cells stably expressing the human serotonin(1A) receptor (CHO-5-HT(1A)R) compared to control CHO cells. Liposomes without the 5-HT moiety were less efficient in both cell lines. Similar enhancement in transfection efficiency was also observed in human neuroblastoma IMR32 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Cell uptake studies using CHO-5-HT(1A)R cells by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy clearly indicated that the targeting liposomes through 5-HT moiety may have a direct role in increasing the cellular uptake of DNA-lipid complexes. To our knowledge this is the first report that demonstrates receptor-targeted nucleic acid delivery into cells expressing 5-HT receptor.
