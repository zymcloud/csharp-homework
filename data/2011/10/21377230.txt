Purpose:The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of erlotinib (150 mg) is the approved daily dose. In contrast, the approved daily dose of gefitinib (250 mg) is only one-third of its MTD. Significantly different adverse events have been associated with gefitinib and erlotinib.Experimental design:A retrospective investigation examining the adverse events and tolerances of 250 mg daily gefitinib and 150 mg daily erlotinib in Japanese patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was performed. Adverse events were assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. To determine tolerance for each agent, failure was defined as dose reduction or discontinuation of the drug due to adverse events, and early failure as dose reduction or discontinuation due to adverse events before the first evaluation of response.Results:More adverse events including skin disorders, diarrhea, oral mucositis, asthenic conditions, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding were observed in the erlotinib group. Liver function test abnormalities and pneumonitis did not differ between the two groups. Based on multivariate analysis, failure, early failure, and discontinuation due to adverse events were independently associated with erlotinib use.Conclusion:Our data show that 150 mg daily erlotinib was associated with more toxicity and less tolerability than 250 mg daily gefitinib.
