Seven oleanane-type triterpenes and two 8-O-4'-neolignans, along with five known compounds (three 28-noroleanane-type triterpenes, one sarratane triterpene, and one neolignan), were isolated from roots of Nannoglottis carpesioides. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, including 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, and CD. The absolute configurations of two triterpenes were determined by experimental and calculated circular dichroism (CD) and optical rotation values. Ten compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human promyelocytic leukaemia (HL-60) and human hepatoma (Hep-G2) cells using the MTT assay. The antioxidant activities of these compounds were assessed by ABTS radical-scavenging assays. Among the tested compounds, three compounds exhibited moderate radical-scavenging activity against ABTS·⁺, with IC₅₀ values of 22.4, 17.4, and 23.2 μM, respectively.
