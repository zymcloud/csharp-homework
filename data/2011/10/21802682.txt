Background:The role of ERCP in evaluating patients with hepatobiliary dysfunction after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has not been well-defined.Objective:The aim of this study was to better define the role of ERCP after HSCT by reviewing our institutional experience, including indications, findings, and outcomes.Design:Retrospective review of ERCP findings and outcomes in patients after HSCT.Setting:MD Anderson Cancer Center from 1997 to 2009.Patients:A total of 40 patients had ERCP after HSCT during the study period.Intervention:ERCP.Main outcome measurements:Overall survival.Results:A total of 40 patients had ERCP after HSCT during the study period. Seventeen patients had biliary strictures (group 1), and 13 proved to be malignant. Ten patients had common duct stones (group 2). Thirteen patients (group 3) had neither stones nor stricture. Findings in group 3 included bile duct leak (1), dilation without stricture (2), resolution of pretransplant strictures (3), biliary sludge (1), or normal ducts (6). The normal subset proved to have hepatic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (3), hepatic drug toxicity (1), hepatic recurrence of myeloma (1), or pancreatitis with biliary sludge (1). Patients with GI GVHD were equally distributed among the 3 groups. Group 1 had 100% mortality with median time to death being 85 days after ERCP. Group 2 had 30% mortality with median time to death of 584 days after ERCP. Ten of 13 patients in Group 3 died at a median of 148 days after ERCP. The only procedural complication was a mild case of pancreatitis.Limitations:Retrospective study at a single center.Conclusion:One in every 130 post-HSCT patients required ERCP evaluation. Biliary stricture is frequently caused by recurrent or new malignancy, particularly after autologous HSCT. GI GVHD is not associated with biliary stricture. ERCP procedural risks in HSCT patients are acceptable.
