Background:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, large volumes of radiocontrast agents are used for TACE and may induce renal dysfunction. Most patients with HCC have coexisting liver cirrhosis (LC) at the time of diagnosis. Advanced cirrhosis is characterized by peripheral vasodilatation associated with decreased renal perfusion due to the activation of vasoconstrictor systems. We retrospectively investigated patients with HCC who had undergone TACE to determine the incidence and risk factors for radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN).Methods:A total of 101 patients with HCC who underwent a combined 221 TACE treatment sessions were included. Follow-up serum creatinine levels within 96 h after TACE were confirmed in these patients. RCIN was defined as an increase of at least 25% in baseline serum creatinine levels between 48 and 96 h after TACE.Results:RCIN developed in 20 (9%) of the 221 treatment sessions after TACE. A univariate analysis showed that the Child-Pugh score (6.0 ± 1.3 vs. 6.7 ± 1.9, P = 0.005), ascites (14.4 vs. 40%, P = 0.008), contrast medium volume (257.3 ± 66.8 vs. 275.0 ± 44.0 ml, P = 0.009), total bilirubin (1.3 ± 1.7 vs. 3.4 ± 8.0 mg/dl, P Conclusions:RCIN after TACE was closely associated with the severity of LC. Effective preventive measures remain to be determined in patients with HCC and advanced LC who are undergoing TACE.
