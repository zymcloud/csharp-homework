A 68-year-old man presented with a suppurating mass on his skull and a palpable mass on his right upper thoracic wall. Computed tomography revealed a round mass, 70 mm in diameter, invading the right pleural cavity, and a second tumor infiltrating the skull through the left parietal bone. Both masses were resected simultaneously. Histopathology showed that both tumors were hepatocellular carcinomas.
