Hepatic artery chemotherapy with transarterial infusion (TAI) of a cisplatin formulation designed for intra-arterial injection (IA-call®) is recognized as an established treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We experienced three patients whose multiple HCC(Stage III) was successfully treated by TAI using IA-call combined with embolization by porous gelatin particles (Gelpart®), after a series of treatments such as hepatectomy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and TAI. Cisplatin-based TAI was not effective, but porous gelatin particles showed a therapeutic effect in one patient by reducing his hepatic arterial blood flow. The two other patients responded to combination therapy after the second treatment. Adverse events from the treatment were mild. This therapy has benefits even for multiple intra-hepatic lesions that are resistant to TACE and TAI because of its widespread effect on the entire liver, and it could be an effective treatment option for advanced HCC.
