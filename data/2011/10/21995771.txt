We developed a novel coaxial system using a fine guide needle wire (GNW) to safely and easily place the radiofrequency needle under CT-guidance. The GNW consists of a fine needle (diameter, 21-gauge; length, 150 mm) and a wire (0.018 inch, 250 mm). An exclusive radiofrequency cannula (14-gauge; 160 mm) was also used. This system was used for the treatment of six hepatocellular carcinomas in six patients. All lesions were located deeper than 10 cm from the needle entry site. This system was useful in performing CT-guided RF ablation for deeply or precariously located liver lesions particularly in patients who are unable to hold their breath.
