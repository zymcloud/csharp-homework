Objective:To investigate the relationship of alcohol intake and hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with hepatitis B virus infection.Methods:A total of 553 patients with HCC and 160 control subjects affected with hepatitis B virus were recruited. Serum virology, serum biochemistry, as well as demographic information were studied. Finally, risk factors were selected by stepwise Logistic regression analyse. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for each risk factor. According to alcohol intake, HCC patients were divided into three groups,then to observe the differences between them.Results:Elevated AST, GGT, ALP and AFP levels were seen more frequently in the HCC case groups compared to control group (P Conclusions:Heavy alcohol use, smoking, positive family history of liver cancer is positive correlation with HCC development among patients with hepatitis B virus infection in China. In patients with hepatitis B virus infection who also has history of heavy alcohol, the most risk factor of HCC is hepatitis B virus infection, not alcohol.
