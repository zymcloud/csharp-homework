We report a case of primary hepatic actinomycosis showing elevation of serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II). A 68-year-old man visited an affiliated hospital with a complaint of high fever and body weight loss. Hematological examination revealed severe inflammatory reactions and liver dysfunction. Abdominal CT showed a heterogeneous low density area composed of cystic and solid part. We suspected the cystic part with band-like enhancement to be a hepatic abscess and performed percutaneous transhepatic abscess drainage. Although inflammatory reactions decreased after the drainage, the solid part did not shrink and blood chemistry revealed elevation of PIVKA-II. Since we could not rule out the possibility of hepatoma, right hepatectomy was performed. Histological examination revealed actinomycetes. Although primary hepatic actinomycosis is a rare disease, it must be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of the liver tumor.
