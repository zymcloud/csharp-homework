Sorafenib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. By using a population approach, this study aimed to characterise its pharmacokinetics. Plasma concentration-time data (n = 372) from 71 patients under sorafenib were analysed using nonlinear mixed-effect modelling to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters, as well as relationships between these parameters and different covariates (demographic, biological). Simulations were done to compare different daily dosing regimens in a context of dose-escalation. A 1-compartment model with saturated absorption, first-order intestinal loss and elimination best described the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. Absolute bioavailability significantly dropped with increasing daily doses of sorafenib. AUC increased less than proportionally with increasing doses [47.3 (41.3-63.3), 60.3 (56.3-64.4), 71.4 (51.3-99.1), 75.9 (45.5-100.9) mg/L.h for 400, 800, 1,200 and 1,600 mg/day, respectively]. According to the simulations, dividing the daily dose in three or four doses for daily dose >800 mg would significantly increase AUC compared with a twice daily dosing regimen (101.7 vs 81.6 mg/L.h for 400 mg q8h and 600 mg q12h respectively; 131.6 vs 91.5 mg/L.h for 400 mg q6h and 800 mg q12h, respectively). Thrice daily regimen may be most suitable in a context of dose-escalation (>800 mg/day) in non-responders to standard-dosing regimen.
