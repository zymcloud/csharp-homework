We report a 61-year-old male patient who presented with one month history of exertional dyspnea, persistent dry cough, abdominal pain with distension, poor appetite, and weight loss. This case illustrates a rare presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma with mobile right atrial thrombus and pulmonary embolism along with disseminated tumor thrombosis at multiple sites. Furthermore, this case reiterates that an early detection and diagnosis may have increasing importance in the advent of new therapies for treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Disseminated tumor thrombosis; IVC thrombosis; hepatocellular carcinoma; portal vein thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; right atrial thrombus.
