A comprehensive understanding of molecular mechanisms driving cancer onset and progression should provide a basis for improving early diagnosis, biomarker discovery and treatment options. A key value of genetically engineered mice for modeling human cancer is the possibility to analyze the entire process of tumor development. Here, we applied functional genomics approach to study step-by-step development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the c-Myc/Tgfα transgenic mouse model of aggressive human liver cancer. We report that coexpression of c-Myc and Tgfα induces progressive and cumulative transcriptional alterations in the course of liver oncogenesis. Functional analysis of deregulated genes at the early stage of HCC disease supports a model of active hepatocyte proliferation on the background of chronic oxidative stress generated by a general metabolic disorder. In addition, early and persistent deregulation of numerous immune-related genes suggested that disruption of immune microenvironment may contribute to oncogenic process in this model of accelerated liver carcinogenesis. In particularly, by flow cytometry analysis, we found loss of the major histocompatibility complex class I expression in dysplastic hepatocytes followed by upregulation of numerous activating ligands for natural killer (NK) cells concomitant with a drastic decrease in hepatic NK cell frequency. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of sequential molecular changes during a stepwise progression of preneoplastic lesions toward HCC and highlights a critical role of metabolic disorders and innate immunity at the early stages of liver cancer.
