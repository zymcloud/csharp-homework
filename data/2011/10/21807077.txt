Aim:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small non-protein coding RNAs with posttranscriptional regulatory functions as tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Aberrant expression and structural alteration of miRNAs are considered to participate in tumorigenesis and cancer development. It has been suggested that the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) can alter miRNA processing, expression, and/or binding to target mRNA and represent another type of genetic variability that can contribute to the susceptibility of human cancers. A G/C polymorphism (rs2910164), which is located in the sequence of miR-146a precursor, results in a change from G:U to C:U in its stem region.Methods:To determine the association of the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in Turkish population, a hospital-based case-control study was designed consisting of 222 subjects with HCC and 222 cancer-free control subjects matched on age, gender, smoking and alcohol status. The genotype frequency of miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism was determined by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay.Results:No statistically significant differences were found in the allele or genotype distributions of the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism among HCC and cancer-free control subjects (p>0.05).Conclusion:Our results demonstrate that the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism has no major role in genetic susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinogenesis, at least in the population studied here. Independent studies are needed to validate our findings in a larger series, as well as in patients of different ethnic origins.
