Background:Metabolic activity assessed by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglocuse-positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET) reflects biological aggressiveness and prognoses in various tumors. The authors present a correlation between tumor metabolic activity and clinical outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Over a 3-year period (2005-2008), 135 locally advanced HCC patients were treated with localized concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT; external beam radiotherapy at 45 grays for 5 weeks plus concurrent hepatic arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil during the first and fifth week) followed by repetitive hepatic arterial infusional chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. Among them, the authors studied 107 who received (18)F-FDG-PET before CCRT. Maximal standardized uptake values (SUVs) of tumors were calculated.Results:The median maximal tumor SUV was 6.1 (range, 2.4-âˆ¼19.2). Patients with low maximal tumor SUVs (Conclusions:Metabolic activity may be useful not only in predicting prognosis and treatment responses, but also in establishing optimal treatment plans in locally advanced HCC.
