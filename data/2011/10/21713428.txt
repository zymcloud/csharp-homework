Objectives:To investigate the incidence and risk factors of liver-associated morbidity and mortality in Han Chinese patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection.Methods:A retrospective study was conducted.Results:Of the 255 subjects with HIV and HBV coinfection, 181 (71.0%) received lamivudine-based combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Of the patients, 49/255 (19.2%) developed advanced liver diseases (ALDs) (during 5.2 years): 30 patients developed clinically overt cirrhosis, 10 developed hepatocellular carcinoma and 9 developed severe reactivation of a preexisting chronic hepatitis B. Baseline CD4(+) cell count Conclusions:ALDs was common among HIV and HBV coinfected Han Chinese patients. Lamivudine-based cART was beneficial in terms of sustained HBV viral suppression and resulted in less incidence of ALDs.
