Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) of liver metastases from breast cancer and its impact on survival.Materials and methods:Thirteen female patients (age range 36-82 years; median 54.5 years) underwent RFA for the treatment of 21 liver metastases from breast cancer. The procedures were performed under ultrasound (US) guidance using an RF 2000 or RF 3000 generator system and Le Veen monopolar needle electrodes. Follow-up was carried out by computed tomography (CT) after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.Results:Technical success was 100%. No major or minor complications occurred at the end of the procedure. In our series, 7/21 lesions in 7/13 patients increased in size at 7, 18, 19 and 38 months. This resulted in a mean disease-free interval of 16.6 months. Mean overall survival after RFA was 10.9 months.Conclusions:RFA appears to be a useful adjunct to systemic chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy in the locoregional treatment of hepatic metastases from breast cancer. RFA may also be a less invasive alternative to surgery in the locoregional treatment of liver metastases from breast cancer.
