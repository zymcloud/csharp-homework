Objective:Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. has been used for thousands of years in China as a remedy against cancer and inflammatory diseases. This study aims to investigate whether C. orbiculatus extract (COE) could inhibit angiogenesis, which is the pivotal step in tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis.Methods:In this study, the extract from the stem of C. orbiculatus was used. Mouse hepatic carcinoma cells (Hepa1-6) were treated with COE in different nontoxic concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 Î¼g/mL). The mRNA and protein expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively; the active fractions were further tested on C57BL/6 mice and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) for any antiangiogenic effects.Results:COE significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in Hepa1-6 cells and inhibited VEGF expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, this agent inhibited the formation of the capillary-like structure in primary cultured HUVEC in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, COE significantly reduced the volume and weight of solid tumors with low adverse effects and decreased tumor angiogenesis.Conclusions:In summary, COE could be used to treat hepatic carcinoma. The mechanisms of the antitumor activity of COE may be due to its effects against tumor angiogenesis by targeting the VEGF protein.
