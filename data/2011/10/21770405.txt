A new conjugate, octreotide-polyethylene glycol(100) monostearate (OPMS), was developed for the enhancement of targeting delivery of hydroxycamptothecine (HCPT) loaded in nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). 2 × 10(-3) and 5 × 10(-3) mmol of OPMS were respectively used to modify NLC so that the targeted nanocarriers with low and high ligand density were obtained. For comparison, the pegylated NLCs without octreotide were prepared by adding equal molar amounts of polyethylene glycol(100) monostearate (PGMS). The relation between the modification levels and properties of various NLCs were studied in vivo and in vitro. At a high modification level, a slower release rate of HCPT and the more stable nanocarriers was achieved. At the same time, the fixed aqueous layer thickness (FALT) and average surface density of PEG chains (SD(PEG)) was increased, but the distance (D) between two neighboring PEG grafting sites became narrower. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study in healthy rat indicated that the modified NLCs had a longer circulation than NLC (P
