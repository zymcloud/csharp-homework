Purpose:To measure the CD151 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC).Methods:CD151 expression was assessed in 179 CRC patients and 39 patients with hepatic liver metastasis.Results:High CD151 expression was observed in 48% of patients with early-stage CRC versus only 33% of patients with metastatic colon cancer. A higher level of tumor invasion status correlated with a decrease in CD151 expression. Metastatic stage and advanced tumor stage correlated with a decreased CD151 expression. Twenty-seven out of the 39-paired samples had high CD151 expression in liver metastasis sites.Conclusions:CD151 expression is decreased in patients with metastatic CRC.
