We have investigated the changing rule of serum form of GP73 (sGP73) in different hepato-pathologic processes and identified the sGP73 role in inflammation, fibrosis and carcinogenesis since sGP73 has been regarded as a candidate tumor marker. Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detected sGP73 in 535 subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver cirrhosis (LC), hepatitis, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), angioma, intra-hepatic cholangio-carcinoma (ICC) and metastatic cancer from adenocarcinomas (MC). Median sGP73 in LC was higher than in HCC and hepatitis (p = 0.001), and sGP73 in all three groups were higher than those in healthy individuals (p
