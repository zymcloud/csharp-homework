Liver fibrosis has been gaining noticeable attention because it may lead to end-stage liver cirrhosis and ultimately to hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, a precise estimation of the degree of liver fibrosis is crucial for predicting prognosis and deciding management of patients with chronic liver diseases. Many non-invasive approaches for the evaluation of liver fibrosis have been developed. Among these procedures, transient elastography has recently drawn great attention. Transient elastography has been reported to be well correlated with the degree of liver fibrosis by many investigators and various institutions. Since the degree of liver fibrosis is considered as a strong predictor of risk for hepatocellular carcinoma development, several trials have been performed to verify the usefulness of measurement of liver stiffness to predict the emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma. From these studies, transient elastography seems to be a promising procedure to predict the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma; however, further cohorts with long-term monitoring of liver stiffness are needed to confirm the usefulness of this method.
