Background:The human cervical cancer oncogene HCCR-2 is overexpressed in various malignant tumors and cell lines, and might function as a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor. Here, we used RNA interference strategies to evaluate the role of HCCR-2 in liver cancer, and to explore its potential therapeutic effect.Methods:Changes of HepG2 cells stably transfected by an HCCR-2 RNA interference vector were detected by real-time PCR, MTT staining, plate colony formation, flow cytometry, and cell migration experiments. Apoptosis-related protein Bcl-2 and Bax levels were measured by Western blot.Results:Our results showed that of the three siRNA-expressing vectors, siRNA-H3 had a suppressive effect on the expression of HCCR-2 mRNA, interfering with proliferation and migration of HCCR-2. Moreover, the apoptotic rate also increased, and cells transfected by siRNA-H3 were blocked in the G0/G1 stage. Plate colony formation experiments demonstrated that the single cell clone formation capacity of HepG2-H3 cells was clearly lower than that of HepG2 and HepG2-N cells. Western blot results indicated that the expression of Bcl-2 was inhibited, and the expression of Bax was increased.Conclusions:In summary, RNAi targeting HCCR-2 could be an effective means for suppressing malignant features of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
