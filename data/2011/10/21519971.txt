Background:The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) and its effects on tumor angiogenesis and relapse-free survival (RFS) after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Expression of CEACAM1 and CD34 was immunohistochemically detected in HCC specimens from 97 patients. Microvessel density (MVD) was determined by counting CD34-positive endothelial cells. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the effects of CEACAM1 on clinicopathologic factors, tumor angiogenesis, and RFS.Results:CEACAM1 expression was detected in 91 HCC specimens; 53 cases showed membranous expression and 38 cases showed cytoplastic expression. CEACAM1 cytoplastic expression was significantly associated with tumor size, number of tumors, vascular invasion, satellite nodules, Edmondson-Steiner grade, TNM stage, and MVD (p Conclusion:CEACAM1 expression was common in HCC, and CEACAM1 cytoplastic expression was closely associated with tumor progression, angiogenesis, and poorer RFS, indicating that cytoplastic CEACAM1 might be a predictor of relapsing phenotype and a possible novel target of antiangiogenic therapy for patients with HCC.
