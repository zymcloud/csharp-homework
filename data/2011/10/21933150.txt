The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of ARHI (aplasia Ras homologue member I; also known as DIRAS3), a member of the Ras superfamily, on HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) cells and to define the molecular pathways involved. Stable transfection of ARHI into the HCC cell line Hep3B that lacks expression of this gene reduced cell proliferation significantly as compared with the transfection of empty vector (P
