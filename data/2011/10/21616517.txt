p53 plays a pivotal role in apoptosis. In addition, p53 is currently extensively investigated as a promising strategy for highly specific anticancer therapy in chemotherapeutics and photodynamic therapy. However, the role of p53 in the response of tumor cells to sonodynamic therapy treatment is still unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the activation of p53 in sonodynamic therapy. Three murine tumor models with distinct aggressiveness (S180, H-22 and EAC) were treated with 1.75MHz continuous ultrasound at an acoustic intensity (I(SATA)) of 1.4W for 3min in the presence of 20Î¼g/ml hematoporphyrin. The DNA fragment and nuclear damage were observed by TUNEL and single cell gel electrophoresis. Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to analyze the expression of p53, PUMA, Bax and Fas. Then we checked the translocation of p53 by confocal microscopy. DNA sequencing was used to determine the status of p53 gene in three tumor cell lines. Our results indicated that the level of p53 protein and mRNA increased significantly, and p53 activated the expression of its downstream pro-apoptosis gene PUMA, Bax and Fas in the S180 and H-22 cells. Meanwhile, p53 protein translocated onto mitochondria. In the EAC cells, expression and translocation of p53 was not found; the level of PUMA, Bax and Fas remained unaltered. The S180 cells showed most serious DNA fragment and nuclear damage with 77.43% TDNA; H-22 cells in the middle with 58.85% TDNA; whereas EAC cells appeared less nuclear material lost with just 15.82% TDNA. The results of DNA sequencing showed that the sequences of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene of S180, H-22 and EAC cells were the same with the sequences of wild-type p53 provided by NCBI. These results primarily demonstrated that: (1) p53 was activated to promote SDT-induced apoptosis through extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways in the S180 and H-22 cells; (2) cellular responses of different cells to SDT were distinct, the aggressive S180 cells were much more sensitive than H-22, whereas EAC cells were relatively less sensitive. The discrepancy among the cell lines may be due to different activation time of p53 protein.
