The biotransformation of three bioactive bufadienolides, namely, bufotalin (1), telocinobufagin (2), and gamabufotalin (3) by cell suspension cultures of Saussurea involucrata yielded 11 products. Bufotalin yielded 3-epi-bufotalin (1a), 3-epi-desacetylbufotalin (1b), 3-epi-bufotalin 3-O-β-D-glucoside (1c), 1β-hydroxybufotalin (1d), and 5β-hydroxybufotalin (1e); telocinobufagin yielded 3-dehydroscillarenin (2a), 3-dehydrobufalin (2b), and 3-epi-telocinobufagin (2c); and gamabufotalin yielded 3-epi-gamabufotalin (3a), 3-dehydrogamabufotalin (3b), and 3-dehydro-Δ¹-gamabufotalin (3c), respectively. Among these 11 products, 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 3a and 3c are previously unreported. The structures of these metabolites were elucidated based on NMR spectroscopic analyses and mass spectrometry. Most metabolites showed significant cytotoxic activities against human hepatoma (HepG2) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. In addition, the time course for the biotransformation of 3 was investigated.
