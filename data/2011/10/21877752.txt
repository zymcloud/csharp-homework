Most hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is generated from chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. To discover new markers for early HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, we initiated our search in the interstitial fluid of tumor (TIF) via differential gel electrophoresis and antibody arrays and identified secreted ERBB3 isoforms (sERBB3). The performance of serum sERBB3 in diagnosis of HCC was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). The serum sERBB3 level was significantly higher in HCC than in cirrhosis (p
