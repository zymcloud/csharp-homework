Hemangioma is the most common benign tumor of the liver. Unlike cavernous hemangioma, hepatic capillary or mixed capillary-cavernous hemangioma is a rare type of tumor in adults. Clinical presentation of hemangioma may mimic that of hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, radiologic features on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging may not be typical for hemangioma and can be confused with hepatocellular carcinoma. Symptomatic hemangiomas require some form of treatment, such as corticosteroids, interferon, radiation, arterial embolization, surgical resection, or liver transplant. In the present case study, we present a patient treated with liver transplant for hemangioma mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma. This case report illustrates the atypical imaging appearance of hemangioma and possible confusion it can cause in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in a hepatitis C carrier.
