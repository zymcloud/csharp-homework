We report a case of synchronous multiple liver metastases of rectal cancer successfully treated with tegafur/uracil(UFT) and oral Leucovorin (LV) chemotherapy. Lower anterior resection was carried out on the rectal cancer patient (an 80-year- old man), who had synchronous multiple liver metastases. The UFT (450 mg/day) and oral LV (75 mg/day) were orally administered for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week interval after the surgical procedure. After completion of 16 courses, CT scan showed no liver metastases, and the patient was judged to have achieved a complete response (CR). The interval of CR was maintained for sixteen months until the age of 82. This chemotherapy is expected to have a potent therapeutic efficacy for older adult patients with advanced rectal cancer, because it is convenient and causes no severe diverse events.
