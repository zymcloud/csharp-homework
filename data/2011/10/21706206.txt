Background:Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) is used as a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is influenced by hepatitis. Protein-induced vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II) is a sensitive diagnostic marker. Changes in these markers after treatment may reflect curability and predict outcome.Methods:We conducted an analysis of prognosis in 470 HCC patients who received curative treatments, and examined the relationship between changes in AFP and PIVKA-II levels after 1 month of treatment in 156 patients. Subjects were divided into three groups according to changes in both levels: (1) normal (L) group before treatment, (2) normalization (N) or (3) decreased but still above normal level or unchanged (ANU) group after treatment.Results:High AFP and PIVKA-II levels were significantly associated with poor tumor-free and overall survival. The presence of large size and advanced stage were significantly associated with prevalence of DU group. Overall survival in the AFP-L group was significantly better than that of other groups and overall survival in PIVKA-II-L and N groups were significantly better than that of the PIVKA-II-ANU groups. The combination of changes in the AFP- ANU and PIVKA-II- ANU groups showed the worst tumor-free and overall survivals. Multivariate analysis identified high pre-treatment levels of AFP and PIVKA-II and combination of AFP- ANU and PIVKA-II- ANU as significant determinants of poor tumor-free and overall survival, particularly in patients who underwent hepatectomy.Conclusion:We conclude that high levels of AFP or PIVKA-II after treatment for HCC did not sufficiently reflect curative efficacy of treatment and reflected a poor predictor of prognosis in HCC patients.
