Background & aims:It is not clear whether risk for hepatocellular carcinoma can be accurately determined from long-term changes in serum levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA or alanine aminotransferase (ALT).Methods:We measured serum levels of HBV DNA and ALT at enrollment and during follow-up analysis of 3160 participants in the REVEAL-HBV study. Development of hepatocellular carcinoma was determined from follow-up examinations and computerized linkage with National Cancer Registry and National Death Certification profiles. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression models.Results:During 38,330 person-years of follow-up, 81 participants developed hepatocellular carcinoma (incidence rate, 211.3/100,000 person-years). The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma was only slightly higher for participants whose follow-up levels of HBV DNA spontaneously decreased to Conclusions:Long-term changes in serum levels of HBV DNA and ALT are independent predictors of risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Regular monitoring of levels of HBV DNA and ALT is important in clinical management of chronic carriers of HBV.
