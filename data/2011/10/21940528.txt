Objective:This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the caudate lobe, where RFA is considered to be difficult.Materials and methods:Of a total of 810 patients treated by ultrasound-guided radiotherapy between July 2002 and May 2010, medical records of 50 consecutive patients with HCC in the caudate lobe were reviewed in this retrospective study. Twenty-two tumors were found to be in the paracaval portion and 28 in the Spiegel lobe. We retrospectively reviewed the procedures, treatment effect, and complications.Results:For all paracaval tumors and eight Spiegel lobe tumors, we used the intercostal approach, and for the remaining Spiegel tumors (n = 20) we used the pass-the-left approach. We found that all tumors were successfully treated, and the local recurrence rate after 2 years was 12%. Cases of mortality or major complications after RFA were absent.Conclusion:RFA appears to be an effective treatment modality for HCC in the caudate lobe.
