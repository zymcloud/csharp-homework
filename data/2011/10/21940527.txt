Objective:The purpose of our study was to evaluate hepatic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac toxicity after PRECISION transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads (DEB) versus conventional TACE with doxorubicin in the treatment of intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Subjects and methods:Two hundred twelve patients (185 men and 27 women; mean age, 67 years) were randomized to TACE with DEB or conventional TACE. The majority of patients (67% in both groups) presented in a more advanced stage. Safety was measured by rate of adverse events (Southwest Oncology Group criteria) and changes in laboratory parameters. Cardiotoxicity was assessed with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) mainly on MRI or echocardiography.Results:The mean maximum postchemoembolization alanine transaminase increase in the DEB group was 50% less than in the conventional TACE group (p Conclusion:PRECISION TACE with DEB loaded with doxorubicin offers a safe therapy option for intermediate-stage HCC, even in patients with more advanced liver disease.
