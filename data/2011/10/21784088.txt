The chemo-resistance character of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells is well known but the anomalies associated with such resistance character are not completely understood. In this study, etoposide-induced signaling events in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, Hep G2 has been compared with Chang Liver cells, a normal human liver cell line. Hep G2 cells are resistant to etoposide when compared with Chang Liver cells. Etoposide-induced Î³H2AX foci in Hep G2 cells are persisted for a longer time without affecting cell cycle, indicating that Hep G2 cells are able to maintain its growth with damaged DNA. Further, Akt signaling pathway is deregulated in Hep G2 cells. The upstream negative regulator of Akt, PTEN remains inactive, as it is hyperphosphorylated in Hep G2 cells. Inhibition of PI-3K pathway by wortmannin partially reverses the etoposide-resistance character of Hep G2 cells. Either Hep G2 or Chang Liver cells when transfected with plasmid carrying active Akt (myr-Akt) become resistance towards etoposide compared to the cells transfected with empty vectors or kinase defective Akt. Transient transfection of wild type PTEN in Hep G2 cells does not change its response towards etoposide whereas Chang Liver cells become sensitive after transfection with same plasmid. These results suggest that inactivation of PTEN, which renders activation of Akt, may contribute largely for the etoposide-resistance character of Hep G2 cells.
