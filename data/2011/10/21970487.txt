Context:Knowledge of the etiology and pathogenesis of chronic viral hepatitis has grown immensely during the past 50 years. The terminology used to assess liver biopsies with chronic viral hepatitis and the role of the liver biopsy itself have also evolved during this time. Although the focus of much discussion regarding diagnostic assessment of liver biopsies in patients with viral hepatitis has been on grading of activity and staging of fibrosis, each biopsy is also an opportunity to assess many other important features.Objectives:To discuss opportunities provided by biopsies to assess features such as the presence of virus-associated premalignant or malignancy-related changes, and the presence of other concomitant diseases, including fatty liver disease of diverse causes, and hemochromatosis, hereditary or otherwise.Data sources:The data were obtained from published literature and professional experience.Conclusions:The evaluation of liver biopsies with chronic viral hepatitis has evolved beyond grading and staging. Pathologists need to be aware of the other features that may have important clinical implications.
