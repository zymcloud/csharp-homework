Aim:To investigate the value of liver stiffness in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with viral hepatitis, and to prospectively investigate relationships between liver stiffness and HCC development.Methods:Liver stiffness was measured by transient elastography for 157 patients with viral hepatitis, along with various other parameters potentially associated with HCC. HCC was initially present in 41 patients and absent in 116 patients, of whom 106 patients were followed prospectively for HCC development. Diagnostic performances of liver stiffness and other clinical parameters in predicting presence of HCC were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curve (AUROC).Results:Liver stiffness was significantly higher in patients with HCC (24.9 ± 19.5 kPa) than in patients without HCC (10.9 ± 8.4 kPa; P Conclusions:Liver stiffness as measured by transient elastography is a predictor of HCC development in viral hepatitis.
