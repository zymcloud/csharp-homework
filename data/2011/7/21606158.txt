Glycosylation, which regulates the configuration and function of glycoproteins, is the most important post-translational modification. The aim of this study was to observe the differential patterns in glycan and protein parts of the serum haptoglobin-β subunit (Hp-β) purified from patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, liver cirrhosis (LC), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 2-D gel electrophoresis and multiplexed proteomics staining technique were employed to investigate whether the Hp-β glycan level was proportional to the protein level. Multi-lectin blot, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and western blot analysis were carried out to identify the glycoform of Hp-β quantitatively. Our experiments showed that the ratio of total serum Hp-β to the glycosylated form of Hp-β varied among the patients with different liver diseases. The total Hp-β protein expression level was much higher in HCC than LC, while an incremental proportion of fucosylated Hp-β was also observed in LC and HCC patients compared with that in HBV and healthy controls. Differential fucosylation was further identified as a Lewis X structure by HPLC and anti-human Sialyl-Lewis X antibody. In conclusion, the aberrant alternation of Hp-β glycan and total protein expression may be a promising biomarker for early hepatocarcinogenesis.
