A new triterpene saponin, androsacin (1), along with two known compounds, ardisiacrispin A (2) and saxifragifolin A (3), were isolated from the whole plants of Androsace integra. The chemical structure of the new compound was elucidated as 3β-O-{β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→2)-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-[O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)]-α-L-arabinopyranosyl}-16α-hydroxy-13β,28-epoxy-olean-30-al on the basis of spectral evidence. Ardisiacrispin A (2) was cytotoxic toward HepG2 cancer cell with the GI(50) value of 1.56μM.
