Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and microRNAs have been implicated to influence this process. Emerging evidence indicates that miR-198 is down-regulated in HCC compared to normal liver parenchyma, but the functional roles of miR-198 in HCC cells remains unexplored. Herein, we show that miR-198 directly targets c-MET via its 3'UTR. Forced expression of miR-198 decreased c-MET expression at both mRNA and protein levels and consequently diminished HGF induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK in HCC cells. Forced expression of miR-198 inhibited HGF promotion of HCC cell migration and invasion in a c-MET dependent manner. In conclusion, we have identified miR-198 as a novel suppressor of HCC cell invasion by negative regulation of the HGF/c-MET pathway.
