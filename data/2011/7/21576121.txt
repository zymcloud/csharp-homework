Data from the Texas prison system and the Texas Vital Statistics Bureau were used to identify and assess the leading medical causes of death from 1992 to 2003 among male prisoners in Texas (N = 4,026). The leading medical causes of death were infection, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), liver disease, and respiratory disease. Of these, only cancer showed a significant average annual increase in crude death rates (2.5% [0.2% to 4.9%]). Among prisoners aged 55 to 84 years, crude average annual death rates due to cancer and CVD were high and substantially exceeded death rates due to other causes. Among prisoners aged 25 to 44 years, crude average annual death rates due to infection exceeded death rates due to other causes. Continued improvements in the prevention, screening, and treatment of these conditions are warranted in correctional health care settings.
