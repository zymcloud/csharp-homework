Choriocarcinoma is the most malignant tumor of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. It grows rapidly and metastasizes to the lung, liver, and less frequently, the brain. Metastases to the kidney are rare in the literature, and bilateral involvement is even more scarce. Renal involvement of choriocarcinoma is highly exceptional and may mimic renal cell carcinoma. Here we report a case of bilateral renal choriocarcinoma presenting 5 years after a history of a total anterior hysterectomy because of a hydatidiform mole.
