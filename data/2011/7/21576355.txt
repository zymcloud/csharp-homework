Squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1) is a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family of proteins, whose target proteases include the cathepsins. Initially identified as a serological marker for advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix, SCCA1 has also been found to be associated with other cancer types of epithelial or endodermal origins such as lung cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. While the biological function of SCCA1 remains largely unclear, it is believed to limit cellular damage resulting from lysosomal cathepsin release. Here, we show that SCCA1 acts as a molecular switch that inhibits cell death induced by lysosomal injury resulting from DNA alkylating agents and hypotonic shock, whereas it promotes a caspase-8-mediated apoptosis in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In response to ER stress, SCCA1 blocks both lysosomal and proteasomal protein degradation pathways and enhances the interaction between sequestosome 1/p62 and caspase-8, which leads to the aggregation of intracellular caspase-8 and its subsequent cleavage and activation. Hence, on one hand, SCCA1 inhibits cell death induced by lysosomal injury while, on the other hand, it sensitizes cells to ER stress by activating caspase-8 independently of the death receptor apoptotic pathway.
