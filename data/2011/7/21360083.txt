Background:The value of the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been evaluated in detail.Methods:Between 2008 and 2009, 61 patients with HCC within the Milan criteria underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and hepatectomy. The tumor margin was determined preoperatively based on hepatobiliary phase images. Microscopic portal vein invasion (MPVI), intrahepatic metastasis (IM), and recurrence of HCC within 1 year after hepatectomy were evaluated in 24 patients with non-smooth margins at the periphery of the tumor and 37 patients with smooth margins.Results:The number of patients with MPVI and IM of HCC was significantly higher among those with non-smooth margins (42 and 38%, respectively) than among those with smooth margins (3%; p = 0.0002 and 5%; p = 0.0042, respectively). A non-smooth margin was identified as a significant predictor of MPVI (odds ratio 18.814, p = 0.024) and IM (odds ratio 6.498, p = 0.036) of HCC on multivariate analysis. Furthermore, a non-smooth margin was identified as a significant predictor of recurrence within 1 year after hepatectomy (odds ratio 4.306, p = 0.04) on multivariate analysis.Conclusions:A non-smooth tumor margin in the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI is useful to predict MPVI, IM, and early recurrence of HCC after hepatectomy.
