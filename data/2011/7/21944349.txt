Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a challenging malignancy as a result of the advanced course at presentation. Recent interventional advances have improved treatment of lesions unamenable to resection using drug-eluting microbeads delivered into the hepatic circulation. We hypothesize that the use of hepatic arterial therapy (HAT) will safely identify appropriate patients who can proceed to ablation and/or transplantation. We evaluated our open-label, multicenter, multinational, single-arm study including 240 patients with intermediate-staged HCC who received drug-eluting beads and were not initial candidates for transplantation or resection. We reviewed the resulting clinical data to determine factors leading to possible ablation or transplant. Of 240 patients undergoing HAT, 14 (5.8%) received ablation or transplant. We compared those receiving ablation or transplant with those receiving only HAT. Groups were similar regarding sex, age, median number of tumors (one; range, 1 to 25), Child's score, tobacco and alcohol abuse, and treatment type. Patients who were downstaged were more likely to have: hepatitis-related tumors (76 to 66%, P = 0.02), distinct lesions on imaging (92 to 76%, P = 0.004), and less than 25 per cent parenchymal involvement (84 to 59%, P = 0.0001). These patients typically had one tumor frequently in the left lobe (58.8 vs 30.9%, P = 0.0001), accessible through segmental arteries (47 vs 17%, P = 0.001), with increased segmental branch occlusion (57 vs 39%, P = 0.02). HAT should be considered a potential bridging therapy to eventual ablation or transplant in the multimodal treatment of HCC.
