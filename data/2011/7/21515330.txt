Apigenin (APG) has been shown to have a strong anti-cancer effect on various cancer models via a programmed cell death, apoptosis. However, the fundamental mechanisms of these effects are still unclear. In the present study, we examined the question of whether or not APG can inhibit proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), huh-7 cells, resulting in apoptosis. In APG-treated cells, we observed typical features of apoptosis. To identify the proteins related to APG-induced apoptosis, we performed two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis and identified differentially expressed proteins. Among these proteins, we focused on vimentin, which plays a physiological role, such as cell migration and adhesion. We validated expression of vimentin in both mRNA and protein levels, verifying its decrease. In addition, we observed that APG down-regulated the expression levels of type I collagen, which collaborated with vimentin in cell migration and decreased the releasing amounts of VEGF and MMP-8, which are closely relevant to angiogenic activity. Finally, we confirmed the decreased capacity of cell migration due to down-regulation of vimentin, type I collagen, VEGF, and MMP-8 induced by APG. Based on the overall results, we suggested that vimentin was potentially associated with APG-induced apoptosis, as a key regulator in angiogenesis and migration.
