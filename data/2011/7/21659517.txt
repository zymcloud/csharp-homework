Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is inherently resistant to the majority of clinical anticancer drugs. To obtain drugs that can circumvent or evade such inherent drug resistance of HCC, we investigated the effect of the marinely derived steroid methyl spongoate (MESP) on HCC cells. MESP displayed potent cell killing against a panel of six HCC cell lines, independent of their expression of drug transporters. MESP did not change the function of the drug transporters, and its cell killing was not impaired in multidrug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing the transporters. The cell killing of MESP was irrelevant to estrogen or androgen signaling and was not associated with cell cycle progression, inhibition of microtubules, and topoisomerases. In contrast, MESP potently induced apoptosis via activation of a proapoptotic caspase cascade and relief of the suppression of antiapoptotic signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. MESP inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3, a critical survival signaling factor that reduced the expression of the antiapoptotic protein x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein but enhanced the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax, thus promoting caspase-dependent apoptosis. These data reveal that MESP may well serve as an important candidate drug lead for HCC therapy.
