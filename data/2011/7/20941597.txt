Purpose:The survival of patients with liver metastases from solid tumors is poor. We conducted a phase I study of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) paclitaxel in patients with advanced cancer and predominant liver involvement.Methods:Patients were treated with HAI paclitaxel 150-275 mg/m(2) (and 15,000 IU heparin intraarterially) every 28 days. A "3 + 3" study design was used.Results:Twenty-six patients were treated (median age, 59 years). Diagnoses were colorectal cancer (n = 10), breast cancer (n = 7), and other (n = 9). The median number of prior therapies was four (range, 0-10). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was HAI paclitaxel 225 mg/m(2). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) included Grade 3 neuropathy (1 of 5 patients) at HAI paclitaxel 275 mg/m(2) and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, and Grade 3 mucositis (1 of 4 patients) at 250 mg/m(2). None of the eight patients treated with HAI paclitaxel 225 mg/m(2) experienced a DLT. The most common toxicities were nausea and peripheral neuropathy. Of 22 patients evaluable for response, 3 (13.6%) patients had SD for â‰¥4 months (colorectal cancer, n = 1; thyroid cancer, n = 1; and hepatocellular carcinoma, n = 1; duration of response was 4 months, 7.1 months, and 22.2+ months, respectively).Conclusion:The MTD of HAI paclitaxel was 225 mg/m(2). This regimen was well tolerated and had antitumor activity in selected patients.
