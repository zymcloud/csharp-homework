Aims:Overweight/obesity is currently a common health issue that may cause many diseases, even malignancies. The influence of steatosis on long-term results of surgical treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well known. The aim of this study is to analyze the results of hepatectomy for HCC patients with steatosis.Methods:The study included 1048 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC from 1999 to 2005. The patients were divided into two groups; group A patients without steatosis (n = 693) and group B patients with steatosis (n = 355). The clinicopathological data and long-term survival were analyzed.Results:Mean tumor size in group B patients was smaller than that in group A patients (4.61 ± 3.40 vs. 5.91 ± 4.36 cm, p 5 cm in diameter, group B patients had better survival rate than group A patients (p = 0.041). Vascular invasion and steatosis were independent prognostic factors for the overall survival.Conclusion:HCC in steatotic liver was less aggressive than that in non-steatotic liver. HCC patients with steatosis have better surgical outcomes than those without steatosis. Vascular invasion and steatosis were independent prognostic factors for the overall survival if tumors were >5 cm in diameter.
