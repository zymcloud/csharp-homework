Aim:The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinicopathological features and the efficacy of endoscopic treatments in treating gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) in association with liver diseases.Methods:Thirty-four patients with the characteristic endoscopic findings of GAVE were enrolled. Endoscopic treatments were carried out for all 34 patients, including argon plasma coagulation (APC) in 22 patients and endoscopic band ligation (EBL) in 12 patients.Results:All 34 patients had iron-deficiency anemia and 21 patients also had a history of tarry stools. The underlying pathologies of chronic liver diseases were liver cirrhosis in 26 patients, liver cirrhosis associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in six, and idiopathic portal hypertension in two. The liver function was classified by Child-Pugh classification: class A (n=6), class B (n=21), and class C (n=7). Antral motility was frequent and intense in all 34 GAVE patients. In the 22 patients who received APC, endoscopies revealed the recurrence of GAVE in 15 patients requiring further treatment by APC (recurrence rate, 68.2%). Seven patients died during the follow-up period, including two cases with bleeding-related deaths. In the 12 patients who received EBL, endoscopies revealed the recurrence of GAVE in one patient requiring further treatment by EBL (recurrence rate, 8.3%). Two patients died during the follow-up period, neither were bleeding-related deaths.Conclusions:The results suggest that GAVE is related to severe liver damage and portal hypertension. APC has a high recurrence rate of GAVE in the medium term after treatment. EBL may be useful as a treatment for GAVE.
