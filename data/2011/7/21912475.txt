Aim:To investigate the association between GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese population.Methods:Literature databases including PubMed, ISI web of science and other databases were searched. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated using random- or fixed- effects model. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were also performed.Results:Nineteen studies of GSTM1 (2660 cases and 4017 controls) and 16 studies of GSTT1 (2410 cases and 3669 controls) were included. The GSTM1/GSTT1 null genotypes were associated with increased risk of HCC in Chinese population (for GSTM1, OR = 1.487, 95% CI: 1.159 to 1.908, P = 0.002; for GSTT1, OR = 1.510, 95% CI: 1.236 to 1.845, P = 0.000). No publication bias was detected. In subgroup analysis, glutathione S-transferases polymorphisms were significantly associated with HCC risk among the subjects living in high-incidence areas, but not among the subjects living in low-incidence areas.Conclusion:The present meta-analysis suggests that GSTM1/GSTT1 null genotypes are associated with increased risk of HCC in Chinese population.
