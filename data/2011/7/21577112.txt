Purpose of review:Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare disease of children, adolescents and young adults, which begins in the abdominal cavity. Less than 200 cases are reported in the world literature. Because of the rarity of this disease, little is known about optimal treatment. Patients may present with dozens to hundreds of tumors studding the peritoneal cavity. Despite this presentation, it is not primarily considered metastatic but multifocal. It can metastasize to the liver or lung. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical approaches have not been standardized. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy often yields a partial response; however, tumors may remain surgically un-resectable. An aggressive approach to treatment is required to maximize long-term remission. This review is designed to outline the evidence-based multidisciplinary approach to DSRCT.Recent findings:Complete surgical resection, including 1-2 mm implants, is necessary to achieve long-term disease control. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy using cisplatin has recently been found to be a low morbidity treatment option for DSRCT patients. Yttrium microspheres have been used successfully to treat liver metastasis from DSRCT.Summary:DSRCT is a rare tumor that requires a multidisciplinary approach which includes aggressive surgical extirpation to provide long-term disease control.
