Molecular biomarker has been proposed to improve patient selection and post-transplant prognostication, but rare achievement has been made. In the present study, Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) expression and its prognostic role have been investigated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We found that the notably higher level of FOXM1 in tumors was associated with malignant pathological features of HCC and unfavorable outcome after OLT. The status of FOXM1 expression combined with the Milan criteria could make the prognostication more accurate and may be of particular interest for expanding the criteria in selecting transplant candidates.
