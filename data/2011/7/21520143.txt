Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is the major protein component of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in serum, and participates in the reverse transport of cholesterol from tissues to the liver for excretion. The natural HDL tropism to the liver and cancer cells has been used extensively to target encapsulated drugs. The alteration of the plasmatic isoforms of ApoA-I is a hallmark of chronic hepatitis and hepatocarcinoma in mice and humans. Woodchucks infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) represent the best animal model for the study of chronic viral hepatitis B and viral induced hepatocarcinoma (HCC). WHV-infected woodchuck represents a clinically relevant animal model under which new treatment strategies can be evaluated and optimized. Therapeutic efficacy in this model is likely to be translated into a successful therapy for patients infected with HBV. The present study describes, for the first time, the cloning and characterization of woodchuck ApoA-I. The open reading frame (ORF) of the woodchuck ApoA-I is 795 bp long, coding for 264 amino acids. Unexpectedly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the closest sequences are those of human and macaque. Woodchuck HDLs were isolated successfully from sera by density gradient ultracentrifugation. A commercial antibody that recognized the woodchuck ApoA-I was also identified. Finally, taking advantage of the techniques and tools developed in this study, two potential applications of woodchuck HDLs are illustrated: drug delivery to a woodchuck hepatocarcinoma cell line and the use of isoelectrofocusing to identify ApoA-I isoforms.
