Background:The appropriate treatment strategy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that does not meet the Milan criteria (MC) is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the significance of surgical treatment for such patients.Study design:From January 1990 to December 2007, 151 patients with HCC exceeding MC who underwent curative surgical treatment were enrolled. Survival and recurrence data and clinicopathological factors were examined. Prognostic factors were analyzed to identify those that contributed to improved surgical outcomes retrospectively.Results:After the initial hepatectomy, the overall 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 73%, 55%, and 33%, respectively, for the 151 patients in this study; the corresponding disease-free survival rates were 36%, 30%, and 17%, respectively. A platelet count under 10(5)/mm(3), multiple tumors, and liver cirrhosis of noncancerous tissue were adverse survival and disease-free survival factors by univariate analysis. Platelet count was an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis. The 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates of HCC exceeding MC in patients whose platelet count was 10(5)/mm(3) or greater reached 76%, 65%, and 44%, respectively, and were comparable with those that met MC (86%, 68%, and 37%, respectively).Conclusions:Hepatectomy for patients with advanced HCC exceeding MC improves survival, especially for patients with a sufficiently high platelet count, although recurrence rates after initial hepatectomy are high.
