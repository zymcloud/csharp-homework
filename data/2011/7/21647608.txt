We present a patient with iron overload, who was initially diagnosed with hereditary haemochromatosis. Family analysis, however, established that the iron overload was secondary to congenital sideroblastic anaemia. The patient died of a hepatocellular carcinoma, likely a complication of iron overload, despite phlebotomies. Increased awareness, as well as development of evidence-based clinical guidelines, is required for timely diagnosis and adequate treatment.
