Objective:To recombinant express hepatoma associated gene(HTA) and pre-test the function of HTA to determine the role of HTA in the development of liver cancer.Methods:HTA338-616 was amplified from HepG2 cells and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET21a(+)-MBP. The proteins MBP and MBP-HTA were induced, purified by His-tag magnetic bead purification kit and identified by Western blot and ELISA. HepG2 cells were stimulated with MBP or MBP-HTA proteins. MTT assay and colony formation assay were employed to examine the proliferation of these cells and the changes of cell cycle distribution were determined by flow cytometry.Results:The prokaryotic expression plasmid pET21a(+)-MBP-HTA was successfully constructed. We got a 52 kD purified purpose protein.The proliferation of HepG2 cells stimulated with MBP-HTA was significantly higher than those stimulated with MBP and negative controls. HepG2 cells stimulated with MBP-HTA showed significant decrease fraction in G1 phase and increase fraction in S phase, and the cell proliferation was enhanced.Conclusion:HTA protein can significantly promote the proliferation of HepG2 cells, which may be related to the promotion of G1 phase to S phase.
