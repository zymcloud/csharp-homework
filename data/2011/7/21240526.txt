Purpose:For decades of years, hundreds of candidate gene-based association studies explored the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There was no systematic review summarized the results of these association studies of candidate SNPs and HCC to date. In order to summarize the results of the association studies, we conducted a concise systematic review.Methods:By searching Pubmed database before October 2010, we reviewed all the association studies about candidate SNPs and HCC. If the eligible study number on a given SNP was more than three, we conducted a meta-analysis. We reported here only the overall positive-association results with statistical significance and evaluated the reliability of the associations by using false-positive report probability (FPRP) analysis and the Venice guidelines on genetic epidemiology studies.Results:Six SNPs of five genes (rs1800562 of HFE, rs17868323 and rs11692021 of UGT1A7, rs2279744 of MDM2, rs1143627 of IL-1B, and rs4880 of MnSOD) showed overall significant associations with HCC. The eligible number of the studies varied from three to nine. Two SNPs (rs1800562 of HFE and rs2279744 of MDM2) passed the FPRP threshold (FPRP Conclusions:Two SNPs (rs1800562 of HFE and rs2279744 of MDM2) were associated with HCC with moderate epidemiological evidence and deserve further study and additional biological and clinical assessment.
