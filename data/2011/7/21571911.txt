Because liver involvement in patients with metastatic cancer has limited options and poor outcomes, we conducted a phase I study to determine the safety, activity, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of hepatic arterial infusion of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (HAI nab-paclitaxel). Cohorts of three patients having predominant hepatic metastases received HAI nab-paclitaxel at three dose levels (180, 220, and 260 mg/m(2), respectively) infused for more than 1 hour every 3 weeks (3 + 3 design). Some patients participated in comparative pharmacokinetic studies (i.v. vs. HAI), receiving their first course i.v., to determine peak concentrations and effect of first-pass hepatic extraction compared with subsequent courses administered by HAI. The highest dose level was expanded to determine the safety and activity of HAI nab-paclitaxel. Thirty-eight patients were treated. There were no dose-limiting toxicities at doses up to 260 mg/m(2). Common adverse events included alopecia, fatigue, myelosuppresion, nausea, and vomiting. Three patients had stable disease for 4 or more months and 2 patients (1 of 12 with breast cancer and 1 of 1 with cervical cancer) achieved a partial response lasting for 5 and 15 months, respectively. Peak concentrations were lower (∼50%) with greater hepatic extraction of drug (∼42%) following HAI than i.v. infusion based on area under the curve comparison of drug exposure. HAI nab-paclitaxel showed partial hepatic extraction. At doses 260 mg/m(2) or less given for 1 hour every 3 weeks, the treatment was well-tolerated and showed activity in advanced cancer patients with predominant liver metastases.
