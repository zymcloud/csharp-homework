Rationale and objectives:To prospectively test the hypothesis that transcatheter intraarterial perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (TRIP-MRI) measured semiquantitative perfusion reductions during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are associated with tumor response.Materials and methods:Twenty-eight patients (mean age 63 years; range 47-87 years) with 29 tumors underwent chemoembolization in a combined magnetic resonance interventional radiology suite. Intraprocedural tumor perfusion reductions during chemoembolization were monitored using TRIP-MRI. Pre- and postchemoembolization semiquantitative area under the time-signal enhancement curve (AUC) tumor perfusion was measured. Mean tumor perfusion pre- and postchemoembolization were compared using a paired t-test. Imaging follow-up was performed 1-3 months after chemoembolization. We studied the relationship between short-term tumor imaging response and intraprocedural perfusion reductions using univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:Intraprocedural AUC perfusion value decreased significantly after chemoembolization (342.1 vs. 158.6 arbitrary unit, P Conclusion:TRIP-MRI can successfully measure semiquantitative changes in HCC perfusion during chemoembolization. Intraprocedural tumor perfusion reductions are associated with future tumor response.
