Purpose:To elucidate the natural history of hypovascular nodules that appear hypointense on hepatocyte-phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images by focusing on hypervascularization over time.Materials and methods:In this study, 135 hypovascular nodules revealing no gadoxetic acid uptake in 53 patients were examined. All nodules were retrospectively examined using serial follow-up computed tomography (CT) and MRI examinations until hypervascularity was observed on arterial-phase dynamic CT or gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images, or on CT during hepatic arteriography. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between hypervascularization and MR findings including a presence of fat assessed by a signal drop on opposed-phase T1-weighted images.Results:Of the 135 nodules, 16 underwent hypervascularization. The size of the nodules and the presence of fat in the nodules were independent indicators of hypervascularization. The 1-year cumulative risk of hypervascularization was 15.6%. This risk was significantly increased in the case of nodules >10 mm (37.6%, P Conclusion:Hypovascular nodules that appear hypointense on hepatocyte-phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images may progress to conventional hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma. Nodules more than 10 mm in diameter and containing fat are at high risk for developing hypervascularization.
