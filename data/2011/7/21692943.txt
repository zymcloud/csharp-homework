Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with chronic inflammation of liver, which leads to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of severe side effects and only a 50-70% cure rate in genotype 1 HCV-infected patients upon current standard treatment with pegylated interferon-α plus ribavirin, new therapeutic regimens are still needed. San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang (SHXT) is a transitional Chinese herbal formula, composed of Rhei rhizoma, Scutellaria radix and Coptidis rhizome, and possesses anti-inflammatory effect. Here, we describe a (+)-catechin-containing fraction extracted from SHXT, referred as SHXT-frC, exhibited effective inhibition of HCV replication, with selectivity index value (SI; CC50 /EC50) of 84, and displayed synergistic anti-HCV effects when combined with interferon-α, HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir or polymerase inhibitor 2'-C-methylcytidine. The activation of factor-κB (NF-κB) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) signalling pathway has particular relevance to HCV-associated HCC. SHXT-frC treatment also caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the induction of COX-2 and NF-κB expression caused by either HCV replication or HCV NS5A protein. Collectively, SHXT-frC could be an adjuvant treatment for patients with HCV-induced liver diseases.
