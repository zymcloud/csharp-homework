To evaluate the therapeutic effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (UHCC), we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching the database. In nine controlled trials with a total of 736 patients, the effect of TACE plus HIFU (group A) was compared with TACE alone (group B) in treating UHCC. Outcomes mainly included tumor response and survival. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each relationship from raw study data using the fixed-effect model or the random effect model. We found that group A significantly improved the tumor response and 0.5-, 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival of patients. In conclusion, combined therapy was more therapeutically beneficial. However, considering the strength of the evidence, additional randomized controlled trials are needed before combined therapy can be recommended routinely.
