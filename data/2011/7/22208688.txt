Objective:Liver transplantation (LT) is known to be a promising treatment for patients with liver cirrhosis associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study, however, found that HCC recurrence remains to be a concern.Methods:A total of 126 HCC patients who had undergone LT between January 2000 and December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinicopathological features of the patients were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses to determine prognostic factors. Patients who had HCC recurrence were further analyzed in terms of recurrent pattern, management, and outcome.Results:Seventeen patients (13.5%) exhibited HCC recurrence following LT. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified two prognostic factors: tumor number > three [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.249] and presence of microvascular invasion (HR = 4.336). Among patients with HCC recurrence, 15 out of 17 (88%) patients developed extrahepatic metastasis shortly after recurrence. The survival of patients after HCC recurrence was dismal with 18.3 months of median survival.Conclusions:Multiple tumors (>three) are an important prognostic factor for HCC recurrence following LT, but an accurate assessment of tumor status by pretransplantation radiological examination is required. The outcome of patients with HCC recurrence after LT remains very poor because of a tendency of HCC to recur as extrahepatic metastasis.
