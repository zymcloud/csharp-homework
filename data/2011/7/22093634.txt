Objective:To evaluate the therapeutic effect of endovascular placement of iodine-125 seed strand and stent combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumor thrombus in the main portal vein (MPVTT).Methods:Fifty patients with HCC complicated by MPVTT were enrolled into this study. There were 46 men and 4 women with a mean age of 53.9 years. TACE was performed after the iodine-125 seed strand and self-expandable stent placement in the obstructed segment of the main portal vein (MPV).Results:Technical success rate was 100% for placement of iodine-125 seed strand and stent in the target segment of MPV. No serious procedure-related complications occurred. The mean follow-up duration was 208.5 d. The mean and median survival time was 370.1 d and 223.0 d, respectively. The 90-, 180-, 360-day cumulative survival rates were 97.5%, 59.3%, and 38.4%, respectively. The mean and median patent time of stent was 524.2 d and 407.4 d, respectively. The 90-, 180-, 360-day cumulative patency rates of stent were 94.9%, 75.2%, and 64.5%, respectively.Conclusion:Endovascular placement of iodine-125 seed strand and stent combined with TACE is an effective therapy for HCC with tumor thrombus in the main portal vein.
