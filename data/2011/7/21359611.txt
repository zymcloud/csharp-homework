Purpose:An angiographic evaluation combined with (99m)Tc-macroaggregated albumin (Tc-MAA) scanning should precede the treatment of any selected candidates for radioembolization (RE) of the liver. If the tumours in one liver lobe have not been targeted in the test angiogram, it should be repeated. However, in a few cases treatment of one liver lobe or at least some segments is safe and feasible and performing a repeated test angiogram with Tc-MAA (Re-MAA) in a separate session leads to more radiation exposure and could be time consuming. Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility of concurrent RE of a part of the liver and therapy planning for another region by simultaneous injection of the Tc-MAA and (90)Y-microspheres in two different locations in the therapy session. Tc-MAA and bremsstrahlung (BS) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT were performed separately in an effort to distinguish between the distributions of these two different radiopharmaceuticals.Methods:RE was combined with a simultaneous second test angiogram of another lobe or segments in the same session in six patients [44-70 years; five women (83%)]. Five patients suffered from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and one from ovarian cancer. Tc-MAA and BS SPECT/CT were performed for all cases.Results:Post-therapeutic Tc-MAA SPECT/CT showed in all patients only the distribution of Tc-MAA without any detectable BS. Evaluation of (90)Y-microsphere distribution was not always possible in the post-therapeutic BS scan performed 24 h later due to remaining Tc-MAA radiation. However, scans performed at 48 h post-intervention no longer showed any Tc-MAA "contamination".Conclusion:Combining RE and Re-MAA is feasible in appropriately selected patients.
