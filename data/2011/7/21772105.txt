On routine endoscopy a Type 2 tumor was found in the esophagogastric junction of a 74-year-old man. A histological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma was made based on a biopsy specimen, and lower esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy were performed. The pathological diagnosis was pT3, N2, M0, pStage III. A low-dose FP treatment as adjuvant chemotherapy was given for only three weeks due to severe anorexia. A liver metastases measuring 22Ã—24 mm in diameter at the s6 lesion was found with a CT examination a year and a half after the operation. A dose of 70 mg/m2 of docetaxel was given by intervenous infusion, and repeated every four weeks. Toxicities, grade 4 neutropenia and mild pneumonia associated with this chemotherapy regimen, were observed after five cycles. Therefore this treatment was discontinued. CT performed at that time showed a complete response (CR) and no more recurrences for six months. Docetaxel treatment is considered to be safe for outpatients and is one of the cures for metastatic esophageal cancer.
