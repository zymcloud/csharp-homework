Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains an important cause of liver disease in the renal transplant (RT) population, potentially diminishing survival. Consequences of HBV infection after RT include progression to decompensated cirrhosis and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Although precautions initially recommended by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention 30 years ago have substantially reduced HBV transmission within hemodialysis units, acute HBV outbreaks continue to be reported in patients with chronic kidney disease on maintenance hemodialysis. In addition, immigration from areas of high HBV prevalence implies that HBV-infected organs with chronic kidney disease will continue to enter the RT pool. Fortunately, the advent of oral therapy for HBV infection now reduces the risk of HBV progression post-RT.
