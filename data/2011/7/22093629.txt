Objective:To compare the efficacy, side effects and influence of two chemotherapy regimens, paclitaxel liposome combined with platinum and paclitaxel combined with platinum, on the survival rate in patients with cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy.Methods:One hundred and sixty two cases with primary cervical carcinoma diagnosed and treated in the Jiangxi Maternal and Children Hospital between January 2008 and November 2009 were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial. Seventy one cases were included in the paclitaxel group and 91 in the paclitaxel liposome group. The chemotherapy doses were as followings: paclitaxel liposome and paclitaxel 135 mg/m(2); cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) or carboplatin AUC 4 - 6, repeated every 21 days for two or three times. Radical radiotherapy was given to both groups at the same time. The efficacy was evaluated by the tumor regression and the patients were followed-up for six months.Results:The overall response rates of paclitaxel group and paclitaxel liposome group were 90.1% and 89.0%, respectively (P > 0.05). The 1-year cumulative survival rate was 91.4% for the paclitaxel group and 89.2% for the paclitaxel liposom group (P > 0.05). The incidence rate of adverse effects such as rash, gastrointestinal toxicity, bone marrow suppression and muscle/joint pain in the paclitaxel liposome group was significantly lower than that in the paclitaxel group (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference regarding the hair loss, liver damage, and peripheral neuritis (P > 0.05).Conclusions:Paclitaxel liposome plus platinum is a safe and effective therapeutic regimen for stage IIa-IV cervical carcinoma. However, the long-term efficacy of this regimen should be further observed.
