Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common primary cancer frequently associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, whether these identified genes are particularly associated with HBV-related HCC remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the differential gene expression between HBV-related HCC tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues.Methods:cDNA microarray was used to detect the differential gene expression profile in the HBV-related HCC tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to verify the differential expression of candidate genes obtained from cDNA microarray experiment.Results:In this study, 1369 genes or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) including 121 genes or ESTs with at least two-fold expression alterations between cancerous and noncancerous tissues were identified. Special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB-1) expression was positive in 73% (16/22) of cancerous tissues and negative (0/22) in all noncancerous tissues of HBV-related HCC patients. Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 1 (TM4SF-1) expression was positive in 86% (19/22) of cancerous tissues and negative (0/22) in all noncancerous tissues. Suppression of tumorigenicity 14 (ST-14) expression was positive in 73% (16/22) of noncancerous tissues in patients with HBV-related HCC and negative in all HCC tissues (0/22).Conclusion:This study provided the gene expression profile of HBV-related HCC and presented differential expression patterns of SATB-1, TM4SF-1 and ST-14 between cancerous and noncancerous tissues in patients with HBV-related HCC.
