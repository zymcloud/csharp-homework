Median survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has increased significantly, owing to individualized treatment plans developed from the available multidisciplinary options for disease management. These plans include early evaluation for possible resection of hepatic metastases, and metastasectomy, as well as coordinated chemobiotherapy for unresectable patients. This article focuses on current management of mCRC, including resection of liver metastases, which offers the possibility of cure to selected patients; sequential chemobiotherapy, which has been used effectively to increase median survival of patients with unresectable mCRC; the roles of neoadjuvant, conversion, and adjuvant chemobiotherapy in patients who undergo hepatic resection; and the emerging use of biomarkers to guide therapy. Implications for nurses are summarized, underscoring the important role that the nurse plays in the increasingly complex treatment of mCRC.
