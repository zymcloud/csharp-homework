Aim:To construct recombinant co-expression adenovirus vector of SEA and CD80 genes regulated by mouse TERT(telomerase reverse transcriptase, TERT) promoter and to observe the expression of SEA and CD80 in the Hepa1-6 cells mediated by it.Methods:Using AdEasy adenovirus system, the core promoter region of mTERT was subcloned to shuttle plasmid pShuttle2 and Myc-Max response element was inserted upstream of it to regulate the expression of SEA and CD80. The recombinant co-expression adenovirus vector of SEA and CD80 genes was constructed and named as Ad-MMRE-mTERT-BIS. Hepatoma cell line Hepa1-6 and fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 were infected by recombinant adenovirus at MOI(multiplicity of infection)of 100, the expression of SEA and CD80 on the surface of cells was detected by indirect immunofluorescent staining.Results:SEA and CD80 was specifically co-expressed on the surface of infected Hepa1-6 cells but not on NIH3T3 cells.Conclusion:The recombinant co-expression adenovirus vector of SEA and CD80 gene regulated by mTERT promoter was sucessfully constructed and make targeting-expression of SEA and CD80 on the surface of hepatoma cells, which lays the foundation for further research on application of SEA and CD80 in targeted genetherapy for hepatoma.
