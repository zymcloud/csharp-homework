Background:The recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy is a serious event. It has been demonstrated that different ground-glass hepatocyte (GGH) patterns harbor specific hepatitis B virus (HBV) pre-S deletion mutants and represent preneoplastic lesions in chronic HBV infection. In the current study, the authors investigated whether a specific GGH pattern in nontumorous liver tissues was associated with the recurrence of HBV-related HCC after surgery.Methods:Clinicopathologic data from 82 patients with HBV-related HCC were reviewed. GGH patterns were assessed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Tissue hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Serum profiles of pre-S status, viral load, and HBV genotype were determined and correlated with clinical recurrence and survival after surgery.Results:The results indicated that the clustered pattern of GGHs or HBsAg expression was associated significantly with decreased local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) during a mean follow-up of 46.4 months (PConclusions:The current results indicated that the assessment of GGH patterns or HBsAg expression in nontumorous liver tissues provides an easily recognized, new risk marker for the recurrence of HBV-related HCC after hepatic resection.
