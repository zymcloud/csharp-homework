Bronchogenic carcinoma commonly metastasises to liver, bone, brain and adrenals. Involvement of mediastinal structures like superior vena cava, recurrent laryngeal nerve, phrenic nerve, pericardium, etc, is also common. But invasion of myocardium is very rare in bronchogenic carcinoma. A rare case of lung cancer with invasion to left atrium and ST segment elevation on electrocardiogram (ECG) mimicking myocardial infarction is presented here.
