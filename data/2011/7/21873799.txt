Jaundice occurs in 19%-40% of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. HCC associated jaundice may be divided into hepatocellular and icteric types in terms of its underlying pathophysiology. The jaundice of icteric type is caused by obstruction of the bile duct through cancer embolus, blood clot, biliary sludge, tumor compression or infiltration. Jaundice and epigastric discomforts are the main clinical manifestations. In the present case, severe acute pancreatitis and acute cholangitis presenting as initial complaints of icteric type HCC were quite rare. A tumor located at the central lobe of the liver and a cancer embolus at the lower part of the common bile duct (CBD) were detected by CT scan. Curative resection of HCC with CBD exploration eradicated both the tumor and the embolus, and no recurrence was found after a 36 month follow-up.
