Records from 6,706 necropsy examinations of cattle performed over a 45-year period were surveyed and 586 cases of neoplasia were identified. The organ system most frequently affected by neoplastic disease (n=139 cases) was the alimentary tract. This finding was attributed to a high incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the upper alimentary tract associated with the chronic ingestion of bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum). This carcinogenic plant was also associated with a relatively high incidence (n=35 cases) of urinary bladder tumours (enzootic haematuria). Tumours of the alimentary tract were followed, in decreasing order of frequency, by tumours of the skin and subcutis (n=129 cases), haemopoietic tissue (n=101 cases), the eye and periorbital tissues (n=88 cases), the urinary system (n=44 cases), the female reproductive system (n=21 cases), the endocrine system (n=16 cases), the liver and pancreas (n=12 cases), the nervous system (n=6 cases), the respiratory system (n=6 cases) and the mammary gland (n=1 case). The primary anatomical location of 16 tumours was undetermined.
