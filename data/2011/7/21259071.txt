Background:Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) remains to be established as a safe and effective alternative to open liver resection (OLR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Aims:The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare laparoscopic versus open resection for HCC with regard to perioperative and oncologic outcomes.Methods:A literature search was performed to identify comparative studies reporting outcomes for both laparoscopic and open resection for HCC. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and weighted mean differences (WMD with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using either the fixed effects model or random effects model.Results:Ten nonrandomized controlled studies matched the selection criteria and reported on 494 subjects, of whom 213 underwent LLR and 281 underwent OLR for HCC. Compared with the perioperative results of open surgery, reports on laparoscopic resection indicate potentially favourable outcomes in terms of operative blood loss (WMD: -160.57, 95% CI: -246.49 to -74.66), blood transfusion requirement (OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.86), postoperative morbidity (OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.78), and length of hospital stay (WMD: -5.53, 95% CI: -7.89 to -3.16). Concerning the oncologic outcomes, there was no difference between groups in surgical margin, overall survival and disease-free survival.Conclusions:LLR for HCC is superior to the OLR in terms of its perioperative results and does not compromise the oncological outcomes. Therefore, LLR may be an alternative choice for treatment of HCC.
