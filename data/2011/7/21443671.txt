Background and aim:Serum Golgi protein 73 (sGP73) is a novel and promising biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there are few reports on the pattern of GP73 expression in HCC and the relationship of this expression to clinicopathologic features of patients. This study aimed to investigate the expression of GP73 and it correlation with clinical parameters.Methods:We examined GP73 expression in HCC and adjacent paracarcinomatous liver (PCL) tissue in 36 HCC patients, and took 14 normal liver (NL) samples from hepatic hemangioma patients. Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used for analyses.Results:GP73 expression in HCC was significantly higher than in the corresponding PCL and NL samples at both protein and mRNA levels (P Conclusion:Significant overexpression of GP73 at both protein and mRNA levels along with overexpression of GP73 protein is associated with aggressive behavior of HCC, but not overall patient survival. Further research is needed to determine the potential of GP73 as a therapeutic target.
