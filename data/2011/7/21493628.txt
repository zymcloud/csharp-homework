Laforin is a dual specificity protein phosphatase involved in Lafora disease (LD), a fatal form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy characterized by neurodegeneration and the presence of intracellular polyglucosan inclusions (Lafora bodies) in different tissues. In this work, we describe that mice lacking laforin (epm2a-/-) have enhanced insulin response leading to altered whole-body energy balance. This enhanced insulin response overactivates the Akt pathway which increases glucose uptake in the heart, resulting in increased glycogen levels and the formation of polyglucosan inclusions. In addition, enhanced insulin response resulted in increased liver lipid biosynthesis, resulting in hepatic steatosis. On the contrary, overexpression in rat hepatoma FTO2B cells of native laforin but not of a form lacking phosphatase activity (C266S) resulted in attenuation of insulin signaling. These results define laforin as a new regulator of insulin sensitivity, which provides novel insights into LD pathogenesis and identifies this phosphatase as a potential novel component of the insulin signaling cascade.
