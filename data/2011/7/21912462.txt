The development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is attributed to several factors, including chronic viral infection, alcohol consumption, exposure to aflatoxin B1 and metabolic disorders. Several recent reports have shown that HCC can occur in patients with long-standing Crohn's disease (CD) in the absence of other underlying high-risk liver diseases. There may be an association between CD and hepatocarcinogenesis, however, the precise mechanism for this requires further investigations.
