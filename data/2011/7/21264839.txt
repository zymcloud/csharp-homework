Background:Anti-angiogenesis agents have shown effectiveness in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is important to investigate more effective and safe systemic treatment options for patients with advanced HCC. This phase 2 study was designed to determine the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of bevacizumab, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced unresectable and untransplantable HCC.Methods:Chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced unresectable and untransplantable HCC were treated with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle, and capecitabine 825 mg/mÂ² orally twice a day from days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle.Results:Forty patients were enrolled to the study, in which 40% had Child-Pugh B disease. Forty percent had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) of 0, 55% had PS of 1, and 5% had PS of 2. Forty percent of patients had hepatitis B virus infection. The median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI, 3.4-9.1 months), and the median overall survival was 9.8 months (95% CI, 5.2-12.1 months). Eight patients (20%) achieved partial response; 23 patients had stable disease with overall 77.5% disease control rate. The combination was tolerable with limited grade 3/4 toxicity, mainly peripheral neurotoxicity and fatigue.Conclusions:The combination appeared effective and safe, and the results were encouraging. Further investigation should be considered.
