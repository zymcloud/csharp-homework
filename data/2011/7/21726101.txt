Background:Hepatitis B virus initiates a complicated cascade process leading to chronic hepatitis B, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In inflammatory situations, myeloperoxidase is released in plasma and binds to apolipoprotein A-1 in high-density lipoproteins. This study aims to evaluate the level of plasma myeloperoxidase as well as the pattern of plasma proteins in patients with chronic hepatitis B.Methods:Included in this study were 30 male subjects: 19 chronic hepatitis B patients, 6 HBV-related cirrhotic patients, and 5 healthy controls. Plasma myeloperoxidase was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Proteomic analysis of plasma proteins was performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry. One way ANOVA was used for data analysis.Results:Mean plasma myeloperoxidase levels were higher in patients with liver cirrhosis (65.5±12.5; P=0.007) and chronic hepatitis B (53.7±10.6; P=0.18) when compared with healthy subjects (45±7.6). Moreover, a positive correlation was found between plasma myeloperoxidase levels and hepatic fibrosis stage (r=0.53, P=0.002; r=0.63, P=0.000). Proteomic analysis showed an altered plasma protein pattern in progressive hepatitis B and down-regulation of the major apolipoprotein A-1 along with the appearance of a variety of spots noted to be apolipoprotein A-1isoforms with different molecular masses.Conclusion:In this study, progressive liver injury due to HBV infection correlated with higher plasma myeloperoxidase and an altered plasma apolipoprotein A-1pattern.
