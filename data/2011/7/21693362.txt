The renal carcinoma is situated in the third rank of the urologic cancers. It is metastatic in a third of the cases, when we made the diagnosis of the cancer. Lungs, bone, the liver, the suprarenal gland and the brain stay metastatic sites of preference. Some metastatic locations are anecdotal and made the object of some publications. We report the case of a cardiac metastasis of renal carcinoma at an old patient 81 years old operated for cardiac tumor.
