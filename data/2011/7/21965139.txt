Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with atypical cytomorphological features and presenting with bone and soft tissue metastasis is very rare. We report a 65-year-old male patient of HCC who presented with bone and soft tissue metastases and was clinically and radiologically suspected to have a soft tissue sarcoma. The patient presented with severe cervical pain with palpable masses in right scapular, nape of neck, and occiput area of scalp. Radiologically, these were large, bulky soft tissue masses expansile, destructive, and lytic in nature. Cytomorphologic studies revealed HCC with uncommon features of multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cell and very prominent intracytoplasmic hyaline bodies (IHBs). Cytology, immunohistochemistry on cell block preparation, rising serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (1121.93-5000 ng/ml), and PIVKA II levels confirmed the diagnosis. The patient has been on follow-up on sorafinib for 2 months and is doing well. This case emphasizes the need for systematic approach in cases of HCC with atypical clinical presentation and unusual cytomorphology.
