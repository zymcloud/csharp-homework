Superior soft-tissue contrast affords magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) some advantages compared to computed tomography (CT) in both detection and characterization of focal liver lesions. Because of its relatively recently introduction into clinical practice, a growing number of articles in the literature have demonstrated the usefulness of the hepatobiliary-specific MRI contrast agent gadoxetic acid disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) in liver imaging. The purpose of this review is to demonstrate the typical enhancement patterns of the most common liver lesions using Gd-EOB-DTPA in daily clinical scenarios and briefly describe its mechanism of action. Radiologists interpreting liver MRI studies with this agent must be familiar with the appearance of focal lesions in the hepatocyte phase to avoid misinterpretation.
