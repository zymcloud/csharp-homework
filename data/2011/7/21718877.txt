We report a resection of a posterior mediastinal metastasis of colon cancer. A 29-year-old man who had undergone a right hemicolectomy and liver resection for ascending colon cancer with liver metastasis was referred to our hospital with the diagnosis of a solitary posterior mediastinal metastasis. Tumor extirpation with descending aorta replacement was performed. Five months after the operation, local recurrence developed in the posterior mediastinum, which was also resected. He has been recurrence-free for 5 years since the second procedure. In this case, the metastases were believed to have occurred through the thoracic duct.
