A 65-year-old man presented with gross hematuria in 2004. Computed tomography (CT) showed a left renal mass, and he underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. Pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma (pT2N0M0, G2ï¼žG3). Four years later, a right adrenal tumor was disclosed by follow-up CT. Then laparoscopic adrenectomy was performed. Histology showed metastasis of the renal clear cell carcinoma. In 2009, he noticed gross hematuria, and cystoscopy revealed a 2cm solitary, non-papillary tumor at the anterior wall of the bladder. At the same time, small solitary liver metastasis (6 mm) was observed on abdominal CT. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor and resection of liver tumor was performed, and pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma both in vesical and hepatic masses. Nine months after the last surgery, he is living with no obvious tumor recurrence. To our knowledge this case is the 34th case of bladder metastasis from renal cell carcinoma in the Japanese literature. We reviewed literature and discuss the clinical features of bladder metastasis of renal cell carcinoma.
