Background/aims:The detoxification enzyme AKR1B10, a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, is discussed as a new biomarker candidate for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Only rare clinicopathological data on AKRB1B10 in HCC exist. This retrospective study determines the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of AKR1B10 expression in HCC and its relationship to a series of clinicopathological parameters including underlying aetiological factors.Methods:A series of 168 patients with HCCs treated either by surgical resection (n=92) or liver transplantation (n=76) were investigated after construction of a tissue micro-array. Immunohistochemically confirmed AKR1B10 expression was correlated with clinicopathologically relevant parameters as well as proliferative activity (indicated by Ki-67 immunostaining) and apoptosis (terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling).Results:AKR1B10 overexpression is significantly associated with lower pT-classification (P=0.030) and highly statistically associated with an underlying viral hepatitis (PConclusions:This study confirms and expands data on the expression of AKR1B10 in HCC, suggesting that this enzyme is a valuable novel biomarker candidate for staging of HCC, especially in patients with underlying virus hepatitis or cirrhosis, and may present a new therapeutic target for multimodal therapy concepts. We confirm its prognostic value and conclude that high expression of AKR1B10 reflects a less aggressive tumour behaviour.
