Optimal management of asymptomatic generalized rectal cancer is still the matter of debate. The aim of the study was to review stage IV rectal cancer patients who were treated in our clinic since 2000 till 2008 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of surgery.Material and methods:Fifty-two generalized rectal cancer patients treated with elective resection of primary tumor were identified. Patients' age, sex, duration of hospital stay, modality of surgery, complications, postoperative mortality rate and survival rate were assessed.Results:Median survival was 16.3 months. Postoperative complications occurred in 29% patients. Postoperative mortality rate was 1.9%.Conclusions:In properly selected group of patients elective resection of primary tumor may cause low mortality rate and acceptable morbidity rate. This surgical modality allows to avoid potential complications of tumor local growth.
