Objective:To explore the effect and mechanism of tagalsin on hepatoma cells.Methods:The animal models were established by transplanting H(22) mouse hepatoma cells to mouse liver, and ten days later the mice were randomly divided into five groups: blank group, carmofur positive group and tagalsin groups, including low-dose, middle-dose and high-dose groups. Then medicine or oil was given to the mice by gastric gavage in consecutive 5 days with a 2-days interval as a course of treatment, two courses in all. All mice were killed at 24 hours after medication, and the survival period, ascites conditions, aggressive conditions intra- or extra-liver, weight changes, tumor volume and spleen index of the tumor-bearing mice were observed. Pathological changes of the tumors were examined. Apoptotic factors p53 and Bcl-2 protien and mRNA were detected by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Results:tagalsin inhibited the hepatoma growth effectively without influencing spleen index to some extent. The tumor inhibition rate of tagalsin low, middle and high dose groups were 17.9%, 63.1% and 71.8%, respectively. Immunohistochemical results showed that the p53 and Bcl-2 protein positive cell counts of the positive control and experimental groups were significantly lower than those of the blank group (P Conclusions:tagalsin can inhibit the growth of mouse hepatoma cells significantly. The mechanism of its anti-tumor effect may work via up-regulating the wild type p53 gene expression and down-regulating Bcl-2 gene expression and thus regulating tumor cell apoptosis.
