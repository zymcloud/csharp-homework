Objective:To study the effects of placement of double cannula using trocar puncture for intra-abdominal abscess drainage.Methods:A retrospective study was performed to investigate the clinical data of 32 patients undergoing intra-abdominal abscess drainage with double cannula placed using trocar puncture between June 2010 and December 2010.Techniques:the location and size of the abscess was evaluated by ultrasound and CT. Placement of double cannula using trocar puncture was performed under CT or ultrasound guidance.Results:Trocar puncture was successful in all the patients. One patient died of liver metastasis and multiple organ failure after surgery for pancreatic cancer. One patient required laparotomy and drainage because non-localization of sepsis from intestinal fistula. The remaining 30 patients experienced alleviation of septic symptoms after drainage and eventually cured. The mean healing time was(7Â±3) days. Two patients developed subcutaneous bleeding and were management by local compression.Conclusions:Placement of double cannula using trocar puncture for intra- abdominal abscess drainage results in satisfactory outcomes. This technique is especially suitable for abscesses with viscous drainage, those with the presence of phlegmon or necrotic debris, and those with multiple large cavities.
