Background:Liver stiffness assessed using transient elastography is described as a potential risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis. However, the strict assessment of hepatic parenchymal areas uninvolved with HCC has not been investigated.Aim:To determine if liver stiffness of nonmalignant hepatic parenchyma using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is higher in patients with HCC compared with controls.Methods:Cases were defined by compensated cirrhosis with a Child-Turcotte-Pugh score Results:Thirty patients with HCC and 60 matched controls comprised the study cohort. The mean age for cases was 64±10 years (range, 45-85) with 70% being men. Major disease aetiologies were chronic viral hepatitis (57%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (33%) and alcohol (10%). Twenty-eight (93%) patients had solitary HCC lesions with a mean size of 5.2 cm (range, 2-14 cm). However, patients with HCC had similar liver stiffness among uninvolved areas distant to HCC lesions, when compared with controls without HCC (mean, 6.1±2.0 vs. 6.3±2.5 kPa, P=0.7).Conclusion:In contrast to previous studies with transient elastography, we did not observe a systematic association between liver stiffness assessed using MRE and the presence of HCC in patients with compensated cirrhosis.
