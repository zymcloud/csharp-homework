Since the fast expansion of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) over last few decades, small-for-size syndrome (SFSS) has emerged as a tough problem. Herein the first case of LDLT combined hemi-portocaval shunt in the mainland of China was reported. Portal venous over perfusion was well modulated and the recipient recovered uneventfully. LDLT combined hemi-portocaval shunt was a feasible procedure for preventing SFSS in LDLT.
