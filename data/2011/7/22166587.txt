In order to investigate the relationship between hemostatic abnormalities and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), platelets, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time, fibrinogen, d-dimer, fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs), protein C, protein S, antithrombin, plasminogen, antiplasmin, coagulation factors (CFs) V, VII, VIII, IX, XI, and XIII, von Willebrand factor (vWF), prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (PF 1 + 2), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) were studied in patients with HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, and metastatic liver tumors and in cirrhosis patients with or without PVT. Platelet, antithrombin, protein C, plasminogen, and CFs V, VII, IX, XI, and XIII levels of HCC group were found lower and PT, aPTT, thrombin time, vWF, FDPs, PF 1 + 2, tPA, and PAI-1 levels were higher than the control group. Our findings suggested that the abnormalities of coagulation and fibrinolysis systems have some role in provoking thrombosis of portal veins in HCC, in addition to the invasion of portal veins by hepatoma cells.
