Introduction:The aim of this study is to evaluate the appropriate treatment for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Of 151 patients who underwent initial hepatectomy for HCC, 82 had intrahepatic recurrence and were divided into two groups: group A, ≤2 tumors, each 3 cm in size; and group B, beyond the group A. Survival and treatment in each group were analyzed retrospectively to determine the best therapeutic modality for intrahepatic recurrence.Results:The 5-year overall survival and recurrence rate were 65% and 58%, respectively. Overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates after recurrence were better in group A (100%, 76%, and 54%) than in group B (74%, 23%, and 5.8%; p Conclusions:Repeat hepatectomy and ablation therapy were more effective than TACE in the group with ≤2 tumors up to 3 cm in size at recurrence, while any treatment modality was more effective than best supportive care, but the outcome was poorer in the group with ≥3 tumors or tumor size ≥3 cm at recurrence.
