Many chronic hepatitis patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are observed to have a degree of steatosis which is a factor in the progression of liver diseases. Transgenic mice expressing HCV core protein develop liver steatosis before the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting active involvement of HCV in the de-regulation of lipid metabolism in host cells. However, the role of lipid metabolism in HCV life cycle has not been fully understood until the establishment of in vitro HCV infection and replication system. In this review we focus on HCV production with regard to modification of lipid metabolism observed in an in vitro HCV infection and replication system. The importance of lipid droplet to HCV production has been recognized, possibly at the stage of virus assembly, although the precise mechanism of lipid droplet for virus production remains elusive. Association of lipoprotein with HCV in circulating blood in chronic hepatitis C patients is observed. In fact, HCV released from culture medium is also associated with lipoprotein. The fact that treatment of HCV fraction with lipoprotein lipase (LPL) abolished infectivity indicates the essential role of lipoprotein's association with virus particle in the virus life cycle. In particular, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a component of lipoprotein associated with HCV plays a pivotal role in HCV infectivity by functioning as a virus ligand to lipoprotein receptor that also functions as HCV receptor. These results strongly suggest the direct involvement of lipid metabolism in the regulation of the HCV life cycle.
