Aim:To analyze the long-term prognosis in a cohort of western cirrhotic patients with single hepatocellular carcinoma treated with ethanol injection.Methods:One-hundred forty-eight patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. The tumor diameter was lower than 2 cm in 47 patients but larger in the remaining 101 patients. The impact of some pre-treatment clinical and laboratory parameters and of tumor recurrence on patients' survival was assessed.Results:Among the pre-treatment parameters, only a tumor diameter of less than 2 cm was an independent prognostic factor of survival. The occurrence of new nodules in other liver segments and the neoplastic portal invasion were linked to a poorer prognosis at univariate analysis. Patients with a single hepatocellular carcinoma smaller than 2 cm showed a better 5-year cumulative survival (73.0% vs 47.9%) (P = 0.009), 3-year local recurrence rate (29.1% vs 51.5%) (P = 0.011), and 5-year distant intrahepatic recurrence rate (52.9% vs 62.8%) (P = 0.054) compared to patients with a larger tumor.Conclusion:The 5-year survival rate of patients with single hepatocellular carcinoma
