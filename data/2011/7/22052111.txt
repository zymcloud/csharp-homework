Background:Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is seldom available because of the lack of reliable markers. Survivin is an anti-apoptotic protein that is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle, and it is undetectable in normal adult tissues but is overexpressed in various types of cancers. Survivin is thus commonly considered to be a marker of malignancy. The aim of this study was to explore the association between survivin gene polymorphisms and the risk and diagnostic progress of HCC.Methods:A total of 135 patients with HCC and 496 healthy control subjects were recruited. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of survivin genes were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and further analyzed statistically.Results:We first found that the -241 C/T and -235 G/A genetic polymorphisms of survivin did not occur frequently enough or even lacked in Taiwanese population. The +9809 C/C polymorphism exhibited a significant (P Conclusions:Survivin +9809 polymorphic genotype is associated with the risk of HCC, and the HCC patients with survivin +9809 CC homozygotes might have a low risk of developing infected HCV-dependent HCC. The results suggest that the survivin T9809C SNP might contribute to the prediction of susceptibility and pathological development to HCC.
