Iron-induced oxidative stress promotes hepatic injury in hereditary hemochromatosis, which can be influenced by genetic traits affecting antioxidant enzymes. We assessed the influence of Ala16Val-superoxide dismutase 2, Pro198Leu-glutathione peroxidase 1, and -463G/A-myeloperoxidase genotypes (high activity for the Ala, Pro, and G alleles, respectively) on the risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients homozygous for the C282Y-hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutation. Both the 2G-myeloperoxidase genotype and carriage of one or two copies of the Ala-superoxide dismutase 2 allele were more frequent in patients with cirrhosis or HCC. Patients cumulating these two genetic traits had higher rates of cirrhosis and HCC than other patients.
