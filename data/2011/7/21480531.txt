We present a general approach for the selective imaging and killing of cancer cells using protein-activated near-infrared emitting and cytotoxic oxygen generating nanoparticles. Poly(propargyl acrylate) (PA) particles were surface modified through the copper-catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition of azide-terminated indocyanine green (azICG), a near-infrared emitter, and poly(ethylene glycol) (azPEG) chains of various molecular weights. The placement of azICG onto the surface of the particles allowed for the chromophores to complex with bovine serum albumin when dispersed in PBS that resulted in an enhancement of the dye emission. In addition, the inclusion of azPEG with the chromophores onto the particle surface resulted in a synergistic ninefold enhancement of the fluorescence intensity, with azPEGs of increasing molecular weight amplifying the response. Human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) overexpress albumin proteins and could be employed to activate the fluorescence of the nanoparticles. Preliminary PDT studies with HepG2 cells combined with the modified particles indicated that a minor exposure of 780 nm radiation resulted in a statistically significant reduction in cell growth.
