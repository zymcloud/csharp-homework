Purpose:To evaluate the factors associated with tumor response and survival after chemoembolization in 362 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Between January 2006 and August 2006, 362 patients who underwent chemoembolization for unresectable HCC were evaluated. The endpoints were tumor response and patient survival. Factors associated with tumor response were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Factors associated with patient survival were evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis.Results:After chemoembolization, 69% of the study patients showed a tumor response. On multivariate analysis, tumor size (centimeter) (odds ratio [OR] 2.85, P = .002), tumor number (OR 4.58, P Conclusions:Tumor size, tumor vascularity, tumor number, and portal vein invasion are significant independent predictors of tumor response after chemoembolization in patients with unresectable HCC. Child-Pugh class B or C, large tumor size (â‰¥ 4 cm), multiple tumors (five or more), portal vein invasion, and a high AFP value (> 83 ng/mL) indicated poor prognosis for overall patient survival after chemoembolization.
