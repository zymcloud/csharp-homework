For the diabetologist, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is important at both ends of its spectrum. It is an early warning sign of future risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. It may also lead to late life-threatening sequela of diabetes mellitus in the event of progression to liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. This review will highlight the recent progress in understanding the natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and in developing a rational approach to its diagnosis, staging, and management. The pandemic prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Western countries necessitates both a high index of suspicion to identify cases and a non-invasive approach to staging, which is best achieved with clinical/biochemical panels and transient elastography. Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of management. Recent clinical trials provide support for pharmacologic therapies directed at the metabolic syndrome and at protecting the liver but more data are needed. Bariatric surgery is appropriate for high-risk patients who fail conservative management. Patients with liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma may be candidates for liver transplantation.
