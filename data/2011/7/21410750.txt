Background and aim:Fucosylated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) is known to be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it has been difficult to measure AFP-L3 under low AFP (≤ 20 ng/mL). The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of AFP-L3 in HCC patients with low AFP conditions.Methods:One hundred and ninety six consecutive newly developed HCC patients with low AFP (≤ 20 ng/mL) were examined for serum AFP-L3 expression by a newly-developed micro-total analysis system that could stably measure AFP-L3 in low AFP circumstances, and its clinical importance was analyzed.Results:Positivity of AFP-L3 in HCC patients was 13.3% at a cut-off level of 10%. Five-year survivals of HCC patients with AFP-L3 (Conclusions:AFP-L3 is a strong prognostic factor for survival even in HCC patients with low AFP (≤ 20 ng/mL).
