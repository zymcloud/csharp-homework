Background and aim:To evaluate the efficacy of intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and subcutaneous interferon (IFN) combined with image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).Methods:Twenty HCC patients with PVTT were treated with 5-FU and IFN combined with image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) (IGRT group), and as controls, 20 patients with PVTT were treated with 5-FU and IFN alone (non-IGRT group). Overall survival (OS) time, response rates, time to progression (TTP) and safety were compared across groups.Results:Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) of PVTT were 5%, 55%, 40% and 0% in the IGRT group and 0%, 30%, 35% and 35%, in the non-IGRT group, respectively. CR, PR, SD, and PD of the whole tumor were 0%, 35%, 45% and 20% in the IGRT group and 0%, 30%, 35% and 35%, in the non-IGRT group, respectively. Overall median survival was significantly longer in the IGRT group (12.0 months 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.3-17.6 months) than in the non-IGRT group (9.1 months [95% CI, 5.5-11.1 months]) (P = 0.041). TTP was significantly longer in the IGRT group (6.9 months [95% CI, 5.6-10.2 months]) than in the non-IGRT group (4.0 months [95% CI, 3.3-6.4 months]) (P = 0.034).Conclusions:The response rates, median OS time and TTP in patients with advanced HCC with PVTT who received this novel combination therapy of intra-arterial 5-FU and subcutaneous IFN with IGRT are encouraging, and this combination therapy warrants further investigation.
