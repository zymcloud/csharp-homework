We present the case of a 76-year-old woman with a poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (PDNEC) of the ascending colon with liver metastases responding to calboplatin (CBDCA)/etoposide (ETP). She was admitted to our hospital with bloody stools, and was diagnosed with ascending colon cancer and multiple liver tumors. Total colonoscopy showed a Type 2 tumor in the ascending colon, and histological findings revealed adenocarcinoma from biopsy specimens. Right hemicolectomy with lymph nodes dissection was performed. Histologically, the tumor displayed PDNEC, the last feature identified by immunohistochemical markers for chromogranin and synaptophysin. After surgery, a combination of CBDCA and ETP was administered based on the chemotherapy for small-cell lung carcinoma in elderly, and there was a partial response and good control without emerging new lesions for more than two years.
