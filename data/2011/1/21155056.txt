A liver transplantation is a treatment option in selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite the adequate selection of candidates, recurrences of HCC may still develop. Solitary extrahepatic metastasis from HCC after a liver transplantation is rare. Here we report two cases of HCC demonstrated extrahepatic recurrence to the adrenal gland and spleen, respectively, within one year after a liver transplantation. Since the treatment of solitary extrahepatic metastasis from HCC after a liver transplantation is not standardized, surgical resection was performed. In the case of HCC adrenal metastasis, innumerable intrahepatic metastases were found two months after the adrenalectomy. And 16 months after adrenalectomy, the patient expired due to tumor progression and hepatic failure. In the case of HCC splenic metastasis, postoperative radiation therapy was performed. However, two recurrent HCC nodules were found 15 months after the splenectomy and received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). And 29 month after the splenectomy, the patient also expired as same causes of former patient.
