Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has a wide variety of clinical outcomes, it could be spontaneouly recovered and also could develop fulminant liver failure or cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphism and HBV (sub)genotypes have been speculated to associate with the outcome of HBV infection because the data obtained from various populations who bear different HLA alleles have shown a HLA polymorphism associated outcome of HBV infection. However, as the most important viral and host genetic factors, the impact of HBV (sub)genotypes in combination with HLA polymorphism on the clinical outcomes of HBV infections remains unclear. To demonstrate the association of HLA allele polymorphism in combination with HBV subgenotypes with the outcome of HBV infection in Northeastern Han Chinese population, a total of 230 HBV-infected individuals (Infection group) were compared to 210 random selected controls (Control group) who are negative for HBV infection for their HLA alleles frequency as well as the associations with the virus infection, clearance and persistence in combination with HBV subgenotypes. Of the 230 HBV-infected subjects, 54 were acute self-limited hepatitis (ASH) with HBV subgenotype C2 (ASH-C2), 144 were chronic hepatitis (CH) with HBV subgenotype C2 and B2 (CH-C2 and CH-B2), and 32 were spontaneously recovered (SR) without subgenotype results. When two groups are compared, the results suggest that B*48, B*51 and DRB1*12 carrier may have a high risk for HBV infection, but B*51 is likely association with spontaneous recovery and DRB1*07, 12 may be implied in viral persistence. HLA-B*15, DRB1*11 and 14 associated with viral clearance in the cases of HBV-C2 infection; HLA-B*54 carriers in chronic group are more sensitive to with the infection of HBV subgenotype B2; HLA-B*07 and DRB1*13 may protect subjects from HBV infection. The data presented a link between HLA polymorphism and HBV pathogenesis and suggested potential therapeutic targets for hepatitis B.
