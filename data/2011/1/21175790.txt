Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a benign liver neoplasm with a risk of spontaneous bleeding and malignant transformation. The aim of this review article is to review all the case reports and case series of patients with HCA from 1998 to 2008 in China and other parts of the world in order to compare clinical presentation, surgical management and outcomes. A search for all reports of HCA in the world literature from 1998 to 2008 was performed. A total of 356 patients were identified, including 191 patients from China, 104 from Europe, 46 from North America, and 15 from South-East Asia. A female predominance was not observed in Chinese patients in contrast to the other regions. Acute/chronic abdominal pain was the main clinical presentation in all regions. Twenty patients were diagnosed with coexistent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) was found among six of them. The management of HCA consisted of resection in most cases. The clinical presentation of HCA in China differed from other parts of the world regarding male predominance and a higher incidence of coexistent HCC in China. This might be the result of the birth control policy in China, limited oral contraceptive use, and the higher incidence of HBV.
