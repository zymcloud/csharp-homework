Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of death in the malignant neoplastic diseases in the world. Surgical operation is sometimes not indicated because of complicated liver cirrhosis and extrahepatic disorders. Radiofrequency ablation has been developed as a less invasive treatment for HCC since 1999, and long-term outcome has been shown. There are several complications which should be paid attention, and to improve the prognosis, combination treatment with transarterial chemoembolization should be discussed. Overall survival after between RFA and surgical resection should be compared prospectively. Establishment of staging system for treatment allocation of HCC and prevention of HCC recurrence is important issue to be examined.
