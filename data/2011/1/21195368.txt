Viral hepatitis B is a leading cause of acute and chronic liver disease worldwide, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Vaccination is the most effective measure for controlling and preventing hepatitis B and its severe long-term sequelae. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), by the end of 2008 177 countries had introduced hepatitis B vaccination into their national routine neonatal, infant and/or adolescent immunisation programmes, and Italy was one of the first countries to implement a universal strategy of hepatitis B vaccination. The implementation of such vaccination programmes has globally resulted in a marked decrease in disease burden, in the carrier rate and in hepatitis B-related morbidity and mortality. Despite this success, work remains to be done to fully achieve the WHO goal of control of hepatitis B and HBV-related diseases on a global scale.
