FOXO1, a member of the winged-helix family of transcription factors, is a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in regulating a variety of cellular processes including glucose homeostasis, apoptosis, cell cycle control, muscle differentiation, and angiogenesis. In addition to these biological functions, FOXO1 is a key player in the oxidative stress response by stimulating the expression of metal-containing anti-oxidant proteins such as manganese superoxide dismutase, selenoprotein P, and catalase. Evidence in the literature suggests that FOXO1 may also be capable of regulating the expression of the anti-oxidant protein Ceruloplasmin (Cp), a six-copper-containing protein synthesized and secreted mainly by the liver. In the present report, we demonstrate that FOXO1 stimulates Cp promoter activity in conjunction with the cytokine IL-6. Through deletional analysis and in vitro binding studies, we determine the DNA sequence responsible for the FOXO1-dependent regulation of the Cp proximal promoter. Finally, we demonstrate that FOXO1 is capable of enhancing the expression of endogenous Cp in human hepatic carcinoma cells treated with IL-6. These results allow us to identify FOXO1 as a regulator of Cp expression to promote the anti-oxidant pathway in response to IL-6 signaling.
