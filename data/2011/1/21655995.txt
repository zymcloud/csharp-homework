Background:Docetaxel and oxaliplatin are active agents for advanced gastric cancer (GC). The combination of these two drugs in a triweekly schedule is an active and attractive regimen for gastric cancer but with significant hematological toxicities. A multicenter phase II study was designed to establish an active regimen with good tolerability by using a weekly docetaxel-oxaliplatin (DO) combination in GC patients.Methods:Eligible patients had histologically confirmed stage IV gastric cancer without previous palliative chemotherapy; age ≥18 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2; at least one measurable lesion; and adequate hematological, renal, and liver functions. All patients received premedications with dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonist before the chemotherapy. Docetaxel (Taxotere®; Sanofi-Aventis) 30 mg/m(2) followed by oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®; Sanofi-Aventis) 65 mg/m(2) were administered on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 3.0. Tumor responses were evaluated every 2 cycles by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Guidelines.Results:From May 2007 to December 2008, a total of 47 patients were enrolled. There were 8 females and 39 males with a median age of 57 years (range 26-76). Forty-three patients were evaluable for response. Two patients obtained a complete response (4.7%) and 12 patients had a partial response (27.9%), with an overall response rate of 32.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.1-48.5); 20 patients experienced stable disease (46.5%), and the disease progressed in 9 patients (20.9%). Median time to disease progression was 4.2 months and median overall survival was 8.3 months. All 47 patients were assessable for toxicity. Major grade 3/4 hematological toxicities were anemia (5 patients, 10.6%), neutropenia (2 patients, 4.3%), and leukopenia (1 patient, 2.1%). The most common grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicities were fatigue (3 patients, 6.4%) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation in 3 patients (6.4%).Conclusions:The combination of weekly DO demonstrated a well-tolerated profile with moderate activity in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. Further studies of the combination together with a fluoropyrimidine are warranted.
