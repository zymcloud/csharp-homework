The term 'nanoclay' generically refers to the natural clay mineral, montmorillonite, with silica and alumina as the dominant constituents. The incorporation of nanoclays into polymeric systems dramatically enhances their barrier properties as well as their thermal and mechanical resistance. Consequently, nanoclays are employed in a wide range of industrial applications with recent studies reporting potential use in the modulation of drug release. With the increase in manufacturing of nanoclay-containing products, information on the toxicological and health effects of nanoclay exposure is warranted. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of two different nanoclays: the unmodified nanoclay, Cloisite Na+ ®, and the organically modified nanoclay, Cloisite 93A®, in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Following 24 h exposure the nanoclays significantly decreased cell viability. Cloisite Na+ induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation which coincided with increased cell membrane damage, whilst ROS generation did not play a role in Cloisite 93A-induced cell death. Neither of the nanoclays induced caspase-3/7 activation. Moreover, in the cell culture medium the nanoclays aggregated differently and this appeared to have an effect on their mechanisms of toxicity. Taken together, our data demonstrate that nanoclays are highly cytotoxic and as a result pose a possible risk to human health.
