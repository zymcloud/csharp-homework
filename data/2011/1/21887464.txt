Proteins involved in the G1 phase of the cell cycle are aberrantly expressed, sometimes in mutated forms, in human cancers including human hepatocellular carcinoma. Upon attack by a DNA-damaging anticancer drug, a cell arrests at the G1 phase; this is a safety feature prohibiting entry of DNA-damaged cells into S-phase. p21WAF1/CIP1 prevents damaged cells from progressing to the next cell cycle. Here, we show that, in response to mitomycin C and doxorubicin, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells generate conflicting signals, mediated by cyclin E and p21WAF1/CIP1, which respectively accelerates and represses cell cycle transition. Exposure to these anticancer drugs led to rapid accumulation of cyclin E in both p53-proficient HepG2 and p53-deficient Hep3B cells. Such anticancer drug-induced cyclin E accumulation influenced the G1-S-phase transition, but not DNA fragmentation-mediated death. In p53-proficient HepG2 cells, accumulation of cyclin E was followed by an increase in the level of p53-dependent p21WAF1/CIP1, thereby inhibiting further the G1-S-phase transition. Sublethal drug concentrations also induced rapid accumulation of cyclin E, but p21WAF1/CIP1 accumulation was delayed, further facilitating the G1-S-phase transition. Eventually, most cells arrested in G2/M. Thus, mitomycin C- or doxorubicin-induced conflicting signals, mediated by cyclin E and p21WAF1/CIP1, are in play in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Damaged G1 cells either immediately enter S-phase, or do not do so at all, depending on the extent of DNA damage.
