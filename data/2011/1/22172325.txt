Ethnopharmacological relevance:Solanum nigrum L. (SNL), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb endowed with diuretic, antipyretic and hepatoprotective effects, has been used as a major ingredient of folk prescriptions for anticancer treatment in China.Aim of the study:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of solamargine (SM), a major steroidal alkaloid glycoside purified from SNL, on human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells and investigate the possible mechanism of SM.Materials and methods:The MTT assay was used to evaluate the IC(50) on tumor cell lines. The effect on morphology was observed with a light or fluorescence microscopy. The rate of apoptosis and the cell cycle were measured using flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of caspase-3 protein was measured by colorimetric assay.Results:SM significantly inhibited the growth of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells and induced cell apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed that SM caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Moreover, SM could up-regulate the expression of caspase-3.Conclusions:This study indicated that SM exerted potential anticancer activity on SMMC-7721 cells in vitro through the activation of caspase-3 and the regulation of the cell cycle progression to induce apoptosis and inhibit hepatoma cells proliferation.
