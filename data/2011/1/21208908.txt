Purpose:This phase I study was conducted to characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the maximum-tolerated dose of E7820, a novel oral sulfonamide derivative with antiangiogenic properties, when administered to patients with advanced solid malignancies.Patients and methods:Patients received single daily doses of E7820 orally for 28 days in cycle 1, followed by a 7-day no-treatment period, after which time-uninterrupted daily dosing ensued. The starting dose of E7820 was 10 mg/d, which was increased to 20, 40, 70, 100, and 200 mg/d in cohorts of new patients.Results:Thirty-seven patients [21 male; median age 65 (40-82] were enrolled. At 100 mg/d, 1 patient experienced a DLT consisting of grade 3 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. At the 200-mg dose level, 2 patients experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. No partial or complete responses were observed; 8 patients had stable disease (≥ 4 months), including 5 patients with protracted stable disease exceeding 6 months. Mean time to maximum plasma concentration values ranged from 1 to 12 hours, whereas mean terminal half-life values ranged from 5.6 to 8.6 hours. Flow cytometric analysis of platelet integrin α-2 expression showed a sustained greater than 50% decrease beyond day 28 in 3 of 4 patients at 200 mg, whereas moderate (<30%) decreases were observed at 70- and 100-mg dose levels.Conclusions:The recommended phase II dose of E7820 is 100 mg/d, based on a fasting schedule. E7820 downregulates integrin α-2 expression in surrogate tissues (platelets) and is associated with stable disease in a wide variety of heavily pretreated malignancies.
