The liver is the main metabolic organ of the body and is strongly associated with lifestyle-related diseases in which abnormal metabolism of glucose and lipid are the main manifestations. Recently, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), has been increasing due to a higher rates of obesity. It has been reported that the presence of NAFLD/NASH and associated liver dysfunction are predictors for cardiovascular disease. In addition, attention has been paid to the link between chronic hepatitis C and lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity and insulin resistance. Atherosclerosis is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is associated with lifestyle-related diseases. Thus, chronic liver disease seems to be strongly associated with atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular disease induced by atherosclerosis should be attended to along with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and medications for lifestyle-related diseases are needed in patients with chronic liver disease.
