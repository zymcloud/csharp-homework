Background:To retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a multi-pin bipolar system.Methods:Between August 2005 and December 2006, 18 patients with 30 HCCs (3.40 Â± 1.24 cm, range 1.30-6.0 cm; median number of treated lesions is two per patient, range, 1-3) underwent percutaneous RFA with a multi-pin bipolar system under ultrasound guidance. The primary end-point were treatment efficacy, major and minor complications, and the secondary end-point were overall survival and tumor-free survival.Results:Complete ablation with conformed shape to the index tumor was achieved in 16 of 18 patients, and 28 of the 30 tumors were completely ablated. On follow-up, local and distant intrahepatic tumor progression rates were 12.5% (2 of 16 patients) and 62.5% (10 of 16 patients). There was no patient who developed extrahepatic metastasis. There were no major complications. The 1-, 2-year overall survival rates for all patients were 83.3%, 55.6%, respectively, and the corresponding tumor-free survivals were 50.0%, 22.2%, respectively.Conclusion:RFA with a multi-pin bipolar system was effective and safe for HCC. A large ablation volume could be achieved which conformed to the shape of the index tumor.
