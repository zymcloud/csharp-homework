Although tumor transmission through liver transplantation (LT) is a rare occurrence, the consequences can be devastating, even when a very aggressive management approach is adopted. We report the case of a donor-derived small cell neuroendocrine tumor (NET) in a patient who underwent LT for cholangiocarcinoma. Despite locoregional therapy, chemotherapy and ultimately retransplantation, the patient died from metastases. The high grade nature of the NET was the most important determinant of prognosis in this case. Our experience suggests that retransplantation for donor-derived NET should only be considered when tumor biology is favorable.
