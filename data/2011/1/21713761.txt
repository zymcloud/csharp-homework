Background:The so-called factor that binds to inducer of short transcripts-1 (FBI-1) purportedly plays an important role in tumorigenesis; however, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression level, clinical relevance, and biologic function of FBI-1 in HCC.Methods:Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect expression levels of FBI-1 and to analyze its relation to clinicopathologic parameters and to the prognosis of patients with HCC. In addition, the biologic functions of FBI-1 in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and reaction to chemotherapy were detected by using HepG2 cells and SMMC-7721 cells; subsequently, the molecular mechanism of FBI-1 also was investigated. Finally, a xenograft mouse model was used to validate the observations obtained from in vitro studies.Results:Expression levels of FBI-1 messenger RNA and protein were elevated significantly in HCC tissues compared with adjacent nontumorous liver tissues (ANLTs). Increased FBI-1 expression was correlated with multiple tumor nodes, Edmondson-Steiner grade, and a poor prognosis in patients with HCC (P Conclusions:The current findings indicated that FBI-1 plays an important role in HCC carcinogenesis and chemotherapy tolerance, and FBI-1 may served as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC.
