The life expectancy of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased in the last few years due to recent treatment advances. However, extrahepatic metastases from tumors, previously described only occasionally, are becoming more frequent in clinical practice. The choice between an active or passive approach to these metastatic lesions can sometimes present clinicians with a difficult dilemma. We discuss the case of a male patient with multifocal HCC and cranial metastasis from a primary liver tumor and who, after surgery and radiotherapy over the metastatic lesion, has survived for more than 3 years.
