PET with [methyl-(11)C]-choline (11C-choline) can be useful for detecting well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is not 18F-FDG-avid. This study was designed to examine the relationship between choline metabolism and choline tracer uptake in HCC for PET with 11C-choline.Methods:Dynamic PET scans of 11C-choline were acquired using the woodchuck models of HCC. After imaging, [methyl-(14)C]-choline was injected, and metabolites from both HCC tissue samples and the surrounding hepatic tissues were extracted and analyzed by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. The enzymatic activities of choline kinase and choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase were assayed for correlation with the imaging and metabolism data.Results:PET with 11C-choline showed an HCC detection rate of 9 of 10. The tumor-to-liver ratio for the 9 detected HCCs was 1.89Â±0.55. Hematoxylin-eosin staining confirmed that all spots with high tracer uptake were well-differentiated HCCs. Variation of radioactivity distribution within HCCs indicated a heterogeneous uptake of choline. The activities of both choline kinase and choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase were found to be significantly higher in HCC than in the surrounding hepatic tissues. The major metabolites of 11C-choline were phosphocholine in HCC and betaine and choline in the surrounding hepatic tissues at 12 min after injection; in HCC, phosphocholine rapidly converted to phosphatidylcholine at 30 min after injection.Conclusion:HCCs display enhanced uptake of radiolabeled choline despite a moderate degree of physiologic uptake in the surrounding hepatic tissues. Initially, increased radiolabeled choline uptake in HCCs is associated with the transport and phosphorylation of choline; as time passes, the increased uptake of radiolabeled choline reflects increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis derived from radiolabeled cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) in HCCs. In contrast, the surrounding hepatic tissues exhibit extensive oxidation of radiolabeled choline via the phosphatidylethanolamine methylation pathway, a major contributor to the observed physiologic uptake.
