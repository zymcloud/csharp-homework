Osteopontin (OPN) has close relationship with metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma but its downstream signal pathways have not been well defined in hepatocellular carcinoma. The object of this study is to identify the associated signal pathways in human HCC tissues. The expressions of OPN, intergrin aV, CD44v6, P-FAK, FAK, P-Src, Src, P-ERK and P-AKT were assayed using TMA analysis. The relationship of OPN with P-ERK, P-Src and P-AKT were explored and the role in HCC metastasis was analysed. The expression levels of OPN, intergrin aV, CD44v6, P-FAK, P-Src, Src, P-ERK and P-AKT in HCC tissue were significantly higher than that in normal tissue (P value is less than 0.05). No significant difference was found between the expression levels of FAK in HCC tissue and normal tissue (P value is more than 0.05). OPN expression was significantly associated with Integrin av (P value is less than 0.01), CD44V6 (P value is less than 0.01) and P-ERK (P value is less than 0.05) but not with P-Src, P-FAK and P-AKT (P value is more than 0.05). The expressions of P-FAK (P value is less than 0.05), P-Src (P value is less than 0.01) and P-AKT (P value is less than 0.05) were significantly associated with Integrin av and the P-FAK expression was also significantly associated with CD44V6 (P value is less than 0.01). OPN promotes HCC metastasis though Integrin av/CD44V6/MAPK pathway in human HCC.
