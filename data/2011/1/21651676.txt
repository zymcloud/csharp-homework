The topic of this monograph is liver cancer associated with chronic HCV infection. We start with some background information on chronic HCV infection and its long-term sequelae, one of which is liver cancer. The rest of the article is concerned with liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Epidemiology, risk factors, treatment and outcomes are discussed. We focus on those aspects that are of specific interest in people with haemophilia: studies performed in haemophilia populations, the use of invasive diagnostic and therapeutic tools and the outcome of liver transplantation. Throughout the paper, recommendations are given on surveillance for and diagnosis of HCC and on the practical aspects of invasive procedures. These recommendations are based on professional guidelines, other published evidence and the authors' experience. In general, diagnostic and therapeutic options are the same in persons with and without haemophilia.
