Background & aims:Patients with cirrhosis and small hepatocellular carcinoma with normal bilirubin and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) 70% 5-year survival after hepatic resection. On the contrary, patients with HVPG ≥10 mm Hg (clinically significant portal hypertension, CSPH) frequently develop decompensation following surgery, with around 50% 5-year survival. Liver stiffness (LS) evaluation by transient elastography might non-invasively identify CSPH. We investigated the usefulness of LS predicting CSPH in patients with compensated cirrhosis and potentially resectable liver tumors.Methods:Ninety-seven consecutive Child-Pugh A patients with potentially resectable liver tumors referred for HVPG measurement were prospectively evaluated. In fasting conditions LS was measured before the hemodynamic study.Results:HVPG could be measured in all patients, whereas LS could not be measured in 18 (18.5%) obese patients. In the 79 patients with valid LS, 32 (40.5%) had CSPH; mean HVPG was 8.8±4.7 mm Hg. Mean LS was 18.4±12.3 kPa. LS showed a moderate correlation with HVPG (r=0.552; p21 kPa had low sensitivity (53%) and high specificity (91%) predicting CSPH. 35% of patients had LS between 13.6 and 21 kPa ("grey zone").Conclusions:These data suggest that in real-life scenarios half of patients with potentially resectable liver nodules can be non-invasively classified as having or not CSPH by LS. However, in the remaining half, LS is either not applicable or inaccurate. In this last population HVPG is still a non replaceable method to detect CSPH.
