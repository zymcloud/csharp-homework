Shikonin, a major component of Lithospermum erythrorhizon and Arnebia euchroma, exhibits antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory and antitumour activities. Although many recent studies have focused on the antitumour effects of shikonin, the exact mechanisms underlying its antitumour and immunomodulatory effects in tumour-bearing mice remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antitumour and immunomodulatory effects of shikonin derivatives (ShD) in tumour-bearing mice. Swiss mice inoculated with hepatoma HepA(22) or sarcoma 180 (S(180)) cells were treated with ShD or 5-fluorouracil (5Fu). Survival time, immune organs, natural killer cell activity, lymphocytes, lymphocyte transformation and interleukin (IL)-2 production were analysed. ShD significantly prolonged the survival (median survival time prolonged by >7 days) of tumour-bearing mice in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited the growth of transplantable neoplasms (inhibitory rate, > 33%), and recovered (at [ShD] = 2.5 mg/kg/day) or increased (at [ShD] > 5 mg/kg/day) the number of CD3- and CD19-positive cells. ShD also played a role in protecting the immune organs from damage and reversed or enhanced immune responses, as noted by the nearly normal thymic structure; enlarged splenic corpuscles; and improved natural killer cell activity, lymphocyte transformation and IL-2 production in ShD-treated mice. ShD reduced the tumour load of tumour-bearing mice and protected the immune organs against tumour-induced damage and immune function impairment.
