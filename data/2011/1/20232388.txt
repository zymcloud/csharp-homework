A subadditive effect of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is possible because superinfection of one virus tends to inhibit infection of the other virus. However, studies have reported inconsistent findings, and two meta-analyses of studies from various countries (1998) and China (2005) reported a supraadditive effect for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. Thus, we reevaluate HBV/HCV monoinfection and coinfection. Of 411 reports, we included 59 studies that assessed the association between HBV/HCV monoinfection and coinfection for HCC risk. HCC risk because of high/detectable HBV DNA and HBeAg infection was higher than HBsAg infection, whereas anti-HCV vs anti-HCV/HCV RNA was not different. Geographically, HCC risk was significantly higher in nonendemic than in HBV or HCV endemic areas. Subadditive effect for HCC risk was presented in recently published studies, cohort studies and studies conducted in HBV/HCV nonendemic areas; an additive effect was presented in studies conducted in HBV endemic areas; a supraadditive effect was presented in previously published studies, case-control studies and studies conducted in HCV endemic areas. Our results suggest HBV/HCV coinfection for HCC risk is not significantly greater than HBV/HCV monoinfection, and HCC risk due to HBV or HCV is higher in nonendemic than endemic areas. The p-heterogeneity was significant for most analyses, except HBV(+)/HCV(+) and HBV biomarker analyses. Prevention strategies targeted toward HBV or HCV monoinfected patients are needed. In addition, tailored prevention to reduce infectivity such as HBV markers (HBeAg, HBV DNA) is needed.
