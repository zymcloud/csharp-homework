The antitumor effects and molecular mechanism of NPC-16, a novel naphthalimide-polyamine conjugate, were evaluated in HepG2 cells and Bel-7402 cells. Apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated by Annexin V-FITC detection kit, and autophagy by acridine orange and Lyso-Tracker Red staining. The change of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was measured using rhodamine 123 staining. The protein expression of Beclin 1, LC3 II and mTOR, p70S6 K, 14-3-3, caspase, and Bcl-2 family members was detected by immunofluorescence assays and Western Blot. Here, we elucidated the nature of cellular response of HepG2 cells and Bel-7402 cells to NPC-16 at IC(50). NPC-16 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway and death receptor pathway in Bel-7402 cells. Differently, NPC-16 triggered HepG2 cells both apoptosis and autophagy, further autophagy facilitated cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, mTOR signal pathway was involved in NPC-16-mediated autophagy in HepG2 cells. Thus, NPC-16 may be useful as a potential template for investigation the molecular mechanism of naphthalimide-polyamine conjugate against hepatocellular carcinoma.
