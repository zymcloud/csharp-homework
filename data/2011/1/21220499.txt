The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) has emerged as a pivotal event in the development of the invasive and metastatic potentials of cancer progression. Sorafenib, a VEGFR inhibitor with activity against RAF kinase, is active against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the possible involvement of sorafenib in the EMT remains unclear. Here, we examined the effect of sorafenib on the EMT. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induced EMT-like morphologic changes and the upregulation of SNAI1 and N-cadherin expression. The downregulation of E-cadherin expression in HepG2 and Huh7 HCC cell lines shows that HGF mediates the EMT in HCC. The knockdown of SNAI1 using siRNA canceled the HGF-mediated morphologic changes and cadherin switching, indicating that SNAI1 is required for the HGF-mediated EMT in HCC. Interestingly, sorafenib and the MEK inhibitor U0126 markedly inhibited the HGF-induced morphologic changes, SNAI1 upregulation, and cadherin switching, whereas the PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin did not. Collectively, these findings indicate that sorafenib downregulates SNAI1 expression by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, thereby inhibiting the EMT in HCC cells. In fact, a wound healing and migration assay revealed that sorafenib completely canceled the HGF-mediated cellular migration in HCC cells. In conclusion, we found that sorafenib exerts a potent inhibitory activity against the EMT by inhibiting MAPK signaling and SNAI1 expression in HCC. Our findings may provide a novel insight into the anti-EMT effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer cells.
