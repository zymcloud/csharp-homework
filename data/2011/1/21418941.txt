Objective:To assess the reliability and usefulness of the extended supraclavicular fasciocutaneous island flap (eSIF) for reconstructing soft tissue defects followinng tongue cancer ablation.Methods:Twenty-two tongue defects in 22 patients with tongue cancer were repaired with eSIF after resection of the tongue malignant tumours. The sizes of the skin paddle ranged from (4 cm × 6 cm) to (8 cm × 14 cm) (average: 5.5 cm × 8.7 cm).Results:The eSIF survived in twenty cases, including two cases with minimal partial necrosis. The patients were follwed up for 5 - 16 months. Eighteen patients were alive with disease free, two were alive with disease and two died of a lung and liver metastasis.Conclusions:The eSIF is reliable for reconstructing oral defects following the ablation of advanced oral malignant tumors.
