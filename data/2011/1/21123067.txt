Three perglycosylated nordihydroguaiaretic acids (NDGA) were synthesized through the Huiseng 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. These sugar-NDGA conjugates containing triazole-linkages possessed good solubility in water. NDGA-(triazol-galactose)(4) (12b) and NDGA-(triazol-glucose)(4) (12c) were found to act as inhibitors against human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells in culture.
