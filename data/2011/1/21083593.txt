Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the first cause of liver transplantation worldwide. Recurrence of infection is constant, and compromises patient and graft survival.Aim:To provide an updated review of the main treatments of recurrent HCV.Methods:MEDLINE (1990 to August 2010) and national meeting abstract search. Search terms included hepatitis C, liver transplantation, treatment, sustained virological response. An emphasis was placed on randomised trials.Results:Anti-viral therapy based on pegylated interferon and ribavirin must be considered before liver transplantation, but is poorly tolerated and has poor results in patients with cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-viral therapy can be administrated systematically early after liver transplantation, or in patients with established recurrent chronic hepatitis. Combination of pegylated interferon alpha plus ribavirin results in a sustained virological response of up to 30% in patients with histological HCV recurrence. The results of a small trial of polyclonal anti-HCV to prevent recurrence were disappointing.Conclusions:Currently available anti-viral therapy is effective only in a minority of transplanted patients infected with HCV. Specifically targeted anti-viral therapies combining interferon alpha and ribavirin, or a combination of antiprotease and antipolymerase components, associated with a genetic prediction of anti-viral response and blocking HCV cell entry should improve the long-term prognosis of recurrent hepatitis C in the near future.
