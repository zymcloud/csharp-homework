Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major risk factor for chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Once robust cell culture systems for production of recombinant infectious HCV became available, evidence on molecular mechanisms underlying assembly and release of the virus particles began to accumulate. Recent studies have demonstrated that lipid droplets and viral nonstructural proteins play key roles in HCV morphogenesis. This review considers the current knowledge about maturation of HCV structural proteins and production of viral infectious particles.
