A 78-year-old male who experienced multiple recurrences of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and ablation and survived for more than 10 years. His serum HCV RNA level was 2.8 log IU/ml and the serotype of HCV was 2. He underwent long-term super-low-dose (20 Î¼g/week) pegylated interferon-alpha 2b therapy to prevent recurrence of HCC. He became negative for HCV RNA 2 months later, and thereafter remained negative after the discontinuation of interferon therapy, and has not experienced a recurrence of HCC for more than 20 months.
