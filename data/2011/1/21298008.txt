Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is difficult to manage due to the high frequency of post-surgical recurrence. Early detection of the HCC recurrence after liver resection is important in making further therapeutic options, such as salvage liver transplantation. In this study, we utilized microRNA expression profiling to assess the risk of HCC recurrence after liver resection.Methods:We examined microRNA expression profiling in paired tumor and non-tumor liver tissues from 73 HCC patients who satisfied the Milan Criteria. We constructed prediction models of recurrence-free survival using the Cox proportional hazard model and principal component analysis. The prediction efficiency was assessed by the leave-one-out cross-validation method, and the time-averaged area under the ROC curve (ta-AUROC).Results:The univariate Cox analysis identified 13 and 56 recurrence-related microRNAs in the tumor and non-tumor tissues, such as miR-96. The number of recurrence-related microRNAs was significantly larger in the non-tumor-derived microRNAs (N-miRs) than in the tumor-derived microRNAs (T-miRs, PConclusion:MicroRNA profiling can predict HCC recurrence in Milan criteria cases.
