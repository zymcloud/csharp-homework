Background:Telomerase plays an important role in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis and is believed to be a good target for anti-cancer drugs. Elimination of template function of telomerase RNA may repress the telomerase activity.Methods:A pseudo-knotted HDV ribozyme (g.RZ57) directed against the RNA component of human telomerase (hTR) was designed and synthesized. An in vitro transcription plasmid and a eukaryotic expression plasmid of ribozyme were constructed. The eukaryotic expression plasmid was induced into heptocellular carcinoma 7402 cells, colon cancer HCT116 cells and L02 hepatocytes respectively. Then we determine the cleavage activity of ribozyme against human telomerase RNA component (hTR) both in vitro and in vivo, and detect telomerase activity continuously.Results:HDV ribozyme showed a specific cleavage activity against the telomerase RNA in vitro. The maximum cleavage ratio reached about 70.4%. Transfection of HDV ribozyme into 7402 cells and colon cancer cells HCT116 led to growth arrest and the spontaneous apoptosis of cells, and the telomerase activity dropped to 10% of that before.Conclusion:HDV ribozyme (g.RZ57) is an effective strategy for gene therapy.
