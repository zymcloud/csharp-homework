Purpose:This study was performed to elucidate whether evaluating the liver surface, edge, and texture by high-resolution ultrasonography is useful for predicting the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated chronic liver diseases (CLDs)Methods:The integrated fibrosis stage (a comprehensive value of scores for liver edge, surface, and texture) of 337 patients with HCV-associated CLDs was evaluated, at entry, by ultrasonography (US), as a US score. The patients were followed up prospectively (mean observation period was 16.4 months; range 2.8-36.2 months) for the occurrence of HCC by US or helical CT at 3-month intervals. A total of 140 patients received interferon therapy, and the occurrence of HCC was compared between those with and without interferon therapyResults:The annual incidence of HCC was 1.1, 5.5, and 10.2% in low, middle, and high US score groups, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that age, serum levels of total bilirubin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), platelet count, albumin, total cholesterol, and the US score were associated with HCC occurrence in the patients. A multivariate proportional hazard model revealed that only the middle and high US scores (p = 0.0922, hazard ratio 4.006, 95% CI 0.796-20.153 and p = 0.008, hazard ratio 7.991, 95% CI 1.721-37.10, respectively) and elevated AFP (p = 0.031, hazard ratio 2.774, CI 1.097-7.014) were independently associated with HCC occurrence. Our US scoring based on evaluation of the liver surface, edge, and texture was clearly and strongly associated with the occurrence of HCC in patients with HCV-associated CLDs, and with the higher occurrence rate of HCC in patients with higher US scoresConclusion:Thus, US is a good tool for evaluating the fibrosis stage of the liver, and may therefore be useful in designing an optimum follow-up interval for each patient with HCV-associated CLD.
