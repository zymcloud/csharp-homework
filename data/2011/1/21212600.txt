The patient was a terminally ill 80-year-old man with multiple lung metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma, that had developed following hepatitis-C virus-associated cirrhosis. He was admitted to our hospital with gingival bleeding, and we diagnosed gingival metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma, based on histological examination. The bleeding could not be controlled, and the patient became dyspneic. After transcatheter arterial embolization, his bleeding was successfully controlled until his death due to respiratory failure. Transcatheter arterial embolization was a safe and effective treatment in our case.
