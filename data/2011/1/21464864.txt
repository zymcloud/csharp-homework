Background:Therapy with drug-eluting microspheres was recently introduced with an aim to decrease the high postoperative morbidity associated with chemoembolization with lipiodol. The purpose of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of chemoembolization with doxorubicin-eluting microspheres (DEB-TACE) for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods:In this IRB-approved retrospective study, 54 patients (44 men; median age, 61 years) with inoperable HCC were treated with DEB-TACE. HCC was diagnosed by biopsy in 43 and with a combination of α-fetoprotein (AFP) and imaging in 11. Patients with Child-Pugh A, B, C cirrhosis were 27, 25, 2, respectively. Twenty-one patients had received local therapies prior to DEB-TACE. Tumor was multifocal in 30. Eight patients had branch portal vein thrombosis. DEB-TACE was performed using 300-500μ LC Beads™ mixed with 100 mg of doxorubicin. Twenty-two patients had one DEB-TACE procedure, 23 patients had 2, 8 patients had 3, and 1 had four procedures. Response rate (RR) was assessed using AFP, RECIST, and EASL criteria on CT/MRI at 1 and 3 months. Overall median survival and survival rates at 6, 12, and 24 months were calculated.Results:DEB-TACE was technically successful in all. Mean hospital stay after the procedure was 1.59 days. Thirty-day mortality was 0%. RR based on AFP was 26%. At 1 and 3 months, CR + PR were 14.8% and 35%, SD 74.1% and 50%, and PD 11.1% and 15%. Overall median survival was 445 days (95% CI 312-590). The survival rates at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years were 77%, 59%, and 32% respectively.Conclusions:Chemoembolization with doxorubicin-eluting microspheres is safe and well tolerated in patients with inoperable HCC. Its efficacy is comparable to the historical controls. However, further prospective studies are required to confirm its efficacy.
