Background/purpose:We aimed to correlate the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with macroscopic portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) who underwent partial hepatectomy with or without portal thrombectomy with our PVTT classification. Currently, different staging systems for HCC are widely used in clinical practice. However, they lack the refinement in giving prognosis and guiding surgical treatment once macroscopic PVTT is present.Methods:A retrospective study was carried out, in a single tertiary center, from January 2001 to December 2004 on 441 patients who underwent partial hepatectomy with or without portal thrombectomy for HCC with macroscopic PVTT. Overall survival was examined to determine whether it was correlated with our PVTT classification, and with the TNM staging, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) scoring system, and the Japan Integrated Staging (JIS) scoring system.Results:With our PVTT classification, the numbers (percentages) of patients with types I, II, III, and IV PVTT were 144 (32.7%), 189 (42.9%), 86 (19.5%), and 22 (5.0%), respectively. The corresponding 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates for types I to IV PVTT were 54.8, 33.9, and 26.7%; 36.4, 24.9, and 16.9%; 25.9, 12.9, and 3.7%; and 11.1, 0, and 0%, respectively (log-rank of the survival curves P Conclusions:In patients with HCC with macroscopic PVTT treated by partial hepatectomy with or without thrombectomy, our PVTT classification better stratified and predicted prognosis than the TNM staging, CLIP scoring system, and JIS scoring system, which were unrefined and inadequate for this group of patients.
