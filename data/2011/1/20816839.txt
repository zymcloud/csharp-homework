Background & aims:Human liver-related putative tumor suppressor (LPTS) is a gene that encodes a telomerase inhibitory protein that is similar to human Pin2/TRF1-interacting protein. The LPTS protein binds directly to the telomerase catalytic subunit (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) and suppresses telomerase activity. Telomere maintenance and telomerase activity are required for long-term proliferation of cancer cells, so LPTS might be used in anticancer strategies.Methods:The carboxy-terminal (functional) fragment of LPTS was fused to the transactivator of transcription of human immunodeficiency virus (Tat)-an 11-amino acid peptide that translocates across the cell membrane; the TAT-fused C-terminal of LPTS (TAT-LPTS-LC) was purified and transduced into cells. Telomerase activity was identified by using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol. The effects of the TAT-LPTS-LC protein on cell proliferation and death were evaluated by colorimetric tetrazolium salt and flow cytometry analyses. Tumor growth was analyzed in nude mice.Results:The purified TAT-LPTS-LC protein was efficiently delivered into the cells, where it suppressed telomerase activity and shortened telomere length. TAT-LPTS-LC inhibited proliferation of telomerase-positive hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7404 and hepatoblastoma HepG2cells and induced their death; however, it had no effect on telomerase-negative liver cell line L02 and osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2. In mice, tumor formations by BEL-7404 cells were suppressed by TAT-LPTS-LC treatments.Conclusions:Transduction of hepatoma cells with a fusion protein that contains the C-terminal, functional fragment of LPTS and human immunodeficiency virus Tat (TAT-LPTS-LC) causes telomere shortening, limits proliferation, and inhibits growth of tumors from these cells in mice. TAT-LPTS-LC inhibits telomerase activity and might be developed as an anticancer agent.
