Background and aims:Annexin A10 (ANXA10) and its liver-specific short isoform (ANXA10S) had tissue-restricted expression. The downregulation of ANXA10S is correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to validate the tissue distribution and explore the role of the ANXA10 protein expression in gastric carcinoma.Methods:We examined the ANXA10 protein expression in human and animal tissues and 356 resected primary gastric carcinomas, using specific mouse and rabbit polyclonal antibodies, by immunohistochemical staining.Results:The ANXA10 protein is a nuclear protein specifically expressed in fetal and adult gastric mucosa and Brunner's gland across species, including humans, minipigs, woodchucks, and mice, and is commonly lost in gastric mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. The ANXA10 protein was expressed in 43.5% (155 cases) of gastric carcinomas; 74.2% (98/132) in the diffuse-type gastric carcinoma (DGC), 73.7% (28/38) in the mixed-type gastric carcinoma, and significantly lower in the intestinal-type gastric carcinoma (IGC) and indeterminate groups, 16.8% (28/167) and 5.3% (1/19), respectively (PConclusions:The ANXA10 protein expression is a novel marker of gastric differentiation, and is differentially expressed in IGC and DGC, with opposite prognostic significance.
