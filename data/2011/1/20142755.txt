Goal:In this study, we attempted to evaluate the prognosis of combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) with comparison to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CC).Background:The prognosis of cHCC-CC has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the prognosis of cHCC-CC with comparison to HCC and CC.Study:Consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for cHCC-CC at a single tertiary care center in Korea and their age, sex, and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class matched HCC and CC patients were included. We evaluated time-to-recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS) of cHCC-CC cases and compared them with HCC and CC patients.Results:Thirty cHCC-CC, 60 HCC, and 60 CC patients were included. For cHCC-CC group, the median TTR and OS were 5.4 and 18.0 months. After adjustment for confounding factors, the cHCC-CC group had a shorter TTR than did HCC group [relative risk (RR), 2.76; PConclusions:The results of this study indicated that cHCC-CC had a significantly poorer prognosis than HCC and CC even after curative resection.
