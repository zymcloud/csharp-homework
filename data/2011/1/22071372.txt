Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) is the terminal degradation product of many commercially used perfluorinated compounds, and most of the toxicity testing to date has focused on its potential biological effects. While PFOS has been extensively studied, other PFCs including replacement chemicals such as perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS) and perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA), have not been well characterized. Despite the relative lack of data available on these other PFCs it has been assumed that they will cause similar or lesser effects than PFOS. This study compared the effects of 10 PFCs routinely found in the environment on mRNA abundance of 7 genes related to processes known to be affected by PFOS, such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, and thyroid development. Rat H4IIE hepatoma cells were exposed and changes in mRNA abundance were quantified by real-time PCR. Significant changes in mRNA abundance were observed. The effects caused by the shorter chain replacement chemicals differed significantly from those caused by PFOS or PFOA. Furthermore, not all of the PFCs caused the same effects, and changes could not simply be attributed to chain-length or functional group. These differences could mean that these replacement chemicals do not act through the same mechanisms as the more studied PFOS and PFOA.
