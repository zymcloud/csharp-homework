Background and aim:The aim of the present study was to elucidate a reasonable model and the efficacy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening on an elderly population.Methods:Two-stage HCC screening was conducted in a hepatitis C virus (HCV)-endemic area. First, participants underwent blood tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HCV antibody, serum α-fetoprotein (AFP), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and platelet count. Patients who were abnormal for any of the six markers were enrolled for second-stage ultrasonography. Suspected cases were referred for confirmation. HCC cases were followed for 4 years. All patients were linked to national mortality and cancer register databases to identify newly-developed HCC, 30 months after screening.Results:A total of 461 males and 541 females were screened for HCC, with 15.1% testing positive for HBsAg and 44.3% positive for anti-HCV. Among them, 619 (61.8%) met the criteria of ultrasonographic screening; 527 (85.1%) responded, and 16 confirmed HCC (male/female = 8/8, 68.8±8 years) cases were detected. All tumor diameters were less than 5 cm, and six were less than 2 cm. AFP and thrombocytopenia were two independent predictive factors of HCC. The overall survival rates of detected cases were 93.8% and 56.3% was 1 and 4 years, respectively. The only good prognostic predictor was "underwent curative treatment". Another seven non-HCC residents developed HCC after screening, and five of these were with either thrombocytopenia or AFP elevation.Conclusion:Under economical consideration, AFP and platelet count should be feasible screening markers of risk identification. Early detection and prompt treatment results in good prognosis in an aged population.
