Locoregional therapy (LRT) is used as a bridge to orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Liver explants in OLT patients with HCC were studied regarding both tumor stage, histology, and immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin (CK)7, CK19, P53, Ki-67, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Patients receiving no LRT (control) (n=30) were compared with LRT treatment groups with conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) (n=25) or drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB TACE) (n=17). Tumor stage and histology were similar between treatment and control groups. The mean percent necrosis was significantly higher for treatment groups versus the control group (p
