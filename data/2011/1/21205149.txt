HBsAg is a very important clinical test that might not only indicate active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection but might also be used to predict clinical and treatment outcome. Clearance of HBsAg in patients with chronic HBV infection is associated with a much better clinical outcome, although surveillance for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) should continue. HBV DNA quantification is currently used for selecting candidates for therapy, monitoring response to therapy and detecting the emergence of drug resistance. Assays for HBsAg quantification are less expensive than HBV DNA and fully automated with a high throughput capacity. HBsAg titering may be a useful tool to manage patients with chronic HBV, to more clearly define which patients may, and more importantly, may not, benefit from treatment. Baseline and on-treatment HBsAg quantification may help to refine future treatment algorithms for both immune-modulator therapy and nucleos(t)ide analogues. Both HBV markers provide complementary information on the status of HBV infection. However, the relevance of serum HBsAg levels and its use as a reliable replacement for both covalently closed circular DNA and HBV DNA remain unclear.
