Objective:We retrospectively evaluated the antitumor effect, survival and toxicities of hepatic arterial infusion therapy using a fine powder formulation of cisplatin (cisplatin powder) in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis.Methods:Twenty-four patients classified as Child-Pugh class A or B underwent a single session of hepatic arterial infusion therapy using cisplatin powder. The treatment was repeated every 4-6 weeks in patients with no evidence of tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The treatment response was evaluated using contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed 1 month after each treatment. The survival rate was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and predictors of a better outcome were identified using univariate analysis.Results:The mean follow-up period was 11.2 months (range, 1.3-44.2 months). A total of 57 sessions of intra-arterial infusion (1-6 sessions per patient; mean, 2.4 sessions) with cisplatin powder were performed. A complete response and a partial response were obtained in one and four patients, respectively (objective response rate = 20.8%). The median survival time for all the patients was 7.0 months; the median survival times for the 5 responders and 19 non-responders were 37.3 and 5.6 months, respectively. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 38% and 16%, respectively. Significant prognostic factors related to survival were the therapeutic effect, patient age and serum alanine aminotransferase level. Severe adverse reactions resulting in treatment discontinuation were not observed, and all the toxicities were successfully managed using conservative treatment.Conclusions:Hepatic arterial infusion therapy with a fine powder formulation of cisplatin was safe, well-tolerated and might help to prolong the life span of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis.
