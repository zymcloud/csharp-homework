Objective:To explore the utility of multidisciplinary approaches in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer with liver metastases (PCLM).Methods:From 2002 to 2007, a total of 164 consecutive patients with PCLM treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or Chinese herbal medicine were included in this study. Clinical parameters, treatments received, and survival time from initial diagnosis were analyzed.Results:Of the 164 patients, 113 (69%) were men and 51 (31%) were women, with median age of 58 years. One hundred thirty-two patients (80%) had synchronous liver metastases, and 57 patients (35%) had extrahepatic metastases. Overall median survival time of the 164 patients was 4.7 months; 23 (14%) were alive at least 12 months after initial diagnosis of liver metastases. Karnofsky performance status of less than 80, weight loss (>10% within 6 months), ascites, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 of 1000 U/mL or greater were the most relevant predictors of poor survival. Multivariate analysis showed that chemotherapy and Chinese herbal medicine were protective factors.Conclusions:Multimodality treatment is well tolerated by patients with PCLM and may be effective in prolonging their survival. Awareness of the implications of these prognostic factors may assist in evaluating the survival potential of patients and selecting the most appropriate treatments.
