Purpose:Diaphragmatic involvement is relatively uncommon in patients undergoing a hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term surgical impacts of HCC with gross diaphragmatic involvement in patients undergoing an en bloc resection of the diaphragm.Methods:Between 1990 and 2007, 911 patients with HCC underwent a hepatectomy at our institution. Twenty-seven patients (3.0%) had had gross involvement of the diaphragm. Thirteen patients (1.4%) had undergone an en bloc resection of the diaphragm, and 14 (1.5%) had received only a blunt dissection. The short-term surgical impacts (surgical morbidity and mortality) and long-term surgical impacts (overall and disease-free survival) were compared between the groups.Results:In patients with an en bloc resection of the diaphragm as compared with those who received a blunt dissection, the values of total bilirubin and the indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min were significantly better (P Conclusion:An en bloc resection of the diaphragm in patients with gross diaphragmatic involvement of HCC is therefore justified, since there are no significant differences in short- or long-term surgical impacts in comparison with the patients receiving blunt dissection.
