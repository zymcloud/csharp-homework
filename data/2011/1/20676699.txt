Background/purpose:This study aimed to clarify the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) after hepatectomy.Methods:The database records of three hundred and eight patients who underwent elective surgical treatment for hepatolithiasis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and metastatic carcinoma were retrospectively analyzed to determine the occurrence of postoperative infectious complications. The incidences of SSIs, classified as superficial or deep incisional SSIs and organ or space SSIs, and all other infectious complications within 30 days after hepatectomy were evaluated.Results:The incidences of SSIs after a hepatectomy for hepatolithiasis (23.8%) were higher than those after a hepatectomy for HCC (11.3%) (p = 0.034) and after a hepatectomy for metastatic carcinoma (2.7%) (p Conclusions:Our study suggests the existence of a relationship between postoperative SSIs and bile infection, thus supporting the proposed relationship between post-hepatectomy infection and such variables as liver function, blood sugar control, and nutritional status.
