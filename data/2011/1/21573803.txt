The ribosome assembly factor NIN/RPN12 binding protein (Nob1) has been suggested to be essential for processing of the 20S pre-rRNA to the mature 18S rRNA, and is also reported to participate in proteasome biogenesis. However, it is unclear whether Nob1 is involved in tumor cells growth. The aim of this study was to determine whether the suppression of Nob1 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibits the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Recombinant lentiviral shRNA expression vector carrying Nob1 was constructed and then infected into human HCC cell line SMMC-7721. The growth properties of SMMC-7721/pGCSIL-GFP-shNC and pGCSIL-GFP-shNob1 cells were determined by MTT, BrdU incorporation assay, and flow cytometric analysis. In addition, the colony formation and tumor growth ability in nude mice were detected to define the function of Nob1 in cell transformation and tumorigenesis. Our data showed that the growth and proliferation of SMMC-7721/pGCSIL-GFP-shNob1 cells were significantly reduced compared with the SMMC-7721/pGCSIL-GFP-shNC. In addition, the colony formation was impaired after the suppression of Nob1 in SMMC-7721 cells. And in vivo, the tumor formation ability of the SMMC-7721/pGCSIL-GFP-shNob1 cells was significantly reduced compared with the control cells. Our data support that Nob1 is an important regulator of the tumorigenic properties of human HCC and could be used as a candidate therapeutic target in human HCC.
