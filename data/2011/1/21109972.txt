Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in various cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), chemoresistance has precluded single use of 5-FU in clinical settings. Since menatetrenone, an analogue of vitamin K2 (VK2), inhibits growth of cancer cells including HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, we examined VK2 modulation of HCC cell response to 5-FU. VK2 pretreatment dose-dependently enhanced growth-inhibition by 5-FU through a G1 cell cycle arrest. VK2 inhibited 5-FU-induced NF-ÎºB activation and cyclin D1 expression. Therefore, combination of VK2 and 5-FU might represent a new therapeutic strategy for patients with HCC.
