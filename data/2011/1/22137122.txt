Background:It is well-known that tumor exerts nonmetastatic systemic effect on organism caused the development of paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS). Recent findings point to relationships between development of PNS and tumor-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).Aim:Comparative study of PNS manifestations in mice with transplanted two variants of Lewis lung carcinoma with different angiogenic potential.Methods:Plasma VEGF level was determined by immunoenzyme method, hematological indices were estimated with the use of hematological analyzer, the weight and cellularity of spleen and thymus were registered and histological analysis of tissue section of these organs was performed.Results:Manifestations of anemia, extramedullary hemopoiesis and tumor-associated inflammatory disease was observed in animals with high angiogenic LLC/R9 variant and was not registered in low angiogenic LLC. The emergence of PNS symptoms correlated with elevated level of circulating VEGF at the early stages of LLC/R9 growth.Conclusion:Manifestation of the paraneoplastic hematological syndrome most likely is conditioned on the ability of cancer cell to secrete VEGF in a high rate.
