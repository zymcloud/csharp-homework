Objective:To study the expression and significance of GPC3, CD10 and CD34 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), dysplastic nodules (DN), cirrhotic regenerative nodules (CRN), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and hepatocellular adenoma (HA).Methods:Immunohistochemical study for GPC3, CD10, CD34 and AFP was performed on 80 cases of HCC (30 cases of well-differentiated HCC and 50 cases of advanced HCC), 30 cases of DN (18 cases of high-grade DN and 12 cases of low-grade DN), 36 cases of CRN, 20 cases of FNH and 20 cases of HA.Results:(1) The positive expression rate of GPC3 was 92% (46/50) in advanced HCC, 66.7% (20/30) in well-differentiated HCC, 2/18 in high-grade DN, and 0 in low-grade DN, CRN, FNH and HA. The expression rate of GPC3 in well-differentiated HCC was lower than that in advanced HCC and higher than that in high-grade DN (P Conclusions:GPC3 is a relatively sensitive and specific marker in pathologic diagnosis of HCC. When coupled with immunohistochemical results of CD34, CD10 and AFP, GPC3 is useful in differentiating HCC from DN, LCN, FNH and HA.
