The approval of sorafenib as the standard of care (SOC) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) fostered interest to further evaluate several other targeted therapies and extend the positioning of sorafenib alone and in combination with other drugs and local therapies at earlier stages and in an adjuvant setting. This review highlights current research using targeted therapies in HCC. Information for this review was compiled by searching PubMed and MEDLINE databases for articles published until September 2010. Several small molecules and humanized antibodies with anti-angiogenic and antiproliferative properties are currently being investigated in preclinical and/or clinical trials. Results are awaited from these clinical trials and offer promise for extending the current treatment options in HCC. Currently published data suggest that substantial progress may be achieved in the treatment of patients with HCC in the next 10 years.
