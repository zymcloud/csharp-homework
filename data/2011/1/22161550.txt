Introduction:This retrospective study evaluates the efficacy of palliative chemotherapy with a modified docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; "TPF" regimen) regimen (mTPF; reduced doses of docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU with reduction of intravenous 5-FU from 4 days to 2 days) in Asian patients with recurrent and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC) after surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation.Methods:The mTPF regimen was used in this study. Fifty-five patients (from January 2007 to October 2009) received docetaxel on day 1, followed by cisplatin and 5-FU administered continuous infusion on day 2 for another 48 hours every 3 weeks for three to six cycles.Results:The disease control rate was 81%. The overall response rate was 56%. Five patients achieved complete remission; 26 patients had partial remission; 14 patients had stable disease. Ten patients had disease progression. The metastatic sites that responded well to mTPF regimen (either complete or partial remission) were: neck lymph node, lung, liver, and skin. The median follow-up was 15 months (range 1-28 months). The median overall survival was 10 months (range 2-28 months). The common nonhematological toxicity was alopecia and the most common hematological adverse event was neutropenia. Thirty-one patients (56%) had grade 3-4 neutropenia.Conclusion:The mTPF chemotherapy regimen is efficacious for the palliative treatment of recurrent and metastatic HNSCC in Asian patients.
