Hypothesis:An elevated serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) level before orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) is predictive of mortality after OLT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Design:Retrospective analysis of a population-based cohort.Setting:United Network for Organ Sharing registry (2003-2008).Patients:We identified 2253 patients who underwent OLT for HCC with available pre-OLT serum AFP values.Methods:Patients were stratified by AFP levels into low (Results:Of the 2253 patients, 1210 (53.7%), 805 (35.7%), and 238 (10.6%) were in the low, medium, and high AFP groups, respectively. On univariate analysis, the low AFP group demonstrated the best 4-year survival (76%) compared with the medium (65%; P = .001) and high (57%; P Conclusions:Serum AFP level is an independent prognostic predictor of outcome after OLT for HCC. The association between serum AFP value and post-OLT survival warrants further investigation to potentially better allocate donor allografts for HCC.
