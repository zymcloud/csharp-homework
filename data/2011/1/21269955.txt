Objective:To investigate the effect of hTERT single nucleotide polymorphisms on the development and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A total of 290 male patients were divided into hepatitis-induced primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) group (n%162), metastatic HCC group (n%22), and control group (n%106). hTERT gene was amplified and hTERT single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested in these subjects.Results:Significant differences were found in rs2853690 and rs10069690 distribution, but the difference in rs6554743 remained uncertain. The C and T alleles of rs10069690 and rs6554743 showed significant differences between the 3 groups; the carriers of non-T allele of rs10069690 had higher frequencies in both primary and metastatic HCC groups.Conclusion:Some of the polymorphisms of hTERT may increase the risks of development and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
