Persistent oxidative stress has been associated with carcinogenesis. Iron overload is considered one such condition that causes oxidative stress. Epidemiological studies support a close link between iron overload and carcinogenesis. Reportedly, regular semiannual phlebotomies reduced cancer risk in an otherwise normal population. More specifically, genetic hemochromatosis, chronic viral hepatitis, ovarian endometriosis and asbestosis induce iron overload, which can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma or mesothelioma in humans. Through a combination of animal experiments and microarray analyses, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/2B has been recognized as one of the major target genes involved in iron overload-induced carcinogenesis. CDKN2A/2B are the second most frequently inactivated tumor suppressing genes in human cancers. Currently, when infection is becoming sufficiently controlled worldwide, iron regulation may be the next target for human longevity.
