Cerebralmetastases from primary cervical carcinomas are very rare with a repeated incidence of 0. 5-1. 2% in various studies. A 46-year-old woman was initially diagnosed and treated for FIGO clinical stage II a cervical carcinoma. She was two gravid, two para. When 40 years old, she had a right hemicolectomy and chemotherapy, due to colon cancer. Her mother also had colon cancer, cervical cancer, and stomach cancer. She had habitually smoked ten/day for 26 years. First, she went to the outpatient clinic, due to abnormal vaginal bleeding. She had a biopsy of her cervix and was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She underwent a radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Pathological diagnosis was adenosquamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix with extensive LVSI and pelvic lymph node metastasis (right internalil iac LN), myometrial invasion (depth 10 mm), anterior vaginal wall metastasis, but no metastasis of vaginal stump. She came to our hospital for radiotherapy. The woman received concurrent chemoradiotherapy(CCRT)with weekly CDDP 30 mg/mÂ² as adjuvant therapy. Shortly after CCRT, she was diagnosed with multiple metastases to the bone, liver, lung, and brain. She received palliative radiotherapy and eventually died four months after being diagnosed. The extremely rapid progression of this patient's disease is unusual. To our knowledge, this is one of the most aggressive cases of cervical adenosquamous cell carcinoma documented.
