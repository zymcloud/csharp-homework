Objective:To explore the relationship between the single-nucleotide polymorphism of DNA repair gene hOGG1 and the susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the interaction between hOGG1 and environmental risk factors in a hepatocarcinoma high risk area.Method:This hospital-based case control study was conducted in 500 HCC patients and 507 controls. The polymorphism of hOGG1-Ser326Cys was genotyped by a real time polymerase chain reaction-TaqMan MGB.Results:The allele mutation frequencies of hOGG1-326Cys in the case group and control group were 24.60% and 10.75% respectively (P Conclusion:The hOGG1-326Cys allele may contribute to the risk of HCC. The synergistic interaction between hOGG1-326Cys allele and chronic HBV infection might modify the risk of HCC. Further studies with larger sample size are warranted to confirm these findings.
