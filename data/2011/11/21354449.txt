Background & aims:HIV and viral hepatitis co-infected patients are at high risk for hepatocarcinoma. The contribution of immunodeficiency is not well documented. We aimed at estimating the relationship between the occurrence of hepatocarcinoma and both types of measures of immunodeficiency, current and cumulative (time below a given threshold), to assess their independent effects.Methods:HIV-infected adults included in the ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort with no history of cancer, ≥ 3 months of follow-up between 1998 and 2008, ≥ 1 CD4+ cell count (CD4+), and documented hepatitis virus status were eligible. Extended Cox proportional hazards models with delayed entry were used to estimate the risk of hepatocarcinoma. Exposure to a CD4+ Results:Sixteen cases of hepatocarcinoma were diagnosed among the 2864 eligible patients, the incidence rate was 0.78 case/1000 person-years (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.40-1.16). Current CD4+ Conclusions:Presenting with CD4+
