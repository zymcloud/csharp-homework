Bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol F (BPF) are widely used to manufacture plastics and epoxy resins. Both compounds have been shown to be present in the environment and are food contaminants, with, as a result, a low but chronic exposure of humans. However, the fate and possible bioactivation of these compounds at the level of human cell lines was not completely elucidated yet. In this study, we investigated the ability of human cells (intestinal cell line: LS174T, hepatoma cell line: HepG2, and renal cell line: ACHN) to biotransform BPA and BPF, and focused on the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of these two bisphenols, through the use of a novel and efficient genotoxic assay based on the detection of histone H2AX phosphorylation. BPA and BPF were extensively metabolized in HepG2 and LS174T cell lines, with stronger biotransformation capabilities in intestinal cells than observed in liver cells. Both cell lines produced the glucuronide as well as the sulfate conjugates of BPA. Conversely, the ACHN cell line was found to be devoid of any metabolic capabilities for the two examined bisphenols. Cytotoxicity was tested for BPA, BPF, as well as one metabolite of BPF produced in vivo in rat, namely dihydroxybenzophenone (DHB). In the three cell lines used, we observed similar ranges of toxicity, with DHB being weakly cytotoxic, BPF exhibiting an intermediary cytotoxicity, and BPA being the most cytotoxic compound tested. BPA and DHB were not found to be genotoxic, whatever the cell line examined. BPF was clearly genotoxic in HepG2 cells. These results demonstrate that some human cell lines extensively metabolize bisphenols and establish the genotoxic potential of bisphenol F.
