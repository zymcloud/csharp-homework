A 74-year-old man, whose chief complaint was epigastralgia, was referred to our hospital and diagnosed gastric cancer with liver metastasis. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a tumor on the lesser curvature of cardia of stomach. He was diagnosed as neuroendocrine cell carcinoma by biopsy specimens. He was treated by combined chemotherapy of CPT-11 and CDDP. After 11 courses, endoscopic examination revealed a complete disappearance of the primary tumor. CT-scan and MRI showed that the liver metastasis had been disappeared. We diagnosed as clinical CR and performed total gastrectomy with lymph node dissection and partial hepatectomy. Histological findings revealed a few cells in stomach and no cancer cells in the liver. He was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy of S-1. After 3-course, he suffered from anemia of grade 3, thus we interrupted chemotherapy. The patient remains alive for 28 months without recurrence. We conclude that chemotherapy was effective for neuroendocrine cell carcinoma of the stomach, which was to be considered of poor prognosis, and that liver resectomy was often effective.
