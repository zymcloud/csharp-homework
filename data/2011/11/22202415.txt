A 70-year-old man with type B hepatitis had ruptured HCC in segment 5, and he underwent with TAE at other hospital in June 2007. Then, he was introduced to our hospital in July 2007. Partial hepatectomy( S5) was performed in August 2007 (pT2N0M0, Stage II). Afterward, he underwent TACE therapy twice because of multiple intrahepatic recurrences. Abdominal CT revealed a viable recurrence lesion (S5), and peritoneal dissemination (surface of S3) in June 2009. We carried out partial hepatectomy (S5), and removal of peritoneal dissemination because of good liver function and without any other extra hepatic recurrence in July 2009. Histologically, the intrahepatic lesion( S5) and the S3 surface lesion were diagnosed as moderately differentiated HCC. In July 2010, abdominal CT revealed three lesions of peritoneal dissemination (right subphrenic lesion, hepatic flexure of the colon, neighborhood of left ureter, then the second removal of peritoneal dissemination was performed. In January 2011, he had multiple lung metastatic lesions, and multiple bone metastatic lesions were occurred in March 2011, then his general condition was getting worse. In April 2011, he was dead 46 months after the first TAE therapy for ruptured HCC, or 21 months after the first resection of peritoneal dissemination. Surgical resection of peritoneal dissemination of HCC may improve a survival for patients whose intrahepatic lesion is contorollable.
