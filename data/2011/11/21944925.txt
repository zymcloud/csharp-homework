We recently established that GL-V9, a newly synthetic flavonoid derivative, is an active cytotoxic component. In this study, we demonstrated that GL-V9 inhibited cells growth via inducing apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Following the treatment of HepG2 cells with GL-V9, we observed poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, while caspase-8 remained unchanged. The expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was also decreased in GL-V9-treated cells. Meanwhile, the cell cycle-related proteins, such as cyclin B1, CDK1 and cdc25 were down-regulated in GL-V9-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we showed that GL-V9-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells was achieved through mitochondrial pathway. It also regulated changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Besides, the growth inhibitory effect of GL-V9 was examined in vivo using murine implanted tumor model. These studies indicate that GL-V9 shows promise as a therapeutic agent against human hepatoma.
