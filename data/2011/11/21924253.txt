Background:This study was undertaken to investigate whether serum cytokeratin-1 (CK1) could complement alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to improve the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:CK1 was identified using western blot and ELISA in serum samples from 250 Egyptian patients including 150 with HCC, 100 with liver cirrhosis (LC) and 50 healthy controls. Multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) and ROC curve analyses were used to create a predictive model including CK1 in addition to a panel of routine blood markers.Results:CK1 was identified at 67 kDa and quantified in sera of HCC patients using western blot and ELISA. MDA selected a score for the prediction of HCC from LC patients based on levels of CK1, albumin and AFP. An area under the ROC curves (AUC) of the score was 0.87. The score showed a sensitivity of 87% vs 39% sensitivity of AFP at cutoff value of 200 IU/ml for prediction HCC. Absolute specificity (100%) was obtained to discriminate HCC from healthy individuals.Conclusions:This study suggests that the use of a combination of score including CK1, AFP and albumin in clinical practice provides a non invasive and simple test that could increase significantly the sensitivity of HCC diagnosis.
