Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant neoplasms occuring worldwide. Although surgical resection still remains the treatment of choice for HCC, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has emerged as reliable alternatives to resection. It is less invasive and can be repeated after short intervals for sequential ablation in case of multiple lesions. The most common complication of RFA is liver abscess, and bile duct injury such as bile duct stricture has been reported. This is a case report of a rare complication of abscesso-colonic fistula after RFA for HCC. The case was treated by percutaneous abscess drainage and antibiotics and occlusion of abscesso-colonic fistula with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate embolization.
