A case of a 68-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is presented. He underwent partial liver resection for three times and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for three times. Follow-up CT revealed a recurrent hepatic surface mass with malignant extended into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right atrium (RA). CT scan also revealed multiple metastatic nodules in bilateral lungs. The tumor thrombus into the RA and the hepatic surface mass were successfully treated with surgical resection. Pathological specimen allowed the diagnosis of poorly-differentiated HCC. Adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 resulted in complete remission of lung metastases. Tumor markers showed a significant improvement after S-1 administration. This case report suggests that a surgical resection followed by S-1 administration would be effective for a patient with lung metastases and a tumor thrombus into IVC or RA.
