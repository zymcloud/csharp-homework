Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs mainly in chronically diseased livers following hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Early detection and diagnosis of HCC would be of great clinical benefit. In this study, we used a random phage display peptide library and sera from early-stage primary HCC patients (n = 30) to screen potential serum biomarkers for early primary HCC. Age- and sex-matched patients with HBV and/or HCV infection were used as controls. In the screening phase, 19 out of 20 randomly selected phage clones exhibited specific reaction with purified sera IgG from early primary HCC patients, among them 14 coming from the same phage clone with inserted peptidesequence RGWCRPLPKGEG (named HC1). In the validation phase, phage ELISA results showed that the positive reaction rate of the HC1 phage clone was 91.4% with the early HCC group (n = 70), significantly higher than that with the HBV infection group (20.0%) (n = 70), the HCV infection group (12.9%) (n = 70), the HBV + HCV infection group (24.3%) (n = 70), the cirrhosis group (17.1%) (n = 70), and the healthy control group (10.0%) (n = 70). In conclusion, the HC1 mimic peptide showed high diagnostic validity for early primary HCC, and thereby could be a candidate serum biomarker for early primary HCC.
