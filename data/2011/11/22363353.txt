Background:Chronic hepatitis C infection is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), and its clinical complications include liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is an important cytokine in cell growthand differentiation, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation, immune responseregulation, and cancer development and progression.Objectives:The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TGF-β1 and chronic HCV infection among patients referred to the Taleghani Hospital, Tehran, Iran between 2008 and 2010.Patients and methods:In this case-control study, samples were collected using a convenience sampling method. We genotyped 164 HCV patients and 169 healthy controls for 3 SNPs in the TGF-β1 gene (-509 promoter, codon 10, and codon 25). We determined the SNP genotypes by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. To confirm the PCR-RFLP genotyping results, 10% of the samples were re-genotyped using a direct sequencing method.Results:There were no significant differences in the allelic frequency distribution of SNPs at -509 C/T, +869 C/T, or +915 G/C between HCV patients and the healthy controls. Genotyping results for all three polymorphic sites were similar with no statistically significant differences between the groups.Conclusions:Most of the Iranian patients (over 85%), both healthy controls and HCV patients, had the GG genotype at the +915 G/C position, resulting in a high level of TGF-β1 production. Therefore, we concluded that the SNPs investigated by us cannot be considered as prognostic factors for HCV infection in our population, despite being reported as prognostic markers in other populations. Moreover, there is a possibility that most of the population is susceptible to HCV infection.
