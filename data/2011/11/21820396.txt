Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can result from hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease and is the fastest-growing cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) has been used as a prognostic factor for HCC, but the value of AFP as a prognostic factor for HCV-related HCC in the United States is unknown. We investigated whether higher levels of AFP at the time of diagnosis are associated with increased mortality of patients with HCV-related HCC.Methods:In a retrospective study, we collected data from a cohort of HCV-infected veterans, identifying incident HCC cases from October 1, 1998, to January 1, 2007 (n = 1480 patients). The mean serum levels of AFP, obtained within 60 days before to 30 days after HCC diagnosis, were determined for 1064 patients and categorized as less than 10 ng/mL (18%), 10 to less than 100 ng/mL (30%), 100 to less than 1000 ng/mL (22%), or 1000 ng/mL or more (29%). Cox proportional hazard models were used to associate serum levels of AFP with mortality, adjusting for demographic features, clinical factors, and treatment.Results:The median survival times were significantly lower among patients with higher levels of AFP: 709 days for patients with less than 10 ng/mL, 422 days for patients with 10 to less than 100 ng/mL, 208 days for patients with 100 to less than 1000 ng/mL, and 68 days for patients with 1000 ng/mL or more. In the multivariate analysis, increased levels of AFP (10 to Conclusions:Serum AFP level at the time of diagnosis with HCV-related HCC is an independent predictor of mortality.
