For recurrent hepatic tumors with treatment history or cirrhosis, small region including extrahepatic tumors that cannot be identified on routine ultrasonography, we used a fluorescent imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) for repeated resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patients were consisted of 4 men and 2 women with a mean age of 61.5 (37-66) years. Five cases of intra or extra hepatic tumors could be identified with fluorescent imaging system. Two cases were a local recurrence after TACE, 1 case was a small tumor exited in liver surface, 1 case could be identified the area of vascular invasion of subcutaneous recurrence, and 1 case was a mediastinal small lymph node metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Fluorescent imaging using ICG was considered to be useful for identification of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma that cannot be identified by a routine ultrasonography.
