We report on a case of a female patient diagnosed with inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver in association with spilled gallstones 3 years after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for calculous acute cholecystitis. She was asymptomatic, but CT revealed an intrahepatic mass and two other extrahepatic masses between the liver and the diaphragm. Furthermore, diffusion-weighted MRI and PET suggested all three lesions could be malignant tumors. As the preoperative diagnosis was intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma with peritoneal disseminations, we performed a posterior segmentectomy of the liver combined with partial resection of the diaphragm. Histological examination showed the intrahepatic tumor was an inflammatory granuloma with abscess formations. There were bilirubin stones between the liver and the diaphragm. Therefore, the tumor was diagnosed as inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver in association with spilled gallstones. In conclusion, the liver tumor emerged after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and may involve inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver in association with spilled gallstones.
