Dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway frequently occurs in human tumors, and is therefore considered to be a good molecular target for treatment. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), overexpression of p-Akt and decrease of PTEN expression have been reported. NVP-BEZ235 is a novel dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR; however, its effect on HCC has not been documented. Consequently, we investigated the effects of NVP-BEZ235 on the PLC/PRF/5, HLE, JHH7 and HepG2 HCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. NVP-BEZ235 decreased the levels of p-Akt and p-p70S6K and inhibited cell proliferation in all HCC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that inhibition of cell proliferation by NVP-BEZ235 was accompanied by G1 arrest in all cell lines, and that NVP-BEZ235 induced apoptosis in PLC/PRF/5 and HLE cells. Tumor growth was suppressed without body weight loss when NVP-BEZ235 was orally administered to JHH-7 tumor-bearing mice for 11 days. These results suggest that NVP-BEZ235 is a potential new candidate for targeted HCC therapy.
