P300 impacts the transcription of several genes involved in biological behavior of human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We found p300 is highly expressed in 47% of surgically resected HCC specimens by immunohistochemistry, which correlated with advanced TNM staging (P = 0.034), vascular invasion (P = 0.036), intrahepatic metastasis (P = 0.001) and shortened overall survival (P = 0.028). In vitro study, knocking down of p300 expression in hepatoma cells recovered E-cadherin expression, inhibited the translocation of beta (Î²)-catenin into the nuclei, decreased cyclin D1 activity and suppressed the migration/invasion of HCC cells. Furthermore, suppression of p300 led to down-regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related molecules such as Snail, Twist and HIF-1 alpha. These observations suggest that p300 contributes to the EMT-related progression of HCCs.
