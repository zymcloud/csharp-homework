Background and aims:Liver failure from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasing indication for liver transplant and recurrence of fatty liver in transplanted grafts has been documented. Herein is described an atypical recurrence of steatosis as a de novo focal fatty lesion that mimicked a more ominous cancerous lesion. This presentation of recurrent NAFLD has not previously been described in the literature.Methods:Chart review.Results:Biopsy of an atypical lesion was found to be focal fat with surrounding steatohepatitis.Conclusions:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may recur after liver transplant and manifest as a focal fatty lesion. It is important to catalogue the atypical presentations of the increasingly common NAFLD developing in transplanted livers.
