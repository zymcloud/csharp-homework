Background:Metastasectomy is the standard treatment for patients with resectable liver metastasis from colon cancer. This study aimed to determine the impact of initial stage on overall survival (OS) after metastasectomy.Methods:A retrospective analysis of 2804 patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1999 and 2008.Results:Of the cohort, 38.1% of the patients were stage IV or had recurrence after curative surgery, and 131 received liver metastasectomy. The 5-year survival rate for patients after liver metastasectomy was 42.1%. The 5-year survival rates after metastasectomy for initial stage I disease, stage II disease, stage III disease, and stage IV disease were 100%, 82.5%, 31.8%, and 36.9%, respectively (p = 0.014). When patients were grouped as initial stage I/II and stage III/IV, the 5-year survival rate after liver metastasectomy differed significantly (83.9% vs. 35.7%, p = 0.006). Patients with initial stage I/II disease after liver metastasectomy had a significantly better 5-year progression-free period compared to those with stage III/IV disease (60% vs. 28%, p = 0.021), which was due to the lower recurrence rate in the stage I/II group.Conclusion:Our results suggest that patients who receive liver metastasectomy for metastatic colon cancer should be grouped into two groups: those with initial stages I and II disease, and those with stages III and IV disease, since the progression-free survivals (PFS) and OS after metastasectomy in these two groups differ significantly.
