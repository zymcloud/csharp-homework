We report a case of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with right atrial tumor thrombus treated by interferon (IFN)-combinated chemotherapies and second look operation. A case was a 56-year-old man who had right upper abdominal and back pain. The abdominal CT revealed an early enhanced lesion in the posterior segment of the liver with right atrial tumor thrombus. The patient underwent 2 courses of IFN-Î²/adriamycin combination therapy and followed by surgical resection. Due to severe congestive live, we only surgically resected tumor thrombi at right atrium, inferior vena cava, and right hepatic vein. Additionally, we closed posterior branch and right hepatic vein to prevent from a tumor progression. Following 16 months of IFN/5-FU and IFN/S-1 therapy, we performed a right posterior sectionectomy of the liver. Twelve months after the second operation, liver tumor relapsed and we performed transcatheter arterial chemoembolizatin, followed by IFN-combinateted chemotherapies. Thereafter, we continued chemotherapy for 14 months. The tumor progressed into the bile duct, and he died after 3 years and 8 months from the initial treatment. The case suggests that some patients with HCC with major vascular invasion and tumor thrombus can gain a long-term survival by multifocal treatment including surgery and chemotherapy.
