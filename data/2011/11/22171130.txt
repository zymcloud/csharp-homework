Aim:To evaluate the clinical significance of oxidative stress markers in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Sixty-four consecutive patients who were admitted to Kagoshima University Medical and Dental Hospital were enrolled in this retrospective study. All patients had chronic liver disease (CLD) due to infection with HCV. Thirty patients with HCV-related HCC, 34 with HCV-related CLD without HCC (non-HCC), and 20 healthy volunteers (HVs) were enrolled. Possible associations between serum manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and thioredoxin (TRX) levels and clinical parameters or patient prognosis were analyzed over a mean follow-up period of 31.7 mo.Results:The serum MnSOD levels were significantly higher in patients with HCV-related HCC than in patients without HCC (P = 0.03) or HVs (P Conclusion:Serum MnSOD and TRX levels are potential clinical biomarkers that predict patient prognosis in HCV-related HCC.
