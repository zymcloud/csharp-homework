Some colorectal liver metastases disappear during chemotherapy. Some of those disappearing lesions recur, but there are few reports aiming this topic. We examined 6 patients with 55 disappearing liver metastases (DLMs) during mFOLFOX6 regimen. Six DLMs were resected, of which 3 (50%) had remnant cancer cells. Among the 49 DLMs not resected, 9 recurred after 23.5 (4.2-41.4) months. Cumulative risks of recurrence were 10.5% at 1 year, 10.5% at 2 years and 27. 5% at 3 years. Among these, some went through additional mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI regimen after they disappeared, but there was no significant difference among the number of the chemotherapy regimen and whether recurrences occur or not. The recurrence rate of the DLMs may be small, but further review with larger-scale group of DLMs is warranted.
