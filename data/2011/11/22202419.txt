In this study, we evaluate the capability of pure laparoscopic surgery for repeat hepatectomy. From June 2010 through March 2011, 15 cases of primary hepatectomy (hepatocellular carcinoma 11, liver metastasis 4) and 6 cases of re-hepatectomy patients (all cases were hepatocellular carcinoma) were underwent pure laparoscopic hepatectomy. As for the liver function in primary hepatectomy and re-hepatectomy, liver damage A/B was 8/7 and 2/4, median ICG R15 was 18 (4- 42) % and 30 (10-35) %, respectively. As for operative variables in primary hepatectomy and re-hepatectomy, the median operative duration was 265 (105-673) minutes, 296 (157-475) minutes, the median amount of bleeding was 10 (small amount-2,000) cc, 25 (small amount-140) cc, and the median post-operative hospital stay was 10 (6-17) days and 11 (6-24) days, respectively. Primary hepatectomy and re-hepatectomy represented equal clinical outcomes, although re-hepatectomy patients had lower hepatic function compared with primary hepatectomy patients.
