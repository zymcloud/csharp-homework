In December 2008, a 43-year-old male who had been pointed out a nodular shadow in the right upper field on a chest radiography was admitted to hospital. A 35 mm mass infiltrating to superior vena cava in the right upper lobe of the lung, and 32 mm mass in the liver at S7 were detected by CT. Pathological diagnosis of the liver tumor was adenocarcinoma. Under the diagnosis of lung carcinoma and liver metastasis, systemic chemotherapy was started from January 2009. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy was added for liver S7 mass in February, and radiation therapy was performed for lung mass in December. The lung lesion has markedly reduced, but the liver lesion recurred in October 2009, which continued to grow up to 80 mm until August 2010. He presented to our hospital with the diagnosis of liver metastasis of controlled primary lung cancer. In October, we performed right hepatectomy with diaphragma and right lung resection. The pathological diagnosis was intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Multiple recurrences in remnant liver, lung and peritoneal metastasis were detected in January 2011. For intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, hepatectomy is the only established treatment, and RFA treatment remains controversial. Clinical diagnosis of multiple cancers should be decided with caution.
