Hemorrhage and postoperative liver insufficiency are frequent and serious complications of hepatic resection in cirrhotic patients.

We retrospectively reviewed the results of 35 patients who had undergone resection for monofocal hepatocellular carcinoma at our center. Thirteen patients (Group A) had undergone liver resection with Kelly clamp crushing resection, 22 patients (Group B) had had liver resection assisted with a bipolar radiofrequency device. Radiofrequency-assisted liver resection was associated with diminished blood loss (P
