We report here the experience of the treatment with sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in our department. Forty patients received the therapy of sorafenib until April 2011. Twenty seven unresectable advanced HCC, 7 lung metastasis, 6 bone metastasis, 3 abdominal lymph node metastasis, and 2 peritoneal dissemination were included. The median duration of sorafenib treatment was 197 days. Grade 3 adverse event occurred in 9 patients (22.5%), and grade 4 adverse event occurred in 1 patient (3%). The response rate and disease control rate were 5% and 55%, respectively (CR 2, PR 0, SD 20, PD 9). The median overall survival was 15.2 months, and median recurrence-free survival was 3.7 months. These results suggested that a prevention of adverse events would lead to a continued treatment with sorafenib, and could expect to have a prolonged survival in patients with advanced HCC.
