A 77-year-old man was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma, and was referred to our hospital. After he was treated by transcatheter chemoembolization, he underwent a left hepatic lobectomy of the liver and cholecystectomy. Serum AFP and PIVKA-II remarkably elevated 7 months after surgery, and CT scan revealed multiple metastatic nodules in bilateral lungs. The nodules were diagnosed as lung metastasis of HCC. Because the lesions grew larger, S-1/IFN was administered. Diagnostic imaging and tumor markers showed a marked improvement after 4 courses of S-1/IFN therapy, and he is still alive with good condition without recurrence and progression of tumors.
