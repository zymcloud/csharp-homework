Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and bile duct carcinomas (BDC) have a poor prognosis since they are often detected at advanced stages and respond poorly to adjuvant therapy. Serum markers (e.g. AFP, CA19-9, etc.) can be used for early detection of these tumours but have only moderate sensitivity and specificity. The Golgi-associated protein GOLPH2 was found in the tissue and serum of patients with HCC and CCC and might be used to detect these tumours in time. The biopsy still remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of HCC and CCC. When biopsies are taken from these tumours they are often fragmented and contain reactive changes. Therefore immunohistochemical markers can aid in excluding or ascertaining malignancy. Studies have shown that the oncofetal protein "IGF-II mRNA-binding protein 3" (IMP3), the cell adhesion molecules P-cadherin and CD24, the cancer testis antigen MAGE-C2/CT-10 as well as the protein periostin can be used as tissue markers in the diagnosis of HCC and CCC.
