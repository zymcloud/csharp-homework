Background:The indications and endpoints for treatment of chronic hepatitis B continue to evolve. The aim of the therapy for chronic hepatitis B is to achieve a long-term continued suppression of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA to prevent disease progression leading to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Aim:To summarise current literature on therapy of chronic hepatitis B, with a focus on indications for therapy, preferred treatment options, and management of resistance and partial responders.Methods:A systematic review of the literature, with a focus on international guidelines, was performed.Results:Seven drugs are licensed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in many countries. The selection of a drug with high potency and low rate of resistance is essential to achieve rapid and long-term viral suppression. The prevention of the sequelae of antiviral drug resistance and appropriate management of viral breakthrough are major goals of current management. The addition or change to an antiviral agent that is not cross-resistant is critical to restore suppression of viral replication for patients with breakthrough resistance. Patient adherence to medication is essential to achieve adequate HBV DNA suppression.Conclusions:The current treatment strategy of chronic hepatitis B is now standard: initial selection of entecavir, tenofovir, or peginterferon alfa-2a. Future studies are required to determine if combination therapy using two oral agents or peginterferon with an oral agent with a high genetic barrier to resistance might be superior to standard current monotherapy.
