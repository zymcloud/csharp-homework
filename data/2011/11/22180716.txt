Aim:To investigate the effects of laparoscopic hepatectomy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From 2006 to January 2011, laparoscopic hepatectomies were performed on 30 cases of HCC at Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital. During this same time period, 30 patients elected to undergo conventional open hepatectomy over laparoscopic hepatectomy at the time of informed consent. The degree of invasiveness and outcomes of laparoscopic hepatectomy compared to open hepatectomy for HCC were evaluated.Results:Both groups presented with similar blood loss amounts, operating times and complications. Patients in the laparoscopic hepatectomy group started walking and eating significantly earlier than those in the open hepatectomy group, and these more rapid recoveries allowed for shorter hospitalizations. There were no significant differences between procedures in survival rate.Conclusion:Laparoscopic hepatectomy is beneficial for patient quality of life if the indications are appropriately based on preoperative liver function and the location and size of the HCC.
