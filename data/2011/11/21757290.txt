Hepatitis C virus Core plays a vital role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma; however, its action mechanism is still controversial. Here, we showed that Core down-regulated levels of p16, resulting in inactivation of Rb and subsequent activation of E2F1, which lead to growth stimulation of hepatocytes. For this effect, Core inhibited p16 expression by inducing promoter hypermethylation via up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3b. The growth stimulatory effect of Core was abolished when levels of p16 were restored by either exogenous complementation or treatment with 5-Aza-2'dC, indicating that the effect is critical for the stimulation of cell growth by Core.
