Sorafenib is a novel, orally administered multi-kinase inhibitor that has recently been approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. We report three cases of hepatocellular carcinoma without distant metastasis effectively treated by sorafenib. Case 1 was a 71-year-old male with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas, Child-Pugh status A, and asthma. He received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The efficacy evaluated by the RECIST was partial response. Case 2 was a 75-year-old male with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas and Child-Pugh status A. He previously received surgical resection and transarterial chemoembolization. He received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The efficacy evaluated by the RECIST and modified RECIST was partial response and complete response, respectively. Case 3 was a 62-year-old male with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas and Child-Pugh status A. He previously received surgical resection, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation therapy and transarterial chemoembolization. He received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The efficacy evaluated by the RECIST was stable disease. The majority of adverse events were grade 1-2 stomatitis and hand-foot skin reaction. No patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse events. Sorafenib might be promising as an effective therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma without distant metastasis.
