A small animal imaging system for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific reporter gene expression will enable monitoring of carcinogenesis or therapeutic intervention in vivo. Transgenic mouse was developed in which firefly luciferase (fLuc) expression was controlled by the AFP enhancer/promoter. The bioluminescent signals of the transgenic neonates were strong at their liver region and decreased after birth. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) of a transgenic mouse treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine revealed distinct fLuc activity in the liver and an increased pattern with time. The transgenic mouse model can be used to monitor AFP producing HCC by a chemical carcinogen in a live animal by BLI.
