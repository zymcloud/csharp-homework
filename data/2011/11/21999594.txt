Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of hepatectomy combined with inferior vena cava (IVC) resection and reconstruction for treatment of invasive liver tumours.Methods:From February 1995 to September 2010, 2146 patients underwent liver resections in our hospital's hepatopancreatobiliary unit. Of these, 35 (1.6%) patients underwent hepatectomy with IVC resection. These patients were included in this study. Data were analysed from a prospectively collected database.Results:Resections were carried out for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) (n= 21), hepatocellular carcinoma (n= 6), cholangiocarcinoma (n= 3) and other conditions (n= 5). Resections were carried out with total vascular occlusion in 34 patients and without in one patient. In situ hypothermic perfusion was performed in 13 patients; the ante situm technique was used in three patients, and ex vivo resection was used in six patients. There were four early deaths from multiple organ failure. Postoperative complications occurred in 14 patients, three of whom required re-operation. Median overall survival was 29 months and cumulative 5-year survival was 37.7%. Rates of 1-, 2- and 5-year survival were 75.9%, 58.7% and 19.6%, respectively, in CRLM patients.Conclusions:Aggressive surgical management of liver tumours with IVC involvement offers the only hope for cure in selected patients. Resection by specialist teams affords acceptable perioperative morbidity and mortality rates.
