Backgrounds/aims:By reviewing difficult resections for advanced hepatic malignancies, we discuss the effectiveness and extended indications for hepatectomy in such patients.Methods:We reviewed 7 patients who underwent extensive surgery between July 2008 and March 2011 for advanced hepatic malignancies. They had stage IV disease, except for in one case that was a stage IIIC (T4N0M0) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:Patient 1 with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) underwent right hemihepatectomy and resection of the bile duct and left portal vein. At 39 months after surgery, she had no recurrence or metastasis. Patient 2 with HCC underwent palliative right trisectionectomy. At 38 months after surgery, he is alive despite residual pulmonary metastases. Patient 3 with HCC invading the hepatic vein and diaphragm underwent right trisectionectomy and caval venoplasty. At 12 months after surgery, he had no recurrence or metastasis. Patient 4, who had 2 large HCCs and pulmonary thromboembolism, underwent a right trisectionectomy. At 7 months after surgery, he had no evidence of recurred HCC. Patient 5, who had IHCC invading her inferior vena cava and main portal vein, underwent preoperative radiotherapy, left hemihepatectomy, and caval resection. At 20 months after surgery, she is well despite a caval thrombus. Patient 6 and 7 underwent repeated surgery due to a recurred IHCC and metastatic colon cancer, respectively. In addition, they are alive during each 20 and 17 months after surgery.Conclusions:Despite macroscopic extrahepatic metastases or major vessel involvement, extensive surgery for advanced hepatic malignancy may result in relatively favorable outcomes and be important modality for improving of survival in such patients.
