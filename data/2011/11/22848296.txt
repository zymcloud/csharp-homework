The correlation between decreased levels of selenium and increased DNA damage and oxidative stress shows the significance of this trace element. A number of studies have provided evidence for lower serum, plasma and tissue levels of selenium in patients with various diseases and types of cancer. In this study, liver selenium concentrations were measured in tissue samples of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by atomic absorption spectrometry. The results showed that the selenium concentrations decreased when the malignant grade increased. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between selenium levels and human selenium binding protein-1 (SELENBP1) down-regulation in the liver. Therefore, we suggest that the evaluation of selenium and SELENBP1 concentrations can be used for improving the prognosis of HCC.
