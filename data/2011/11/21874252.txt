The fucosylated fraction of α-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) is a specific marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, conventional AFP-L3% (c-AFP-L3%) has not always been reliable in cases with low serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. In this study, we evaluated the clinical utility of a newly developed assay, highly sensitive AFP-L3% (hs-AFP-L3%). Subjects included 74 patients with benign liver disease (BLD), including chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, and 94 with HCC. Serum hs-AFP-L3% was significantly higher than c-AFP-L3% in patients with early-stage HCC (solitary or
