MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that are often located in genomic breakpoint regions and can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in human cancer. Our previous study showed that microRNA-423 (miR-423), which localized to the frequently amplified region of chromosome 17q11, was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the potential functions and exact mechanistic roles of miR-423 in hepatic carcinogenesis remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that miR-423 significantly promotes cell growth and cell cycle progression at the G(1)/S transition in HCC cells. In particular, we found that miR-423-3p contributes to these effects, whereas miR-423-5p does not. Further studies revealed that p21Cip1/Waf1 is a downstream target of miR-423 in HCC cells, as miR-423 bound directly to its 3' untranslated region and reduced both the messenger RNA and protein levels of p21Cip1/Waf1. Moreover, enforced expression of p21Cip1/Waf1 abrogated miR-423-induced effects on HCC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. These findings indicate that miR-423 exerts growth-promoting effects in hepatic carcinogenesis through the suppression of tumor suppressor p21Cip1/Waf1 expression. The results of this study define miR-423 as a new oncogenic miRNA in HCC.
