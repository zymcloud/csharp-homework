Objective:To study the effect of 1,2,6-Tri-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranose (BJA32531) on the miRNA expression during BJA32531-induced cytotoxicity in human HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells.Methods:Cell proliferation was assessed using a colorimetric assay (cell counting kit-8). Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V and propidium iodide staining. The miRNA expression profile of the cancer cells was analyzed by a miRNA array and quantitative real-time PCR.Results:BJA32531 inhibited the cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in HepG2 cancer cells. Cellular exposure to BJA32531 influenced the miRNA expression pattern in the cells, including 19 upregulated and 85 down-regulated miRNAs in the cells. The up-regulations of let-7a and miR-10b as well as the down-regulations of miR-132 and miR-125b were verified to be consistent with the the results of the miRNA array.Conclusion:Our study suggests that the mechanisms by which BJA32531 exerted the antiproliferative effects on HepG2 cancer cells may be related to its regulation of miRNA.
