A 68-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C and of a heavy drinker was admitted to our hospital because of a huge liver tumor (10cm in diameter) in segment-5 detected on CT in July 2009. One month later, the size of liver tumor was reduced to 5cm in diameter and another liver tumor of 1cm in segment-3 was detected on CT. AFP and AFP-L3 spontaneously decreased to normal range. In October, a partial hepatectomy was performed. The resected specimen demonstrated complete necrosis with thick capsule. The tumor in segment-3 became equivocal without resection. We considered this is a case of spontaneous complete necrosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
