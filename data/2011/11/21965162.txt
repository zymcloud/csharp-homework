We report the case of a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with Xp11.2 translocation/transcription factor E3 (TFE3) gene fusion who had presented with sunitinib-induced nephrotic syndrome in association with favorable and durable treatment response. The nephrotic syndrome was managed successfully by discontinuing sunitinib and symptomatic treatment. The 27-year-old female patient presenting with right upper abdominal pain was diagnosed with Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma on the right side with multiple pulmonary and hepatic metastases. She underwent radical nephrectomy and took a daily dose of 37.5 mg sunitinib. Partial response to sunitinib was achieved and maintained for 5 months, but when nephrotic syndrome occurred, drug intake was discontinued. The nephrotic syndrome gradually resolved around 2 months after discontinuation of sunitinib and medical management. Our case highlighted the favorable response of a particular non-clear cell type renal cell carcinoma to sunitinib and the specific toxicity associated with the antiangiogenic effect of sunitinib.
