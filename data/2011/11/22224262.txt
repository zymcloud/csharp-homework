Four triterpenoids isolated from the leaves of Fadogia tetraquetra var. tetraquetra, 3beta-hydroxy-11alpha, 12alpha-epoxyoleanan-28,13beta-olide (1), 3beta-hydroxyurs-11-en-28,13beta-olide (2), oleanolic acid (3), and ursolic acid (4), were evaluated for their antiviral and antibacterial properties. Compound 4 showed potent activity against the Semliki Forest virus with an IC50 of 14.7 microM, but was also found to be significantly cytotoxic (68% reduction in cell viability after 24 hours exposure at 50 microM) towards baby hamster kidney (BHK21) host cells. A viability assay on the mammalian human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cell line showed no significant effects on intracellular ATP content after 48 hours exposure to compounds 1-4 at this concentration. Compound 4 also inhibited Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 12.5 microM), but was inactive against Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Compounds 1-3 were inactive against all tested bacterial strains at 50 microM concentration.
