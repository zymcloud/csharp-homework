Objective:To explore the mechanism by which HBV X gene(HBx) inhibits apoptosis of human hepatoma cell line HepG2 in terms of miRNA.Methods:Three cell lines were prepared: HepG2 cells stably transfected with HBx (HepG2/HBx), HepG2 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 (HepG2/pcDNA3.1) and HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry was adopted to measure the apoptosis of these three cells and Taqman fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to examine miR-192 expression. After HepG2 cells was transfected with miR-192, the apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry and the expressions of p53 and PUMA at mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by SYBR Green quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively.Results:Compared with HepG2/pcDNA3.1 cells (11.46% ± 0.69%) and HepG2 cells (12.5% ± 0.66%), the apoptosis rate of HepG2/HBx cells (2.37% ± 0.35%) was significantly reduced (F = 171.722, P Conclusion:HBx could inhibit apoptosis of HepG2 cells through down-regulation of miR-192 which induces apoptosis of HepG2 cells.
