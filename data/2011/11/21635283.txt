Aims:The present study examines the efficacy of a scalp cooling system to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia in people with cancer.Background:Alopecia has been established as the most distressing aspect of chemotherapy to such an extent that some patients even refrain from cytotoxic treatment.Methods:Using a quasi-experimental approach in 2007, a total number of 63 patients aged 16-59 years (mean 35 ± 5·5 years) participated in the study and were treated with an intravenous regimen of chemotherapy drug. Thirty-one patients accepting the scalp-cooling system were compared for alopecia with 32 participants who refused it. Hair loss in the participants was evaluated by nurses using World Health Organization criteria at each cycle of chemotherapy.Results:Using chi-square test differences between the two groups were statistically significant at cycles 2-6 (P < 0·05). Twenty-four participants (77·4%) of the study group were assessed as first and second grade of alopecia in the second cycle, whereas seven participants (22·6%) of this group exhibited third and fourth grade of alopecia. However, in the control group at the same cycle, 19 participants (61·3%) were assessed with third and fourth grade of alopecia. In the Sixth cycle 15 participants (50%) of the study group and 24 participants (75%) of the control group demonstrated third and fourth grade alopecia.Conclusion:A penguin cap can be an effective method to avoid alopecia in patients receiving chemotherapy drugs. However, it is important to bear in mind that because of individual characteristics, liver function and drug regimens it is not successful in all cases.
