We report a case of multiple advanced hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) with bilobar distribution treated by combination therapy of hepatectomy and particle therapy (carbon ion therapy). A 73-year-old man who had been pointed out hepatic tumors on abdominal CT was referred to our hospital in February 2010. Advanced HCCs; 8 cm Vp3 and 6 cm in the left lobe, 4 cm in the posterior segment, and 1 .5 cm in the S8 area, were detected by abdominal dynamic CT and EOB-MRI etc. Curative resection was not applied due to insufficiency of liver function and unfavorable anatomical tumor locations. Accordingly we have developed a novel combination therapy of hepatectomy and particle therapy. First we performed left lobectomy in March 2010, followed by administration of particle therapy to the posterior segment for local control in May. Then, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was administered 4 times for residual tumors. The patient survives for 15 months after the initial therapy with good local control.
