The allocation rules for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are awaiting liver transplantation (LT) are a difficult issue and are continually evolving. To reduce tumor progression or down-stage advanced disease, most transplant centers have adopted the practice of treating HCC candidates with resection or locoregional therapies. This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of bridge therapy in preventing removal from the waiting list for death/sickness severity or tumor progression beyond the Milan criteria and in determining posttransplant outcomes. The removal rates for 315 adult patients with HCC who were listed for LT were analyzed and were correlated to responses to bridge therapy with a competing risk analysis. The 3-, 6-, and 12-month dropout rates were 3.5%, 6.5%, and 19.9%, respectively, and they were significantly affected by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (P = 0.032), the tumor stage at diagnosis (P = 0.041), and the response to bridge therapy (P
