Aim:The X-ray repair cross-complementing group 7 (XRCC7) plays an important role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by nonhomologous end-joining repair (NEJR) pathway. However, the role of XRCC7 polymorphisms (rs#7003908 and rs#10109984) possibly influencing NEJR capacity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) has not been well elaborated.Methods:This hospital-based case-control study, including 348 patients with newly diagnosed HCC and 597 controls without any evidence of liver diseases, was conducted to elucidate the association between these two polymorphisms and the risk of HCC related to AFB1 exposure among a Guangxi population from a high AFB1-exposure area by means of TaqMAN-polymerase chain reaction technique.Results:We observed that HCC patients featured higher AFB1 exposure than control group (odds ratios [OR] = 6.49 and 6.75 for exposure years and exposure levels, respectively). Furthermore, these individuals with the genotypes of XRCC7 rs#7003908 G alleles (namely XRCC7-TG or -GG), compared the homozygote of XRCC7 rs#7003908 T alleles (XRCC7-TT), faced increasing risk of HCC (OR, 3.45 and 5.04; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 2.40-4.94 and 3.28-7.76, respectively). We also found some evidence that this polymorphism interacted with AFB1-expousure years or levels in the process of HCC carcinogenesis. Additionally, XRCC7 rs#7003908 polymorphism was correlated with the levels of AFB1-DNA adducts (r = 0.142, P 0.05).Conclusion:These data suggest that XRCC7 rs#7003908 polymorphism may be one of the genetic modifiers for AFB1-related HCC among Guangxi population.
