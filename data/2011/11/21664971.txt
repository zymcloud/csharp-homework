The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is worldwide sharply on the rise and patients with advanced disease carry a poor prognosis. HCC is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer associated deaths in the world. Intra-arterially administered (131)I-Lipiodol is selectively retained by hepatocellular carcinomas, and has been used as a vehicle for delivery of therapeutic agents to these tumours. In this review we focus on the therapeutic indications, usefulness and methods of treatment with 131-Iodine Lipiodol. The effectiveness of (131)I-Lipiodol treatment is proven both in the treatment of HCC with portal thrombosis and also as an adjuvant to surgery after the resection of HCCs. It is at least as effective as chemoembolization and is tolerated much better. Severe liver dysfunction represents theoretic contraindication for radioembolization as well as for TACE. In such cases (131)I-Lipiodol is an alternative therapy option especially in tumours smaller than 6cm.
