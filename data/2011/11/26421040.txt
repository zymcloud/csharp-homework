Backgrounds/aims:Surveillance programs and imaging modality developments have increased the detection rate of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In particular, liver transplantation produces good results and is now regarded an alternative to liver resection. However, optimal treatment for small HCC is still debated, and thus, the authors designed this study to document clinicopathological characteristics, to identify the prognostic factors of small HCC, and to determine the effectiveness of surgery.Methods:A total of 507 patients underwent curative liver resection for HCC between January 1996 and August 2006 in our institution. One hundred and thirty four of these patients with a single HCC of less than 3 cm and no gross vascular invasion were enrolled.Results:Major resection was performed in 32 (23.9%) patients; there was no postoperative mortality. Fifty-eight (43.3%) patients experienced recurrence, 53 developed intrahepatic recurrence alone, and 50 (94.3%) of 53 had tumors within the Milan criteria. Five-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 51.0% and 77.3%, respectively. Microscopic vascular invasion, positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen or antibody to hepatitis C, and an indocyanine green retention test at 15 minutes of more than 10% were found to be significantly correlated with disease-free overall survival. A platelet count of less than 100,000/mm(3) was the only independent prognostic factors of overall survival identified.Conclusions:This study showed favorable outcome comparable to the survival after liver transplantation, thus that liver resection appears to be the primary treatment option for small HCC, even in cases with poor prognostic factors.
