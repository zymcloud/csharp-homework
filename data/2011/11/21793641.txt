Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Data regarding the use of radiotherapy is limited in patients from populations without endemic viral hepatitis. We examine the outcomes for patients treated with radiotherapy in the modern era at a single institution.Material and methods:A total of 29 patients with localized hepatocellular carcinoma treated from 2000-2010 were reviewed. Patients with metastatic disease at the time of radiation were excluded. Median radiation dose was 50 Gy (range 30 to 75 Gy) with a median biologically effective dose of 80.6 (range 60 to 138.6). Median tumor size at the time of radiation was 5.2 cm (range 2 to 25 cm).Results:Eighty three percent of all patients had either stable disease or a partial response to radiation, based on RECIST criteria. Median change in tumor size following radiation was -17% (range -73.5 to 177.8%). Estimated one-year overall survival and in-field progression-free survival rates for the study population were 56% and 79%, respectively. One-year overall survival in patients treated to a biologically effective dose Discussion:In a population without endemic viral hepatitis, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma demonstrates significant response to radiotherapy with minimal toxicity. Furthermore, our findings suggest that increased biologically effective dose is associated with improved survival and local tumor control.
