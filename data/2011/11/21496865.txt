The formin-like 2 protein is a member of the diaphanous-related formin family that controls actin-dependent processes such as cell motility and invasion. This study aimed at clarifying formin-like 2 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and its correlation with clinicopathologic features and also exploring the effects of formin-like 2 transfection on cell motility and invasion in vitro. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting showed that expression of formin-like 2 was lower in 4 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines than those in normal hepatic epithelial cells (P
