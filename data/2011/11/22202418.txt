A 20-year-old man with juvenile hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without HBV, nor HCV infections. A complaint of pain in the right abdomen, wherein a bulky hepatic tumor occupying a large area of the right lobe as well as tumors that were 20 mm and 10 mm in size in liver regions S2 and S3, respectively, were observed via an abdominal CT scan. A biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of well-differentiated hepatocarcinoma. The main voluminous tumor mass in the right lobe was resected, but the tumor still remained in the lateral segment after the surgery. On day 21 after the surgery, we initiated a therapy for the remaining tumor. He is still alive 36 months after surgery.
