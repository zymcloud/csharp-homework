Treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include surgical resection, transcatheter arteral chemoembolization (TACE), percutaneous local therapy and systemic chemotherapy. However, it is difficult to perform a curative treatment for patients with far advanced multiple hepatocellular carcinomas. Here we report a case of successful surgical resection after repeated TACE for far advanced multiple hepatocellular carcinomas in both lobes associated with Vpâ‚‚ portal vein tumor thrombus. A 54-year-old male who had multiple HCC lesions in lateral, median and right lobes with portal vein tumor thrombus was admitted to our hospital. Three attempts of TACE resulted in a successful control of the tumors in the right lobe. Left hepatic lobectomy was therefore performed, and a relapse-free survival was obtained for over 5 years after surgery.
