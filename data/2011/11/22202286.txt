We report 3 cases of resectable pancreatic metastasis. CASE 1: A 76-year-old woman was followed after nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma for 13 years. CT examination demonstrated a high vascular lesion in the pancreatic body and tail. We conducted distal pancreatectomy and diagnosed with metastatic tumor from renal cell carcinoma. She died of liver metastasis 8 years after pancreatic resection. CASE 2: A 64-year-old man, who had undergone right lower lobectomy for lung cancer a year ago, was found to have a mass in the pancreatic tail. We performed distal pancreatectomy and diagnosed with metastatic tumor from lung cancer. He died of lung metastasis 12 months after pancreatic resection. CASE 3: A 62- year-old woman, who had undergone left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma 3 years ago, was found to have a mass in the pancreatic body. With a diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic tumor from renal cell carcinoma, distal pancreatectomy was done. She died of liver and lung metastases 15 months after pancreatic resection. Long-term survival can be achieved in patients undergoing a pancreatic standard resection including lymphadenectomy for isolated metastasis from nonpancreatic sites.
