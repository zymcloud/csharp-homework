Objective:The purpose of this article is to evaluate the value of gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary phase imaging and high-b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for distinguishing well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) from benign hepatocellular nodules in patients with chronic liver disease using 3-T MRI.Materials and methods:Forty-five patients with 46 well-differentiated HCCs (mean, 2.3 cm) and 21 patients with 24 benign hepatocellular nodules (five large regenerative nodules and 19 dysplastic nodules; mean, 1.8 cm) were included in this study. Diagnosis of well-differentiated HCCs and benign hepatocellular nodules was made histopathologically by percutaneous biopsy (n = 12 and n = 11, respectively) or surgical resection (n = 34 and n = 13, respectively). Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI was performed for all patients, and DWI (b values of 0 and 800 s/mm(2)) was performed for 31 well-differentiated HCCs and 11 benign hepatocellular nodules. Two radiologists performed a consensus review of the MRI scans for signal intensity compared with that of the surrounding liver parenchyma on hepatobiliary phase images and DWI (b value, 800 s/mm(2)) for qualitative analysis. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and relative contrast enhancement of lesions on hepatobiliary phase images and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were assessed for quantitative analysis.Results:In the qualitative analysis, 39 well-differentiated HCCs (85%) and 14 benign hepatocellular nodules (58%) were hypointense on hepatobiliary phase images, and seven well-differentiated HCCs (15%) and 10 benign hepatocellular nodules (42%) were iso- or hyperintense (p = 0.04). Twenty-five well-differentiated HCCs (81%) and three benign hepatocellular nodules (27%) were hyperintense on DWI, with b value of 800 s/mm(2), and six well-differentiated HCCs (19%) and eight benign hepatocellular nodules (73%) were iso- or hypointense (p = 0.01). When lesion hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase images or hyperintensity on DWI were considered signs of HCC in cirrhotic liver, our results yielded sensitivities of 85% and 81% and specificities of 42% and 73%, respectively. In the quantitative analysis, the mean (± SD) relative contrast enhancement ratio of the well-differentiated HCCs (0.76 ± 2.30) was significantly higher than that of benign hepatocellular nodules (0.25 ± 0.97) (p = 0.02). The lesion-to-liver CNRs and the mean ADC values were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05).Conclusion:Hypointensity on gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary phase images and hyperintensity on high-b-value DWI to surrounding liver parenchyma suggest well-differentiated HCCs rather than benign hepatocellular nodules in chronic liver disease.
