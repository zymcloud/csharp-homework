The role of sorafenib is unclear in multimodal treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We analyzed patients who underwent multimodal treatment including surgical operation for advanced HCC after administration of sorafenib. A 79- year-old man underwent extended right hepatectomy for Stage III huge HCC. Three years later, multiple recurrences observed in the liver, and an extrahepatic tumor was diagnosed. Peritoneal seeding was suspected, thus we decided to start a sorafenib administration. After 11 months, new intrahepatic lesions were detected, but extrahepatic tumor was unchanged. We considered the extrahepatic tumor was solitary and resectable, and new lesions in the liver were still treatable, then we attempted a surgical treatment with partial hepatectomy and ablation therapy. The tumor was successfully resected, and residual viable tumors were treated by radiofrequency ablation. The patient remains alive without recurrence at 7 months. We could perform a surgical treatment for another 2 patients with sorafenib treatment. These results suggested that there are cases of advance HCC in which multimodality treatment including surgical treatment can be achieved after sorafenib administration.
