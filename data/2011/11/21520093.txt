Background:The aim of this study is to identify the efficacy of portal vein embolization (PVE) before right hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with regard to hepatic function, surgical stress, and survival benefit.Methods:Fifty-five patients with HCC underwent right hepatectomy between 1999 and 2009. Preoperative PVE was performed in 19 patients (PVE group) and was not applied in 36 patients (non-PVE group). Changes in liver function and volume were investigated in PVE group. Short and long clinical outcomes after the surgeries were compared between the two groups.Results:The percentage of future liver remnant (%FLR) before PVE was significantly lower (37.8%) in PVE group than in non-PVE group (58.1%) but increased remarkably after PVE (from 37.8% to 55.0%, P Conclusions:Preoperative PVE improves resectability and may improve disease-free survival for patients with HCC requiring right hepatectomy.
