About 70 per cent of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed at intermediate or advanced stages, and most of them are technically unresectable. As a novel, emerging therapeutic modality, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has a great potential for tumor treatment. In this review, principle of HIFU technique is introduced, and an overview of clinical applications and limitations of HIFU for HCC treatment, as well as prospects for future development, is provided. Consequently, HIFU has been considered a safe and feasible procedure for HCC treatment.
