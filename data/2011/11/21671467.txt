MicroRNAs are involved in human carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Our previous study has shown that loss of miR-338-3p expression is associated with clinical aggressiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the exact roles and mechanisms of miR-338-3p remain unknown in HCC. To determine whether and how miR-338-3p influences liver cancer cell invasion, we studied miR-338-3p in the liver cancer cell lines, and we found that miR-338-3p is down-regulated in treated cells. Forced expression of miR-338-3p in SK-HEP-1 cells suppressed cell migration and invasion, whereas inhibition of miR-338-3p in SMMC-7721 cells induced cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, smoothened (SMO) was identified as a direct target of miR-338-3p. Forced expression of miR-338-3p down-regulated SMO and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression, but inhibition of miR-338-3p up-regulated SMO and MMP9 expression. However, small interfering RNA targeted SMO reversed the effects induced by blockade of miR-338-3p. SMO and MMP9 were overexpressed and associated with invasion and metastasis in HCC tissues. These data indicate that miR-338-3p suppresses cell invasion by targeting the smoothened gene in liver cancer in vitro and miR-338-3p might be a novel potential strategy for liver cancer treatment.
