The human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer with high mortality rate. We examined the density and coupling to phospholipase C (PLC) of the α(1)-adrenoceptors. In HCC liver, the α(1)-adrenoceptor density - as assessed by [³H]-Prazosin binding - was significantly reduced to about 75% when compared to non-adjacent non-tumorous liver (NA-NL) (P=0.0002). The decrease in maximal α(1)-adrenoceptor concentration (B(max)) was accompanied by a significant reduction in noradrenaline-stimulated PLC activity (P
