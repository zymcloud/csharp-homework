For patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, the goal of antiviral therapy is to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR). We review the durability of the SVR and its effects on liver-related mortality, hepatic decompensation, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. We performed a systematic review of the effects of the SVR on liver-related hepatic outcomes and found the SVR to be durable (range, 98.4%-100%). An SVR reduced liver-related mortality among patients with chronic hepatitis C (3.3- to 25-fold), the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (1.7- to 4.2-fold), and hepatic decompensation (2.7- to 17.4-fold). An SVR can lead to regression of fibrosis and cirrhosis, and has been associated with a reduced rate of hepatic decompensation, a reduced risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, and reduced liver-related mortality.
