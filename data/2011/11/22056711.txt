This patient is a male in his 30's. He was diagnosed as hepatitis B virus-related huge primary liver cancer, 10cm in diameter, located in segment 4, accompanied with left portal thrombus and multiple lung metastases. Ten months after repeating systemic chemotherapy using gemcitabine (GEM)+carboplatin (CBDCA)+5-FU/leucovorin (LV) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) 4 times, extended left lobectomy with caudate lobe could be successfully performed because of marked reducion of the huge tumor. The pathology revealed almost entirely necrotic changes of the main tumor, and the remaining, viable tumor nests showed combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma. Systemic chemotherapy was repeatedly given afterwards, which kept the pulmonary metastases stable without growth. The present case suggests that systemic chemotherapy using GEM+CBDCA+5-FU/LV may be useful in the multimodal treatment for the combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma with distant metastases.
