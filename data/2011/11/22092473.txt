Aim:Periodontitis induces overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This state increases circulating ROS levels and may affect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The Japan Integrated Stage (JIS) score is a novel staging system for HCC. The objective of the present study was to compare JIS scores in HCC patients with and without periodontitis.Material and methods:We recruited 64 HCC patients comprising 31 chronic periodontitis subjects (HCC + P) and 33 periodontally healthy controls (HCC + H). Their JIS scores were recorded. Serum levels of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) from HCC + P, HCC + H and healthy age- and gender-matched subjects with healthy gingiva (control, n = 15) were also assessed for circulating ROS levels.Results:The HCC + P and HCC + H groups had similar body mass index, habitual drinking and tobacco exposure data. The HCC + P group showed higher JIS scores than the HCC + H group (p = 0.027). Both the HCC + P and HCC + H groups had higher serum levels of ROM than controls (p Conclusion:HCC patients with periodontitis had higher JIS score and circulating ROS level than HCC patients without periodontitis.
