Purposes:This study is aimed at evaluating diagnostic value of focal liver lesions (FLLs) with SonoVue(®)-enhanced ultrasound compared with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI).Methods:PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register were searched for English language articles published from January 2000 to May 2011. Histopathologic analysis and/or close clinical and imaging follow-up (except CECT or CEMRI) for at least 6 months were used as golden reference. Sensitivity, specificity, summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC) were extracted to test heterogeneity.Results:In 21 included studies, for the SonoVue(®)-enhanced ultrasound studies, sensitivity was 88% (95% CI 87-90), specificity was 81% (95% CI 79-84), and 38.62 (95% CI 13.64-109.35) for diagnostic odds ratio (DOR); for the CECT studies, sensitivity was 90% (95% CI 88-92), specificity was 77% (95% CI 71-82), and 30.84 (95% CI 11.11-85.61) for DOR; for the CEMRI studies, sensitivity was 86% (95% CI 83-88), specificity was 81% (95% CI 76-85), and 27.63 (95% CI 11.28-67.70) for DOR.Conclusions:In comparison, SonoVue(®)-enhanced ultrasound had high pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity. SROC analysis showed the diagnostic value of FLLs with SonoVue(®)-enhanced ultrasound has no significant difference compared with CECT and CEMRI. SonoVue(®)-enhanced ultrasound is highly sensitive and specific in the characterization of FLLs to support an effective diagnostic method.
