Background:The outcome after a repeat hepatectomy for recurrent colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is not well defined. The present study examined the morbidity, mortality and long-term survivals after a repeat hepatectomy for recurrent CLM.Methods:Data on patients who underwent surgery for recurrent CLM between 1993 and 2009 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation at the time of first treatment or at recurrence of CLM were excluded.Results:Forty-three patients underwent a repeat hepatectomy for recurrent CLM. At the time of recurrence, patients had a median of 1 (1-3) lesions and the median tumour size was 2 (0.5-8.7) cm. The post-operative morbidity and mortality rates were 12% and 0%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 33 months from a repeat hepatectomy, 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 73% and 22%, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, the largest initial CLM â‰¥5 cm and positive surgical margins at initial resection were independently associated with a worse survival after surgery for recurrent CLM. Positive surgical margins at repeat hepatectomy were a predictive factor for an increased risk of further recurrence.Discussion:A repeat hepatectomy for recurrent CLM was associated with excellent survival, low morbidity and no mortality. Surgeon-controlled variables, including margin-negative resection at first and repeat hepatectomy, contribute to good oncological outcome.
