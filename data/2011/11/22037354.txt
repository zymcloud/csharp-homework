The purpose of this study is to analyze the safety and clinical efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with portal vein stent and ¹²⁵I implantation for the treatment of portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in hepatocellular carcinoma. Fifty-six patients from our department diagnosed with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT between January 2008 and December 30, 2010 were divided into two groups. Patients in Group A were treated with TACE and portal vein stent; patients in Group B were treated with TACE, portal vein stent and ¹²⁵I implantation. The success rate of TACE with portal vein stent and ¹²⁵I implantation was 100%, with no severe surgery-related complications. After an 8 mo follow-up, the total clinical benefit rates were 56.7 and 88.5% for Groups A and B, respectively (p 0.05), but the 12 and 18 mo rates did (p
