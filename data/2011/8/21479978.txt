Aims:To compare selective and non-selective TACE techniques in the treatment of HCC with a special emphasis on clinical and liver tolerance, tumour response and survival.Methods:184 patients with advanced HCC were retrospectively included. Three different TACE techniques were compared: non selective lipiodol-chemotherapy + non selective embolisation (TACE-technique group 1), non selective lipiodol-chemotherapy + selective embolisation (group 2), and selective lipiodol-chemotherapy + selective embolisation (group 3).Results:In multivariate analysis TACE-technique group is an independently significant prognostic factor for poor clinical tolerance, poor liver tolerance and tumour response. The rate of patients with poor clinical tolerance was lower in group 3 (27.0%) than in groups 1 (64.1%, p Conclusion:Both selective techniques resulted in better tumour response. As for improving tolerance, our study suggests that the main technical factor is the use of selective lipiodol-chemotherapy injection.
