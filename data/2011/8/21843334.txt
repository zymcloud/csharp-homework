Background:Single-nucleotide polymorphisms within TP53 gene (codon 72 exon 4, rs1042522, encoding either arginine or proline) and MDM2 promoter (SNP309; rs2279744), have been independently associated with increased risk of several cancer types. Few studies have analysed the role of these polymorphisms in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Genotype distribution of TP53 codon 72 and MDM2 SNP309 in 61 viral hepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 122 blood samples (healthy controls) from Italian subjects were determined by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).Results:Frequencies of TP53 codon 72 alleles were not significantly different between cases and controls. A significant increase of MDM2 SNP309 G/G and T/G genotypes were observed among hepatocellular carcinoma cases (Odds Ratio, OR = 3.56, 95% Confidence Limits, 95% CI = 1.3-9.7; and OR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.3-6.4, respectively).Conclusions:These results highlight a significant role of MDM2 SNP309 G allele as a susceptibility gene for the development of viral hepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma among Italian subjects.
