Pathological studies of explanted cirrhotic livers have made it possible to define precisely the principal morphological characteristics of the transitional stages of the regenerative nodule to dysplastic nodule to hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of our study was to examine the imaging features of histologically proven dysplastic nodules and to compare them with their histopathological features. A large majority (63%) of the dysplastic nodules in our series was hypervascular and 16% had the classic appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Even if the management of a high-grade dysplastic nodule differs little from that of a hepatocellular carcinoma, it is important to remember that not all hypervascular nodules in a cirrhotic liver are necessarily a hepatocellular carcinoma or a high-grade dysplastic nodule.
