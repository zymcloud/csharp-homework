To date, protein profiles for hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas have not been systematically evaluated and compared with each other in an unbiased way. Thirty-six hepatocellular carcinomas and adjacent normal tissue samples were analyzed using histology-directed, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS). Four cholangiocarcinomas and adjacent normal tissue samples were also evaluated. Tissue samples were sectioned at 10 Âµm, with 1-3 sections thaw-mounted on a conductive indium tin oxide-coated glass slide. Sinapinic acid was manually deposited on areas of each tissue section enriched by epithelial cells, either tumor or normal, and mass spectra were acquired using a MALDI-time of flight instrument. According to class prediction analysis, average prediction accuracy in test sets (composed of 18 hepatocellular carcinoma-normal pairs) ranged from 93.0 to 95.8%. Cholangiocarcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas had different protein profiles, as evidenced by average prediction accuracy of >95% in the test set for all classifiers. Permutation P-values for 0.632 + bootstrap cross validated misclassification rates (at feature selection P
