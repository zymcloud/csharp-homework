High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive method that can cause complete coagulation necrosis without requiring the insertion of any instruments. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HIFU treatment for small liver cancers without performing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or rib resection. HIFU ablation was performed without rib resection or the aid of TACE or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) in 12 patients with hepatocelullar carcinoma. The HIFU system (Chongqing Haifu Tech, Chongqing, China) was used under ultrasound guidance. All 12 patients completed the treatment without experiencing any adverse events. Complete coagulation was achieved by applying the sonications from the intercostal space when the tumor was located in the right lobe. After treatment, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were significantly higher than the baseline values; these levels recovered within 1 week. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels increased 1 week after treatment but decreased within 1 month. An epidural anesthetic provided sufficient pain suppression during the procedure. Edema of the subcutaneous tissue was detected in five cases, but the edema disappeared within 1 month. None of the patients developed acute hepatic failure, liver abscess or renal dysfunction. In conclusion, HIFU is effective for the treatment of patients with small liver cancer.
