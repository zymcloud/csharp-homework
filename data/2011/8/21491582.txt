We investigated the phenotype of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in livers removed during transplantation after local ablation therapy by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). This study involved 80 HCC nodules (40 treated with TACE and 40 not treated with local ablation before transplantation) observed in 64 explanted livers and included clinicopathological evaluations as well as single and double immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for cytokeratin 19 (CK19), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and CD133. HCCs with complete necrosis post-TACE without viable tumors were excluded from the analysis. Cholangiolar, glandular, or spindle cell areas suggestive of a mixed hepatocholangiocellular phenotype were seen in 14 post-TACE HCCs and in none of the non-TACE HCCs (P
