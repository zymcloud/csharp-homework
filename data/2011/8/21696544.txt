Here we show that the larger the amount of glutamine added to the medium, the more the expression of genes related to lipid homeostasis is promoted by the activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) at the transcriptional and post-translational levels in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Glutamine increases the mRNA levels of several SREBP targets, including SREBP-2. The gene expression of SREBP-1a, a predominant form of SREBP-1 in most cultured cells and a target of the general transcription factor Sp1, is significantly augmented by glutamine via an increased binding of Sp1 to the SREBP-1a promoter. In contrast, the increased expression of SREBP targets including SREBP-2 is due to stimulation of the processing of SREBP proteins by glutamine. It is also shown that glutamine accelerates SREBP processing through increased transport of the SREBP/SREBP cleavage-activating protein complex from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The processing of activating transcription factor 6 is activated by the same proteases as SREBPs in the Golgi in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and is not induced by glutamine. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that glutamine brings about not only the induction of SREBP-1a transcription but also the stimulation of SREBP processing, thereby facilitating the gene expression of SREBP targets in cultured cells.
