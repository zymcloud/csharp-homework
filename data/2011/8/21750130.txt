Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) is a rare pancreatic tumour with a favourable prognosis compared with the more common ductal adenocarcinoma. The radiological findings of this tumour have been described in the literature; however, only limited data are available regarding the metastatic features of ACC of the liver, the most common metastatic site. We report a case of ACC of the pancreas with a hepatic metastasis from a benign-appearing malignant pancreatic lesion.
