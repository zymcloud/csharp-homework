Introduction:Single port access laparoscopic redo liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis through a single transumbilical skin incision has not been reported in the literature so far.Methods:A wedge resection of segment III lesion with a laparoendoscopic single site surgical incision is described in detail analyzing the technical aspects of the procedure.Results:There were no intraoperative complications with no intraoperative or perioperative blood transfusions. A Pringle maneuver was not used. Operating time was 130 minutes. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on the second postoperative day. The surgical resection margin was not invaded and had a width of 1.8 cm.Conclusions:In this case report, we found that liver resection performed by laparoendoscopic single site surgery for peripherally located hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis seems a feasible technique. Such technique is technically demanding and should be undertaken only with proper training and in high volume centers, by surgeons with expertize in both liver and advanced laparoscopic surgery.
