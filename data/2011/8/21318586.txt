Background:Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) is an anti-tumor agent that can induce differentiation in human cancer cells. Recent evidence indicates that side population (SP) cells possess characteristics of stem-like cells, and may be capable of initiating tumor growth.Aims:The present study investigated the differentiation of cancer stem-like cells derived from hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods and results:Flow cytometry was used to isolated SP cells from HCC cell line (MHCC97 cells). These SP cells exhibit several stem-like cell characteristics that are distinct from the main population (MP) cells in vitro. After 3 days of induction with a low concentration of HCPT, the SP cells lost their capacity to proliferate and invade, and their tumorigenicity declined. Based on real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we also found that the expression of hepatocyte-specific markers such as Î±-fetoprotein, albumin, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 and miR-122 gradually changed during the differentiation of SP cells.Conclusions:Our data suggest that a low concentration of HCPT can induce hepatocyte-specific differentiation of cancer stem-like cells from MHCC97 cells, offering a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human malignancies.
