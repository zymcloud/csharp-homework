Background:The prognostic role of diabetes mellitus (DM) coexisting with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. To clarify its impact on survival in HCC patients after curative treatments, a meta-analysis was performed.Data sources:Eligible studies were identified through multiple search strategies in the databases PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and ACP Journal Club between January 1950 and March 2010. Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and data were aggregated comparing overall survival and recurrence-free survival in HCC patients according to DM status.Results:The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) estimate for overall survival was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.18-1.51; PConclusion:HCC patients with coexisting DM have a shorter survival time and a higher risk for tumor recurrence after curative treatments, while the precise value should be defined in more clinical trials with consistent methodology, especially prospective studies.
