Objective:The purpose of this study was to assess the technical feasibility and local efficacy of biplane fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Method:Our retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was waived. 18 patients with 19 HCCs (mean 2.5 cm diameter; range 2-4.2 cm) were treated with percutaneous RF ablation combined with TACE. After segmental TACE, 18 (95%) of 19 HCCs were visible on fluoroscopy. Shortly (median 2 days; range 1-4 days) after TACE, percutaneous RF ablation was performed under real-time biplane fluoroscopic guidance. We evaluated major complications, rate of technical success at immediate post-RF ablation CT images and local tumour progression at follow-up CT images.Results:Major complication was not observed in any patients. Technical success was achieved for all 18 visible HCCs. During the follow-up period (median 20 months; range 5-30 months), no local tumour progression was found.Conclusion:Biplane fluoroscopy-guided RF ablation combined with TACE is technically feasible and effective for treatment of HCC.
