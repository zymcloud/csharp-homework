Objective:To explore the alone and joint diagnostic value of serum golgi protein 73 (GP73), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and the percentage of lectin-reactive aipha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) of primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC), and provide a novel method for diagnosis for PHC and screening for high-risk population.Methods:ELISA was used to detect the serum level of GP73, AFP and AFP-L3% in 81 cases of PHC,176 cases chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, 30 cases other tumber cancer and 40 cases of health people.Results:The sensitivity of GP73, AFP and AFP-L3% in PHC is 77.78%, 62.69% and 51.85%, and the specificity is 84.55%, 86.99% and 96.34%, respectively. Joint detection could increase the sensitivity up to 88.89%.Conclusion:GP73 was a high sensitivity mark for dignosis of PHC, while AFP-L3% was a high specificity mark for dignosis of PHC. The joint detection could improve PHC diagnostic performance.
