Background:The role of somatostatin analogues in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of octreotide on the survival of patients with advanced HCC.Material/methods:Electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Cochrane controlled trials register, Web of Science and PubMed (updated to Dec 2010) and manual bibliographical searches were conducted. A meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing octreotide versus placebo or no treatment was performed.Results:Eleven RCTs including 802 patients were assessed and 9 were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that the 6-mo and 12-mo survival rates in the octreotide group were significantly higher than those of the control group (6-mo: RR 1.41, 95%CI 1.12-1.77, P=0.003; 12-mo: RR 2.66, 95%CI 1.30-5.44, P=0.008). When including the studies using no treatment as control, with high quality, being performed in China, including >50 patients and with follow-up >2 years, the sensitivity analyses tended to confirm the primary meta-analysis. Whereas, when including the studies using placebo as control or being performed in western countries, the difference was not significant.Conclusions:This meta-analysis demonstrates that octreotide could improve the survival of patients with advanced HCC, but possibly not in western countries. The role of detecting SSTR expression in the administration of octreotide in advanced HCC needs further investigation.
