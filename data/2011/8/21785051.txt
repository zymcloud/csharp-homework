Objective:Primary hepatobiliary malignancies consist of hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancer. Benign hepatic lesions include hepatic cysts, hemagiomas, adenomas, and focal nodular hyperplasias. The utility of PET/CT in imaging primary hepatobiliary lesions varies according to the type and location of the lesion.Conclusion:There is a consistent benefit to the use of PET/CT for detection and staging, and it ultimately helps to establish the best course of treatment and to determine prognosis. In addition, PET/CT is very useful in local ablative and systemic therapy assessment and surveillance for hepatobiliary malignancies.
