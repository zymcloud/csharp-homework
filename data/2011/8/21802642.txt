Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-2, and endostatin have been reported to be related with angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The potential feasibility of serial serum VEGF-A, angiopoietin-2, and endostatin measurements in cirrhotic patients with HCC treated by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was investigated. VEGF-A, angiopoietin-2, and endostatin serum level were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 1 day before and 7 days after TACE in 40 patients. Then they were followed up for 3 months. The results showed that TACE could cause significant increase of VEGF-A (p 0.1). Twenty-five patients with rapid growth of HCC within 3 months after TACE had higher proportion of American Joint Committee on Cancer HCC staging >II and higher increase of VEGF-A after TACE than 15 patients without rapid growth (all p 16.7 pg/mL 7 days after TACE selected by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (p
