Background:The simultaneous incremental increase in incidence of both obesity and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will soon lead to more overweight and obese patients with cirrhosis needing surgery. At present, little is known about postoperative mortality and morbidity in such patients. This study investigated outcomes after hepatectomy in relation to obesity in a homogeneous cohort of patients with cirrhosis.Methods:Perioperative data from 235 patients with cirrhosis who had hepatectomy for HCC were related to the presence of normal bodyweight (body mass index (BMI) 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) and obesity (BMI at least 30 kg/m(2)). Complications after surgery were graded according to the expanded Accordion Severity Classification of Postoperative Complications (T92).Results:One hundred and one patients (43.0 per cent) were of normal bodyweight, 88 (37.4 per cent) were overweight and 46 (19.6 per cent) were obese; none was underweight. Overweight and obese groups showed a male preponderance (P = 0.024), and metabolic disorders were frequently the cause of cirrhosis in these patients (P Conclusion:Hepatic resection can be performed safely in overweight and obese patients with cirrhosis, although morbidity is increased in these patients.
