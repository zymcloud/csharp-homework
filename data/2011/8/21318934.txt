The impact of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a local ablative tumor therapy is increasing. Randomized trials justify RFA for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (single tumor ≤ 5 cm or three or less tumors ≤ 3 cm). Surgical resection still remains the gold standard for resectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Several single center trials demonstrate improved patient survival by RFA and justify RFA for non-resectable CRLM. Local recurrence increases significantly with tumor diameters > 3 cm. There is insufficient evidence at this time to resolve the issue of optimal approach for treatment of CRLM. Technical development of the electrode design, improved ablation algorithms, and simplification of the exact electrode placement by new real-time fusion techniques of pre-interventional CT or MRT images with intra-interventional ultrasound have the potential to reduce the variable and sometimes high rate of local tumor recurrence. The clinical impact of immunological aspects following RFA with regard to patient survival and local tumor recurrence remains unclear.
