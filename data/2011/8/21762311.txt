Introduction:Registration studies showed entecavir (ETV) to be effective and safe in NUC-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), but its effectiveness in routine clinical practice is unknown.Materials and methods:Sixty-nine HBeAg positive and negative NUC naïve chronic HBV patients were treated with ETV for 110 weeks. 63% were HBeAg positive, 16% were cirrhotics, mean HBV-DNA was 7.09 log IU/ml and mean ALT was 157 IU/ml.Results:Sixty-one (88%) patients achieved undetectable DNA, with 46%, 77% and 100% virological response rates at week 24, 48 and 96 of treatment, respectively. Thirty-seven (84%) patients in the HBeAg-positive population achieved undetectable DNA, with 67% and 100% virological response rates at week 48 and 96 of treatment, respectively. Twenty-four (96%) patients in the HBeAg-negative population achieved undetectable DNA, with 91% and 100% virological response rates at week 48 and 96 of treatment, respectively. Twenty-three (53%) patients cleared HBeAg and 19 (44%) patients seroconverted to antiHBe positive status; seven (10%) patients cleared hepatitis B surface antigen and five (7%) patients developed antiHBs. At the end of the study, 10 patients successfully stopped therapy: nine HBeAg positive (four developed antiHBs positive) and one HBeAg negative. None of the patients had primary non-response. ETV resistance was not tested. None of the patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent liver transplantation or died because of liver-related events. No serious adverse events were reported.Conclusion:The ETV monotherapy showed high virological response rates, a favourable safety profile for NUC-naive HBeAg-positive and negative patients treated in routine clinical practice.
