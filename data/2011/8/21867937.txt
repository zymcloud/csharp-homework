Individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at risk for cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment of HCV infection has undergone several revisions over the past 15 years and continues to evolve. The current major advance is with the protease inhibitors in addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The emergence of resistance needs to be monitored carefully as newer and more potent drugs are added to the interferon and ribavirin backbone drugs. In addition, adverse events will be more frequent and some novel ones will require special attention.
