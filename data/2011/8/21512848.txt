Clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes were analyzed retrospectively.Results:Patients in the NAFLD group were older (P Conclusions:Surgical resection may provide a survival benefit for patients with NAFLD-related HCC. Patients with NASH-related cirrhosis undergoing major hepatic resection should be treated carefully.
