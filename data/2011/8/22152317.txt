To investigate the relationship and significance of Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway with caspase-3, XIAP, HSP27and Grp-78. The HCC cell line HepG2 was transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against b-catenin. After 72 and 96 h, protein was extracted and the protein expressions of b-catenin, caspase-3, XIAP, Grp-78 and HSP27 were detected by Western blot. b-catenin protein expression was inhibited at both time points and the expression at 96 h was higher than that at 72 h (F = 160.72, P is less than to 0.01). Interestingly, Caspase-3 protein expression was decreased at 72 h and increased to normal at 96 h (F = 136.10, P is less than to 0.01), while p-caspase-3 protein expression increased at 72 h and decreased to normal at 96 h (F = 98.65, P is less than to 0.01). XIAP protein expression decreased at 72 h (F = 37.29, P is less than to 0.01) and increased at 96 h. Grp-78 protein expression increased at 72 h and decreased to normal at 96 h ( F = 58.72, P is less than to 0.01). HSP27 protein expression showed no change following transfection ( F = 1.91, P is more than to 0.05). Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway is related to the protein expressions of caspase-3, XIAP and Grp-78, but not related to HSP27 protein expression in HCC. Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway may participate in the regulation of HCC apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation through affecting these factors.
