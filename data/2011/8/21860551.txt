We performed a retrospective review of 281 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) treated with radiation therapy (RT) between 1998 and 2008 to develop a prognostic model for those patients. Of the 281 patients, PVTT and intrahepatic main masses completely disappeared in 10 patients (3.6%), and shown a partial response in 141 patients (50.2%). The median survival was 11.6 months. Patients who had more than PR have shown significantly longer survival than the others (22.0 months vs 5.0 months, P
