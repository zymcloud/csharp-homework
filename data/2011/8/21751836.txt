The derivatives of hyperforin, namely hyperforin acetate (2), 17,18,22,23,27,28,32,33-octahydrohyperforin acetate (3), and N,N-dicyclohexylamine salt of hyperforin (4), have been investigated for their antitumor properties. In-vitro studies demonstrated that 2 and 4 were active against HeLa (human cervical cancer), A375 (human malignant melanoma), HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), MCF-7 (human breast cancer), A549 (human nonsmall cell lung cancer), K562 (human chronic myeloid leukemia), and K562/ADR (human adriamycin-resistant K562) cell lines with IC(50) values in the range of 3.2-64.1 Î¼M. The energy differences between highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of 2-4 were calculated to be 0.39778, 0.43106, and 0.30900 a.u., respectively, using the Gaussian 03 software package and ab initio method with the HF/6-311 G* basis set. The result indicated that the biological activity of 4 might be the strongest and that of 3 might be the weakest, which was in accordance with their corresponding antiproliferative effects against the tested tumor cell lines. Compound 4 caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in flow cytometry experiment and induced apoptosis by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI (propidium iodide) double-labeled staining in HepG2 cells. The results indicated a potential for N,N-dicyclohexylamine salt of hyperforin as a new antitumor drug.
