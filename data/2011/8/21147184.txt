Background & aims:Recurrence of hepatocellular cancer after resection is a significant problem. The optimal treatment of patients with intrahepatic recurrence after resection and well-preserved liver function is not clear. We analyzed the outcomes of patients undergoing a second hepatic resection for recurrent hepatocellular cancer at a single Western center.Methods:The records of all patients undergoing primary hepatic resection for hepatocellular cancer between January 1994 and January 2009 were reviewed. Patients with a single intrahepatic recurrence, Child's A liver function, and platelet count>100,000/Î¼l underwent a second hepatic resection. Clinical data was recorded and analyzed.Results:Of the 487 patients undergoing primary resection, 221 developed recurrence, and 35 underwent a second hepatic resection. There were no perioperative mortalities. There were 10 deaths during the study period; 5-year overall survival was 67% from second resection. Time to recurrence from primary resection1 year from primary resection and without gross vascular invasion had a 5-year survival of 81%. There were 17 recurrences with a 3-year recurrence rate of 55%.Conclusions:Second hepatic resection for recurrent hepatocellular cancer is applicable in about 15% of patient with recurrence. The procedure is safe and can achieve excellent results in well-selected patients. Recurrence continues to be a significant problem.
