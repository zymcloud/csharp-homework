Objectives:To evaluate the minimally invasive incision to the recipient of a liver transplant.Materials and methods:A 55-year-old man with cirrhosis due to hepatitis B accompanied by hepatocellular carcinoma underwent a right lobe, living-donor liver transplant using an 18-cm long, upper midline incision. The recipient hepatectomy was performed from the left to the right side (from medial to lateral). Deep retractors and long surgical instruments were preferred.Results:The surgical procedure was completed without problem. Both the recipient hepatectomy and implantation of the right liver took 8 hours. Postoperative recovery of the patient was rapid, and he was discharged 8 days after surgery, uneventfully.Conclusions:An upper midline incision can be preferred for liver transplant for selected cases. Minimally invasive surgery is an option for liver transplant recipients as well.
