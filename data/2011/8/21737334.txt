Purpose:To assess the acute toxicity of intensity modulated radiotherapy as post-operative adjuvant treatment for retroperitoneal sarcoma.Patients and methods:Patients who received adjuvant intensity modulated radiotherapy from January 2009 to September 2010 were retrospectively reviewed.Results:Fourteen patients entered the study (seven primary tumours and seven relapses). All tumours were liposarcoma and had macroscopically complete resection, epiploplasty was systematically realized. Median tumour size was 21 cm (range: 15-45), median planning target volume was 580 cm(3) (range: 329-1172) and median prescribed dose was 50.4 Gy (range: 45-54). Median follow-up was 11.5 months (range: 2-21.4). Acute toxicity was mild: acute digestive toxicity grade 1-2 occurred in 12/14 patients (86%). However, there was no weight loss of more than 5% during radiotherapy and no treatment interruption was required. Two months after completion of radiotherapy, digestive toxicity grade 1 remained present in 1/14 patients (7%). One case of grade 3 toxicity occurred during follow-up (transient abdominal pain). Three relapses occurred: two were outside treaded volume and one was both in and outside treated volume.Conclusions:Intensity modulated radiotherapy in the postoperative setting of retroperitoneal sarcoma provides low acute toxicity. Longer follow-up is needed to assess late toxicity, especially for bowel, kidney and radio-induced malignancies.
