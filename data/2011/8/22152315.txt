To study the expressions of CD34 and CD117 in the tissues of hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) and to explore the relationship with clinical pathology and it's evaluation on the prognosis of HCC patients. The expressions of CD34 and CD117 were examined by two-step methods of PV-9000 of immunohistochemistry in 55 HCC cases, 10 liver cirrhotic specimens and 6 normal liver specimens. Clinical-pathological data, tumor recurrent rate and survival rate after hepatectomy were recorded and analyzed with Fisher's Exact Test, Pearson X2 Test, Kaplan-Meier, Log-Rank Test and Cox Regression. The positive expression of CD34 was found in 65.4% of HCC, 20% of cirrhostic liver specimens and 16.7% of normal liver specimens, respectively. Significant differences found among the three groups, and the CD34 expression was significantly associated with vessel embolus (X2 = 4.000, P = 0.046) and the histological grades (X2 = 11.008, P = 0.001). The positive expression of CD117 was 47.3%, 10% and 0% in HCC, cirrhotic liver specimens and normal liver tissues, respectively, and statistical differences esxisted among the three groups. The CD117 expression was dramatically related to the histological grades (X2 = 5.115, P = 0.024) and clinical stages (X2 = 15.459, P = 0.000). Median disease free survival time after hepatectomy was significantly shorter in the group with positive-expression of CD34 (X2 = 4.105, P = 0.043) and CD117 (X2 = 28.023, P = 0.000) than the negative-expressed groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that CD117 expression status, serum AFP levels and the size of tumor were independently prognostic factors for HCC patients. Tthe results demonstrated that CD34 and CD117 might play an important role in liver carcinogenesis and the progression of HCC, and they might potentially serve as markers for HCC prognosis.
