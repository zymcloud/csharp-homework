Aim:To evaluate the significance of autologous blood transfusion (AT) in reducing homologous blood transfusion (HT) in surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The proportion of patients who received HT was compared between two groups determined by the time of AT introduction; period A (1991-1994, n = 93) and period B (1995-2000, n = 201). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify independent significant predictors of the need for HT. We also investigated the impact of AT and HT on long-term postoperative outcome after curative surgery for HCC.Results:The proportion of patients with HT was significantly lower in period B than period A (18.9% vs 60.2%, P Conclusion:AT administration significantly decreased the need for HT. Considering the postoperative survival disadvantage of HT, AT administration could improve the long-term outcome of HCC patients.
