While hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a relatively common tumour with an annual incidence in the EU of 8 cases/100,000 inhabitants, bile tract carcinoma (BTC) is much less common, with an incidence of 4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. In both cases, when planning treatment it is essential to perform accurate staging, evaluate hepatic functional reserve and performance status, and obtain the opinion of the patient. The only curative treatment is surgery. However, several interventional radiological techniques can help to achieve local disease control and the alleviation of symptoms. In addition, sorafenib (HCC) and chemotherapy (BTC) may contribute to prolong survival in patients with disseminated disease. Therefore, the therapeutic strategy should always be discussed and planned within a multidisciplinary tumour board.
