Objective:To compare the difference of HBV DNA levels and HBV genotypes between the patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis who infected with hepatitis B virus.Methods:Total 430 patients with hepatitis B were enrolled and further divided into the HCC group (210 cases) and liver cirrhosis group (HBV LC, 220 cases). The levels of HBV DNA and HBV genotypes were detected in all of the serum samples from the two groups, and the differences in the genotypes and virological markers between HCC patients and HBV LC patients were further analyzed.Results:The positive rates of HBV DNA of HCC patients and HBV LC patients were 84.3% (177/210) and 94. 5% (208/220), respectively. The mean values of serum HBV DNA in HCC patients and HBV-LC patients were (5.06 +/- 1.01) log10 cps/ml and (5.36 +/- 1.13) log10 cps/ml, respectively. The positive rates of HBV DNA and the mean values of serum HBV DNA were higher in HBV-LC patients than those in HCC patients (P Conclusions:Mainly presented as a C genotype in both groups, the total levels of serum HBV DNA in HCC patients were lower than those in HBV-LC patients.
