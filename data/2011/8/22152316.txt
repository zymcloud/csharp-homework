To investigate the mechanism and biologic effects of 37 nm magnetic nano FeOx powders (MNPs) on human hepatoma-bearing nude mice. 37 nm MNPs were prepared by coprecipitation methods and then injected into human hepatoma (Bel-7402) bearing-nude mice through the tail vein. After injection of MNPs, the mice were first exposed under static magnetic field and then treated under extremely low frequency altering-electric magnetic field directing to the tumor area. The migration and trafficking of MNPs were determined by MMR. Tumor growth was monitored with calipers every 5 days and tumor volume was calculated on the basis of three-dimensioned measurements. The apoptosis of tumor cells was analyzed by flow cytometry analysis. The expressions of apoptosis-associated proteins Bcl-2, Bax and HSP27 were determined using western-blot analysis. Static magnetic field could direct the migration and trafficking of MNPs to the tumor site with a higher ratio of 98.9%. Extremely Low Frequency Electric-Magnetic Field (EMF) treatment could inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and prolong the survive time of tumor-bearing mice injected with MNPs. In addition, the survival time of tumor-bearing mice and percentages of prohibition on tumor cell growth were 27.4+/-0.7 days and 37.5+/-0.8% (F = 0.005, P is less than to 0.05), respectively. The results of flow cytometry analyses showed that about 18.1+/-0.6% (F = 0.030, P is less than to 0.05) of tumor cells were induced into early apoptosis. Furthermore, expressions of apoptosis-associated proteins Bcl-2 and Bax were significantly induced by MNPs under EMF treatment. The ratio of Bcl/Bax in both MNPs and EMF treatment group was 0.07+/-0.01, which was much lower than that of control group (0.23+/-0.02) (F = 0.016, P is less than to 0.05). Heat shock protein-27 (Hsp-27) was not significantly induced in different treatment groups. Injection of MNPs with EMF exposure on human hepatoma-bearing nude mice could significantly prolong the survival time, inhibit the tumor proliferation and growth, and induce tumor cells into apoptosis.
