Introduction:The number of patients suffering from primary and secondary liver tumoral diseases is on the increase worldwide. The development of new technologies and drugs requires an increasingly multidisciplinary approach in the management of these diseases. Therapies should be based on scientifically supported guidelines and at the same time should be designed to suit the individual patient. In this decision-making process, an understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of every treatment is very important. The efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in improving survival and its role in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been demonstrated in several clinical trials. The introduction of drug-eluting beads seems to have overcome some of the limitations of conventional TACE.Areas covered:This review provides an overview of the spread of primary and secondary liver cancers, then it explains the basis for the use of conventional TACE and its potential benefits and, finally, outlines its clinical application and possible future uses.Expert opinion:The management of the treatment of focal liver lesions is a difficult process, which must involve various specialists such as the interventional radiologist. The use of drug-eluting microspheres seems to improve the results of TACE both in HCC and in colorectal liver metastases.
