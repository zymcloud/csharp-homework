Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. In recent decades, significant progress toward understanding the molecular virology and pathogenesis of HBV infection has been made. In addition, multiple treatment modalities have been developed for persons with HBV infection. In the present study, we demonstrated that IL-4 inhibits the expression of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen in a HBV stably transfected hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2.2.15). To reveal the anti-HBV mechanism of IL-4 by proteomics, 2-DE and MS technology were utilized to profile global changes in protein expression in HepG2.2.15 cells after IL-4 treatment. A total of 56 differentially expressed proteins were identified in IL-4-treated HepG2.2.15 cells. To find out the interaction of these changed proteins by bioinformatics, signaling network analysis with the STRING tool showed that the identified proteins are primarily involved in transcription and proteolysis. Taken together, these results offer valuable clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the IL-4-mediated anti-HBV response.
