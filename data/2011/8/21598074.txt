Olaquindox, a synthetic antimicrobial compound, was banned as feed additives in the U.S. and the EU. In China, the use of olaquindox is banned in poultry and aquaculture feed, restricted in livestock feed for growth promotion. Olaquindox's safety is the object of increasing attention. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether and how olaquindox elevates expression of c-Myc, which influences olaquindox-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. For a better understanding of c-Myc's role in susceptibility of human hepatoma G2 cells to olaquindox-induced apoptosis, two vectors (the pSilencer-cmyc(Si-cmyc) and the control vector) were transfected to HepG2 cells. The cells were pretreated with Si-cmyc, which expressed only 35-65% c-Myc protein levels compared to those of the parental cells and the control cells. We examined effects of olaquindox on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in these c-Myc low-expressing cells, and on apoptosis. Our data revealed that ROS production induced by olaquindox treatment was partially blocked by Si-cmyc transfection and partly inhibited olaquindox-induced apoptosis through decreased ROS generation. Further data showed that olaquindox induced decreased ROS by Si-cmyc transfection through decreased cytochrome c release to cytosol, which inhibited apoptosis of the cells. These results suggest that c-Myc might be important during olaquindox-induced apoptosis in human hepatoma G2 cells.
