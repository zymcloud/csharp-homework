There has been an ongoing search for clinically acceptable methods for the accurate, efficient and simple diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Optical spectroscopy is a technique with potential clinical applications to diagnose cancer diseases. The purpose of this study was to obtain the optical properties of HCC tissues and non-tumorous hepatic tissues and identify the difference between them. A total of 55 tissue samples (HCC tissue, n=38; non-tumorous hepatic tissue, n=17) were surgically resected from patients with HCC. The optical parameters were measured in 10-nm steps using single-integrating-sphere system in the wavelength range of 400 to 1800 nm. It was found that the optical properties and their differences varied with the wavelength for the HCC tissue and the non-tumorous hepatic tissue in the entire wavelength range of research. The absorption coefficient of the HCC tissue (1.48±0.99, 1.46±0.88, 0.86±0.61, 2.15±0.53, 0.54±0.10, 0.79±0.15 mm(-1)) was significantly lower than that of the non-tumorous hepatic tissue (2.79±1.73, 3.13±1.47, 3.06±2.79, 2.57±0.55, 0.62±0.10, 0.93±0.16 mm(-1)) at wavelengths of 400, 410, 450, 1450, 1660 and 1800 nm, respectively (P
