Low portal vein flows in liver transplant have been associated with poor allograft survival. Identifying and ameliorating causes of inadequate portal flow is paramount. We describe successful reversal of significant splenic vein siphon from a spontaneous splenorenal shunt during liver transplant. The patient is a 43-year-old male with cirrhosis from hepatitis C and Budd-Chiari syndrome, who had a variceal hemorrhage necessitating an emergent splenorenal shunt with 8 mm PTFE graft. Imaging in 2006 revealed thrombosis of the splenorenal shunt and evidence of a new spontaneous splenorenal shunt. The patient developed hepatocellular carcinoma and underwent transplant in 2009. After reperfusion, portal flows were low (150-200 mL/min). A mesenteric varix was ligated without improvement. Due to adhesions, direct collateral ligation was not attempted. In order to redirect the splenic siphon, the left renal vein was stapled at its confluence with the inferior vena cava. Portal flows subsequently increased to 1.28 L/min. Postoperatively, the patient had stable renal and liver function. We conclude that spontaneous splenorenal shunts can cause low portal flows. A diligent search for shunts with understanding of flow patterns is critical; ligation or rerouting of splanchnic flow may be necessary to improve portal flows and allograft outcomes.
