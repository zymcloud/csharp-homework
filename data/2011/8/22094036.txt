Objective:To explore the technical success rate, efficacy, overall survival, recurrence-free survival and prognostic factors of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus thermal ablations of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) in the patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Forty-five cases with Child-pugh class A, B cirrhosis and large HCC with a maximum tumor between 5.0 cm to 10.0 cm underwent TACE and thermal ablation. Twenty-five patients received TACE plus RFA while the other 20 patients underwent TACE plus MWA. Their efficacy, long-term survival and prognostic factors were statistically analyzed.Results:TACE plus thermal ablation were performed in 84 tumors with a successful rate of 100% (86/86) and a complete ablation rate of 94.0% (79/84). The major complication rate was 6.7% (3/45). Local and distant recurrence rates were 66.7% (30/45) and 71.1% (32/45) respectively. The 1 and 2-year recurrence-free survival rates were 26.7% (12/45) and 13.3% (6/45). And the 1, 2 and 3-year survival rates were 80.0% (36/45), 33.3% (15/45) and 6.7% (3/45) respectively. Univariate and Cox regression analyses indicated that tumor size > 7.0 cm, multi-nodularity, incomplete necrosis and pretherapy α-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥ 200 µg/L were 4 unfavorable prognostic factors for the long-term survival.Conclusion:The combined procedures of TACE and percutaneous thermal ablation are both safe and effective for the unresectable large HCC (> 5.0 cm). It represents an alleviate treatment for those patients with tumor size > 7.0 cm. Tumor size, tumor number, completeness of necrosis and AFP level are all significant prognostic factors.
