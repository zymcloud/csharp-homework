Background & aims:Many patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis (CC) have other conditions associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that put them at risk for complications that preclude orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Methods:We followed all patients with NASH and CC who were evaluated for OLT (n = 218) at Baylor Simmons Transplant Institute between March 2002 and May 2008. Data were compared with those from patients evaluated for OLT because of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated cirrhosis (n = 646).Results:Patients with NASH and CC were older, more likely to be female, had a higher body mass index, and a greater prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, compared with patients with HCV-associated cirrhosis, but the 2 groups had similar model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores. NASH and CC in patients with MELD scores â‰¤15 were less likely to progress; these patients were less likely to receive OLT and more likely to die or be taken off the wait list because they were too sick, compared with patients with HCV-associated cirrhosis. The median progression rate among patients with NASH and CC was 1.3 MELD points per year versus 3.2 MELD points per year for the HCV group (P = .003). Among patients with MELD scores >15, there were no differences among groups in percentage that received transplants or rate of MELD score progression. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurred in 2.7% of patients with NASH and CC per year, compared with 4.7% per year among those with HCV-associated cirrhosis.Conclusions:Patients with NASH and CC and low MELD scores have slower disease progression than patients with HCV-associated cirrhosis and are less likely to receive OLT.
