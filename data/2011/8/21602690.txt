Chronic hepatitis B continues to be a major global health burden. It accounts for a substantial impact on health care resources and finances in many parts of the world including Europe. Natural history and disease spectrum are varied, depending on when and how the infection is acquired. The chronic infective state increases patients' risk of progression to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Several treatment options are currently available, but their use depends on the stage of the patient's infection, which is influenced by both host and viral factors. The ultimate goals in hepatitis B treatment are to prevent disease progression, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. Patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis should be referred to specialized transplant centers in a timely manner.
