Primary hepatic capillary hemangioma in adults is very rare. Here, we report a case of hepatic capillary hemangioma in a 71-year-old woman. She had abnormal liver function tests, and abdominal sonography revealed a 2-cm nodular lesion and fatty liver. Computed tomography scan revealed a hypervascular tumor. During 2 years' follow-up, the hepatic tumor enlarged to 3 cm in diameter. Serological tests showed no evidence of chronic viral hepatitis or increased level of alpha-fetoprotein. In fear of hepatocellular carcinoma, she received atypical hepatectomy. Microscopically, the tumor turned out to be a capillary hemangioma in a background of steatohepatitis. We searched the literature, and only six similar cases were found. We made a brief review of this rare disease entity and described its clinicopathological features.
