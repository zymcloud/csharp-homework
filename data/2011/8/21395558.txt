βig-h3 is a TGF-β (transforming growth factor β)-induced ECM (extracellular matrix) protein that induces the secretion of MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases). However, the mechanism of induction is yet to be established. In this study, siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) targeted against βig-h3 were transfected into SMMC-7721 cells [a HCC (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cell line] to knockdown the expression of βig-h3. We found that NiCl2, a potent blocker of extracellular Ca2+ entry, reduced βig-h3-induced secretion of MMP-2 and -9. Further investigation suggested that reduction in the levels of βig-h3 decreased the secretion of MMP-2 and -9 that was enhanced by an increase in the concentration of extracellular Ca2+. SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine), a NO (nitric oxide) donor, and 8-Br-cGMP (8-bromo-cGMP) inhibited thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry and MMP secretion in the invasive potential of human SMMC-7721 cells. Further, the inhibitory effects of 8-Br-cGMP and SNAP could be significantly enhanced by down-regulating βig-h3. βig-h3 attenuates the negative regulation of NO/cGMP-sensitive store-operated Ca2+ entry. Our findings suggest that the expression of βig-h3 might play an important role in the regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry to increase the invasive potential of HCC cells.
