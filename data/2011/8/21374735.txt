Aberrant expressions of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor genes have been reported in tumor cells. Here, we measured the expression levels of the Lpa5 gene and its DNA methylation status in rat tumor cells, and investigated cell growth effects of LPA in Lpa5 expressed cells. Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed that increased expressions of the Lpa5 gene were detected in rat liver-derived hepatoma RH7777 and lung-derived adenocarcinoma RLCNR cells. For the analysis of methylation status, bisulfite sequencing was performed with RH7777 and RLCNR cells and compared with other tumor cells and liver epithelial cells. The Lpa5 gene in Lpa5 unexpressed cells and liver epithelial cells were highly methylated in the 5' upstream region. In contrast, the Lpa5 gene in RH7777 and RLCNR cells was unmethylated, correlating with increased expressions of Lpa5. In the assays for cell growth effects of LPA, LPA enhanced cell proliferation and motility in RH7777 and RLCNR cells. LPA also stimulated cell invasion in RLCNR, but not in RH7777 cells. In rat liver and lung tumors induced by nitroso-compounds, 4 out of 6 hepatocellular carcinomas and 5 out of 6 lung adenocarcinomas indicated increased expressions of Lpa5 with unmethylated status. These results suggest that increased Lpa5 expressions due to aberrant DNA methylation may be involved in the acquisition of growth advantage of rat tumor cells.
