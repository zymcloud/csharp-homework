Purpose:To evaluate the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection in serosa-positive gastric cancer, a multicenter phase III clinical trial was conducted in Japan.Patients and methods:From January 1993 to March 1998, 268 patients were randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy (135 patients) or surgery alone (133 patients). All patients underwent gastrectomy with D2 or greater lymph node dissection. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of intraperitoneal cisplatin soon after abdominal closure, postoperative intravenous cisplatin (day 14) and 5-fluorouracil (day 14-16), and daily oral FU (UFT) starting 4 weeks after surgery for 12 months. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Relapse-free survival and site of recurrence were secondary endpoints.Results:Fifty-two patients (38.5%) in the adjuvant chemotherapy arm completed the chemotherapy regimen. There were 4 (1.49%) treatment-related deaths, 1 in the surgery-alone and 3 in the adjuvant chemotherapy arm (2 did not receive chemotherapy). Grade 4 toxicity was observed in 3 patients in the surgery-alone and 2 patients in the adjuvant chemotherapy arm. There was no significant difference in 5-year overall survival (62.0% adjuvant chemotherapy vs. 60.9% surgery-alone, P = 0.482) and 5-year relapse-free survival rates (57.5% adjuvant chemotherapy vs. 55.6% surgery-alone; P = 0.512).Conclusion:There was no benefit in overall and relapse-free survival with this adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients with macroscopically serosa-positive gastric cancer after curative resection.
