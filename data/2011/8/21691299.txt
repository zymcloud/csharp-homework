p28(GANK) (also known as PSMD10 or gankyrin) is a novel oncoprotein that is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Through its interaction with various proteins, p28(GANK) mediates the degradation of the tumor suppressor proteins Rb and p53. Although p53 was reported to downregulate β-catenin, whether p28(GANK) is involved in the regulation of β-catenin remains uncertain. Here we report that both growth factors and Ras upregulate p28(GANK) expression through the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT pathway. Upregulation of p28(GANK) expression subsequently enhanced the transcription activity of β-catenin. This effect was observed in p53-deficient cells, suggesting a p53-independent mechanism for the p28(GANK)-mediated activation of β-catenin. p28(GANK) overexpression also reduced E-cadherin protein levels, leading to increased release of free β-catenin into the cytoplasm from the cadherin-bound pool. Interestingly, exogenous expression of p28(GANK) resulted in elevated expression of the endogenous protein. We also observed that both β-catenin and c-Myc were transcriptional activators of p28(GANK), and a correlation between p28(GANK) overexpression and c-Myc, cyclin D1 and β-catenin activation in primary human HCC. Together, these results suggest that p28(GANK) expression is regulated by a positive feedback loop involving β-catenin, which may play a critical role in tumorigenesis and the progression of HCC.
