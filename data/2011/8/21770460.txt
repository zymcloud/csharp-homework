Liver cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the leading cause of death in human populations. Butein, a tetrahydroxychalcone, has been shown to induce apoptosis in many human cancer cells, but the effects of butein on the migration and invasion of human liver cancer cells are not reported. Herein, we found that butein is effective in the suppression of migration and invasion in SK-HEP-1 human hepatocarcinoma cells by using the Matrigel cell migration assay and invasion system. The gelatin zymography assay indicated that butein inhibited the activity of matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Western blotting analysis indicated that butein decreased the levels of MMP-2, -7, and -9, uPA, Ras, Rho A, ROCK1, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, p-p38, and p-c-Jun in SK-HEP-1 cells. Furthermore, butein inhibited the NF-ÎºB binding activity in SK-HEP-1 cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We also found that butein decreased the ERK, JNK, and p38 in SK-HEP-1 cells by in vitro kinase assay. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that butein might be a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of hepatocarcinoma through inhibiting migration and invasion.
