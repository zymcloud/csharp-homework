Hepatocellular carcinoma has an increasing incidence and high mortality. Treatment options are limited if the disease is not diagnosed in its early stage. The natural course of the disease is aggressive but not always predictable. Molecular profiling is a promising tool for classification in order to optimize prognosis prediction and treatment for an individual patient. In the last decade a large amount of studies has been conducted to better classify hepatocellular carcinomas. The focus of this review is on implications of molecular classification for prognosis and therapeutic decision making in HCC patients. Most studies used microarray technique for genome wide profiling, but other methods to detect genomic changes and microRNA are gaining interest. The whole genome profiling studies identified differences in affected signalling and tried to relate this to prognosis. Some common subgroups were identified, such as the proliferation cluster and the beta-catenin cluster. However, there is still little overlap between most studies. Better study design and bio-informatical analysis might help in this context.
