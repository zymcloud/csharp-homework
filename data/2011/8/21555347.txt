Purpose:To prospectively determine whether fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) early dynamic blood flow estimates could be used to discriminate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from background liver and to characterize HCC in patients with and those without angioinvasion; and to evaluate the association between blood flow measures at FDG PET/CT with metabolism in HCCs.Materials and methods:Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained for this prospective study. Twenty-one consecutive patients (mean age, 65 years) with 30 established HCCs (mean size, 5.5 cm; seven lesions in five patients with angioinvasion) underwent a blood flow study with an FDG dynamic scan divided into 18 sequences of 5 seconds each and a standard PET/CT scan. On the dynamic study, three independent operators obtained volumes of interest (VOIs) for which three blood flow estimates were calculated (hepatic perfusion index [HPI], time to peak [TTP], and peak intensity [PI]). On the late study, a VOI was placed on the fused scan for each HCC, and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) was obtained. By using a mixed-effects model analysis, comparison of blood flow estimates between HCC with and that without angioinvasion and background liver was performed. The association between blood flow estimates and SUV(max) was also assessed.Results:HPI and TTP showed better performance than did SUV(max) for discriminating HCC and background liver (areas under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.96, 0.95, and 0.83, respectively; P Conclusion:Early dynamic blood flow FDG PET/CT may be used to help discriminate and characterize HCC tumors.
