Background:There are limited data on the incidence of afferent limb syndrome and other delayed GI problems in pancreatic cancer (PaC) patients, especially among long-term survivors (>2 years).Objective:To evaluate the incidence of afferent limb syndrome (chronic afferent limb obstruction resulting in pancreatobiliary obstruction) and delayed GI problems in PaC patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).Design:Retrospective case series.Setting:Tertiary referral center.Patients:PaC patients treated with PD (N = 186) over a 14-year period (January 1995-October 2009).Interventions:Endoscopic balloon dilation and stent placement, percutaneous biliary drainage.Main outcome measurements:Incidence of afferent limb syndrome and delayed GI complications (marginal ulcers, radiation enteropathy, anastomotic strictures).Results:Mean age was 63 Â± 10 years; 55% of patients were male. Afferent limb syndrome was noted in 24 patients (13%). Median time to diagnosis was 1.2 years (range 0.03-12.3 years); obstruction was primarily caused by recurrent PaC (8 patients, 33%) and radiation enteropathy (9 patients, 38%). Afferent limb syndrome was more likely to develop in patients with 2 years or longer of follow-up (n = 71, [38%]) compared with patients with 2 years or less of follow-up, after controlling for age, sex, surgery type, and adjuvant treatment (adjusted odds ratio, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.8-11.7). Other delayed GI problems included radiation enteropathy (6%), marginal ulcers (5%), anastomotic strictures (4%), cholangitis/liver abscesses (5%), and GI bleeding (6%).Limitations:Retrospective, single-center study.Conclusions:GI problems, including afferent limb syndrome, are relatively common in PaC patients after surgery and adjuvant therapy. Clinicians should recognize and effectively treat these delayed GI problems, especially in long-term survivors.
