Background:Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15) is a useful marker of liver function in deciding on the extent of hepatectomy. To determine ICGR15 regardless of liver condition, we sought to establish a formula for converted ICGR15 based on conventional blood tests and technetium-99 m galactosyl human serum albumin ((99m)Tc-GSA) scintigraphy.Materials and methods:We measured liver function parameters, including ICGR15, in 307 patients, including 265 liver cancer patients without biliary obstruction (no obstruction group) and 42 with biliary obstruction (obstruction group).Results:In the no obstruction group, multiple regression analysis identified blood pool clearance ratio (HH15), liver uptake ratio (LHL15) calculated by heart and liver activity between 3 and 15 min after injection of (99m)Tc-GSA, and serum hyaluronic acid as significant correlates (P Conclusion:The converted ICGR15 is useful for evaluating hepatic function in patients with biliary obstruction who plan to undergo major hepatectomy.
