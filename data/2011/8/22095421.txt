Purpose:The authors sought to assess the incidence of new foci of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Materials and methods:Two readers retrospectively reviewed by consensus the follow-up MDCT studies of 125 patients (88 men and 37 women; mean age 68 years) with 141 HCCs (size 1-5.2 cm; mean 2.2 cm) treated with RFA. MDCT follow-up was performed at 1 and 3 months and every 6-12 months thereafter. Reviewers assessed: (1) the presence of new HCC foci in the same liver segment or in a different segment; (2) complete or incomplete tumour ablation; (3) tumour progression.Results:A total of 113 new HCCs (size 0.7-4.8 cm; mean 1.7 cm) were detected in 69/125 (55.2%) patients (mean follow-up 30.38Â±19.14 months). Of these, 86 (76.1%) new HCCs were multiple (pConclusions:In patients with RFA-treated HCCs, MDCT follow-up revealed a high incidence of new HCCs, even after 1 year of follow-up. The new foci tended to be multiple and located in a liver segment different from that of the previously treated nodules.
