Background:Since the advent of the human genome, the era of personalized genomic medicine is indisputably in progress.Methods:In an effort to contribute to the evolving knowledge of genomic medicine, we have aimed directly at building a bioresource bank for hepatocellular carcinoma. This tumor bank is based on the rigorous guidelines set forth by the National Cancer Institute, and it offers analytes to help elucidate the mechanisms of progression from cirrhosis to malignancy, risk factors for recurrence, and applicability of current treatment options to a diverse group of people.Conclusions:Surgeons have a privileged position between patients (and their cancer) and the benches of basic science. Thus, we offer a primer based on our own experiences, from which surgeons may take elements to build their own bioresource bank for use in collaboration with others. We highlight some practicalities and pitfalls that could be overlooked, as well as a discussion of possible solutions.
