Background:Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is seldom available because of the lack of reliable markers. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 14 is a cell surface proteinase that displays a broad spectrum of activity against extracellular matrix components and promotes the invasion/metastasis of cells. MMP14 is overexpressed in HCC, and the level is correlated with poor overall survival. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the MMP14 gene polymorphisms are associated with the susceptibility and clinicopathological development of HCC.Methods:A total of 135 patients with HCC and 496 healthy control subjects were recruited. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MMP14 genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) genotyping and haplotype-base analysis.Results:A significant (p Conclusions:The +6767 and +7096 polymorphic genotypes and haplotype -165 T: +221 T: +6727 C: +6767 G: +7096 T: +8153 G of MMP14 gene might contribute to the prediction of susceptibility and pathological development to HCC.
