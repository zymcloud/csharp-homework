Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common primary hepatic tumour originating from biliary tract epithelial cells with poor prognosis. Enhanced c-Myc protein expression contributes to many aspects of tumour cell biology. Although the ability of c-Myc to drive unrestricted cell proliferation and to inhibit cell differentiation had been well recognized, whether down-regulated c-Myc expression can inhibit tumour cell invasion still remains to be explored. The c-Myc ASODN (antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide) and NSODN (nonsense oligodeoxyribonucleotide) were designed, synthesized and transfected into human QBC939 bile duct carcinoma cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The protein expression of c-Myc was detected by Western blot. A transwell experiment was applied to evaluate the invasive capacity of the QBC939 cells. c-Myc ASODN could significantly suppress the c-Myc protein expression (P<0.05) and the invasion (P<0.01) of QBC939 cells transfected with c-Myc ASODN compared with that in the control and c-Myc NSODN-transfected group. Thus in the present study we show that down-regulation of c-Myc expression can inhibit the invasion of QBC939 cells in vitro.
