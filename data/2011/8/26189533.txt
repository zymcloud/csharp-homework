A 52-year-old man suffering from monocular blindness, with light perception only, was admitted to our hospital. The symptom had begun as low vision and developed rapidly within 3 weeks into monocular blindness in the right eye, with no other systemic manifestations. Imaging examinations revealed multiple hepatocellular carcinomas in the cirrhotic liver, and tumors at the skull base and vertebra. A pathological and immunochemical study of specimens obtained by endoscopic transnasal tumor biopsy and laminectomy revealed them to be metastatic hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Although the patient underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy, he died 5 months after admission to our hospital. The cranial HCC, involving only the optic canal, may have disturbed the optic nerve in preference to the other cranial nerves. This is the first report of a HCC patient with monocular blindness as the initial presentation of the disease.
