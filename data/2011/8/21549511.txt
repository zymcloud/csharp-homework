Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism that results in elevated iron absorption in the intestines, which leads to progressive iron accumulation in a variety of organs. Studies have shown that excessive iron deposits in the liver due to hereditary hemochromatosis leads to cirrhosis, which can put an individual at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Testicular atrophy, sometimes caused by excessive iron deposition in the testes, is a risk factor for testicular cancer. Therefore, the possible role of hereditary hemochromatosis in testicular cancer is explored.
