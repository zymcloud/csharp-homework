We report on two patients with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with multiple hepatic nodules. Dynamic computed tomography revealed multiple nodular lesions, which were enhanced at the early contrast phase and washed out at the portal phase. In the hepatobiliary phase using gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI), these tumors did not show any uptake, thus suggesting the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma. An ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed a slight increase in cell density, sinusoidal dilatation, and contained unpaired small arteries. According to immunohistochemical analyses, these arteries were positive for CD34 and alpha-smooth muscle actin. From these findings, the nodules were diagnosed to be focal nodular hyperplastic (FNH)-like nodules arising in alcoholic-cirrhosed livers. The differential diagnosis of FNH-like nodules arising in alcoholic liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is difficult with Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI, and therefore histological confirmation is necessary.
