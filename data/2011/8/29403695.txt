Glypican-3 (GPC3) is reported as a great promising tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis. Highly sensitive and accurate analysis of serum GPC3 (sGPC3), in combination with or instead of traditional HCC marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), is essential for early diagnosis of HCC. Biomaterial-functionalized magnetic particles have been utilized as solid supports with good biological compatibility for sensitive immunoassay. Here, the magnetic nanoparticles (MnPs) and magnetic microparticles (MmPs) with carboxyl groups were further modified with streptavidin, and applied for the development of chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). After comparing between MnPs- and MmPs-based CLEIA, MnPs-based CLEIA was proved to be a better method with less assay time, greater sensitivity, better linearity and longer chemiluminescence platform. MnPs-based CLEIA was applied for detection of sGPC3 in normal liver, hepatocirrhosis, secondary liver cancer and HCC serum samples. The results indicated that sGPC3 was effective in diagnosis of HCC with high performance.
