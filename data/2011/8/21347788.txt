Background:Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) plays an important role in the therapeutic treatment and progression of cancer. However, little is known about the effect of GRP78 expression to curcumin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:In this study, we generated GRP78 knockdown cells (GRP78KD) by a short interfering RNA (siRNA) technique. The antiproliferation effects of curcumin were determined by MTT assay, TUNEL assay, and cell cycle determination.Results:We found that GRP78KD cells were more resistant to curcumin treatment compared with the parental cells in MTT assay. The apoptosis cell population was increased in scrambled-siRNA cells treated with curcumin compared with GRP78KD cells in cell cycle distribution and TUNEL assays. Finally, we found that knocking down GRP78 causes resistance to curcumin treatment through the suppression of caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression levels.Conclusions:We conclude that the expression level of GRP78 may contribute to the therapeutic effect of curcumin on HCC cells.
