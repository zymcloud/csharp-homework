Background:The relationship of Line-1 demethylation and the CD133 expression of cancer stem cells were discussed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:In 95 HCC and matched nontumor tissues, we analyzed the methylation level of Line-1 by quantitative real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, and the expression of CD133 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.Results:Unmethylation of Line-1 increased from nontumor tissues (1.23 × 10(7) copies/μg DNA) toward HCC tissues (2.99 × 10(7) copies/μg DNA), but methylation of Line-1 kept 2 × 10(8) copies/μg DNA around in HCC and nontumor tissues. The methylation index (MI) of Line-1 decreased from 0.919 in nontumor samples to 0.755 in HCC. Results showed that cumulative survival was significantly shorter in HCC patients with MI Conclusions:Line-1 hypomethylation is the most common molecular abnormality during the carcinogenic process. Elevated expression of CD133 was associated with demethylation of Line-1 in HCC.
