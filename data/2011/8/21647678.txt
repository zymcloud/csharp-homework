Purpose:To investigate the expression of claudin 10 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the impact on angiogenesis and the postoperative survival of HCC patients.Methods:The expression of claudin 10 protein was analyzed on samples from 99 HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy with immunohistochemistry and 31 fresh specimens with Western blotting. We examined the relationship between claudin 10 expression with clinicopathological factors, microvessel density (MVD), and postoperative survival.Results:Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining showed that claudin 10 protein was highly expressed in HCC, compared with paraneoplastic liver tissue and normal liver tissue (P Conclusions:Claudin 10 protein is highly expressed in HCC tissue and is closely related to angiogenesis. Claudin 10 protein could be a useful marker to predict poor prognosis of HCC patients after hepatectomy.
