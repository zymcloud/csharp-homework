Purpose:To report our results of nephron-sparing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of renal tumors.Materials and methods:Since August 2004, 49 patients with renal tumors were treated with either percutaneous or laparoscopic RFA. All patients underwent preoperative imaging with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were suspected to have renal cell carcinoma. The follow-up for each patient included a physical examination, chest radiography, liver function tests, and a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. To confirm the pathologic criteria of complete ablation, 30 patients underwent 6-month or 1-year follow-up biopsy. Recurrence was defined as growth of the tumor or any new enhancing portions at 3 months after confirmed nonenhancement of the initial RFA lesion.Results:Technical success was achieved in 46/49 cases (94%). The mean tumor size was 2.4 cm and the mean follow-up period was 31.7 months (range, 6-68 months). Of 49 patients, repeated RFA was necessary in 7 patients (14%). Three patients were found to have recurrence at various follow-up intervals. Twenty-three patients (47%) experienced complications, and all but one necessitated intervention. No distant metastasis was found in any cases, and all patients are alive and are being serially followed up.Conclusions:Percutaneous or laparoscopic RFA is considered to be a useful treatment for selected patients with small renal masses and for nephron-sparing. With a mean follow-up of 31.7 months, our intermediate data suggest excellent therapeutic outcome with RFA with effective local tumor control and preservation of renal function. The ultimate role of this modality will continue to evolve and warrants further studies.
