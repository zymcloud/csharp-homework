Although chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the most important risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide, the proportion of HCC patients negative for the hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody, so-called "non-B non-C HCC", is rapidly increasing, especially in Japan. The background liver diseases of non-B non-C HCC patients can be multifactorial, including occult HBV infection and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. It is reasonable to investigate the non-cancerous liver tissues to identify the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for the processes of hepatocarcinogenesis of non-B non-C HCC. However, to date, only a few studies have focused on this research concept based on the idea of "field cancerization". This review highlights the potential importance of the molecular analysis of non-cancerous liver tissues to clarify the molecular characteristics in patients with non-B non-C HCC. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the individual predisposition to non-B non-C HCC will lead to improvements in the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of this neoplastic disease.
