Background:This series compares outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) listed for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) within and outside Milan criteria, and determines the impact of extended criteria liver allografts (ECD).Methods:Records of patients listed for liver transplantation at a single center from 1998 to 2007 were reviewed retrospectively.Results:Ninety-seven HCC patients were listed for OLT, 77 underwent transplantation; 47 received ECDs and 30 standard organs. ECDs were more frequently allocated to outside Milan recipients. Wait time for OLT was shorter for outside Milan patients (4 vs. 7 months P=0.04) but hazard rate of dropout was higher (26%, 46%, and 73% at 6,12, and 24 months compared with 2%, 14%, and 60% PConclusion:The use of ECD organs provided patients with HCCs outside Milan criteria access to liver transplant at a rate comparable to patients within Milan and model for end-stage liver disease HCC priority. Similar patient survival post-OLT can be achieved using standard or ECD organs. The higher risk of drop out in patients outside Milan, and even within Milan, with tumors more than 3 cm justifies the use of ECD organs for timely transplantation.
