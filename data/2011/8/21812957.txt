Introduction:Conversion of multiple hepatic arteries into a single vascular supply is a very important technique for repeat hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy using an implanted port catheter system. Catheterization of a replaced left hepatic artery arising from a left gastric artery using a percutaneous catheter technique is sometimes difficult, despite the recent development of advanced interventional techniques.Case presentation:We present a case of a 70-year-old Japanese man with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas in whom the replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery needed to be embolized. After several failed procedures, the replaced left hepatic artery was successfully catheterized and embolized with a microcatheter and microcoils via the right gastric artery through the anastomosis.Conclusion:A replaced left hepatic artery arising from a left gastric artery can be catheterized via a right gastric artery by using the appropriate microcatheter and microguidewires, and multiple hepatic arteries can be converted into a single supply.
