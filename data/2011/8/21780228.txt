Purpose:First, to evaluate hepatocyte phospholipid metabolism and energetics during liver regeneration stimulated by portal vein embolization (PVE) using proton-decoupled (31)P MR spectroscopic imaging ((31)P-MRSI). Second, to compare the biophysiologic differences between hepatic regeneration stimulated by PVE and by partial hepatectomy (PH).Materials and methods:Subjects included six patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer who were scheduled to undergo right PVE before definitive resection of right-sided tumor. (31)P-MRSI was performed on the left liver lobe before PVE and 48 h following PVE. Normalized quantities of phosphorus-containing hepatic metabolites were analyzed from both visits. In addition, MRSI data at 48 h following partial hepatectomy were compared with the data from the PVE patients.Results:At 48 h after PVE, the ratio of phosphomonoesters to phosphodiesters in the nonembolized lobe was significantly elevated. No significant changes were found in nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) and Pi values. The phosphomonoester (PME) to phosphodiester (PDE) ratio in regenerating liver 48 h after partial hepatectomy was significantly greater than PME/PDE 48 h after PVE.Conclusion:(31)P-MRSI is a valid technique to noninvasively evaluate cell membrane metabolism following PVE. The different degree of biochemical change between partial hepatectomy and PVE indicates that hepatic growth following these two procedures does not follow the same course.
