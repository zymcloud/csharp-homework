Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health burden, with an estimated 170 million chronically infected individuals worldwide, and a leading cause of liver transplantation. Patients are at increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and even liver failure. In the past two decades, several approaches have been adopted to inhibit non-structural viral proteins. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) of HCV is one of the attractive validated targets for development of new drugs to block HCV infection. In this review, we report the recent progress made towards identifying and developing benzothiadiazines as HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitors. The substituted benzothiadiazine class was identified by HTS in 2002 as an NS5B inhibitor. Further optimization and modification of the core has improved the potency and pharmacokinetic properties of substituted benzothiadiazines. Research on palm site-binding benzothiadiazine analogs and related derivatives and analogs is discussed in this article.
