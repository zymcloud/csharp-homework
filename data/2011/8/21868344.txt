Objective:To analyze the expression of deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) and phosphorelated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK) in breast cancer tissue to further understand the molecular mechanisms of the carcinogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer.Methods:Immunohistochemistry was employed to determine the protein level of DLC1 and p-FAK in 61 breast cancer, 30 benign breast disease and the adjacent normal breast tissues.Results:The positivity rates of DLC1 differed significantly between breast cancer, benign and normal tissues (34.43%, 80.00% and 76.67%, respectively, P<0.001). The positivity rates of p-FAK in the 3 tissues were 77.05%, 33.33% and 26.67%, also showing significant differences (P<0.001). The aberrant expression of DLC1 showed an inverse correlation to p-FAK (Îº=-0.4591). Both DLC1 and p-FAK were closely correlated to the carcinogenesis, clinical stage, PR and lymphatic metastasis of breast cancer (P<0.05), but not to the patients age, pathological subtype, familial history, ER or CerbB-2 (P>0.05).Conclusion:The abnormal expression of DLC1 and p-FAK might participate in the carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis of breast cancer. The role of DLC1 and p-FAK might be related to the regulation of progestone. DLC1 and p-FAK may serve as candidate markers for early diagnosis, prognostic evaluation and target treatment of breast cancer.
