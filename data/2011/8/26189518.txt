Since the majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arises from a background of chronic liver diseases caused by infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), chemoprevention targeting patients at high risk of HCC is feasible. In this review article, we summarize current knowledge of chemoprevention against HCC mostly using phytochemicals which have less toxicity than pharmaceutical agents. We describe in vivo and in vitro evidence and proposed mechanisms of beneficial effects of several compounds on the liver, including acyclic retinoid (ACR), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), caffeine, capsaicin, cepharanthine (CEP), cinnamaldehyde, curcumin, diallyl sulfide (DAS), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), genistein, lycopene, resveratrol, silymarin, sulforaphane (SFN), and xanthohumol (XN). Because antihepatocarcinogenic effects by these compounds are mostly based on experimental studies, clinical evidence is urgently necessary.
