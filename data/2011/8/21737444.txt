Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) expression is frequently suppressed in liver cancers and can be reactivated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. This study examined the role of IGFBP-3 in mediating the effects of the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 in liver cancer cells and identified IGFBP-3-dependent proteins that regulate proliferation and migration. In HepG2 cells, MS-275 inhibited DNA synthesis, cell cycle activity, and cell viability concomitantly with increased binding of acetylated histone H3 to IGFBP-3 promoter sequences and induction of IGFBP-3 expression. IGFBP-3 down-regulation by siRNA significantly reversed the inhibition of cell viability and DNA synthesis by MS-275, indicating an intermediary role for IGFBP-3. Induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 by MS-275 was attenuated by IGFBP-3 down-regulation, providing an explanation for IGFBP-3-dependent effects of MS-275 on cell cycle activity. In contrast, MS-275 stimulated HepG2 cell migration, an effect also inhibited by IGFBP-3 down-regulation. Among genes whose induction by MS-275 was attenuated by IGFBP-3 down-regulation, LYVE1 and THBS2 (thrombospondin-2) were identified as mediators of IGFBP-3-dependent effects of MS-275. Silencing of either protein had no effect on the inhibition of HepG2 viability by MS-275 but reversed its stimulatory effect on cell migration. We conclude that among genes up-regulated by MS-275, IGFBP-3 is a key mediator of effects on hepatoma cell growth and migration, involving IGFBP-3-dependent proteins p21 (proliferation) and LYVE1 and THBS2 (migration). The enhanced cell motility that accompanies reactivation of IGFBP-3 expression in liver cancer by HDAC inhibition suggests the possibility of increased metastatic spread despite inhibited cell proliferation.
