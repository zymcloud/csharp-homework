Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Currently, pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin therapy achieve curative responses in 40% to 80% of patients, depending on genotype. Recognition of new therapeutic targets for HCV therapy has led to development of novel therapies. The purpose of this review is to summarize the status of novel therapeutics for CHC that promise to increase the safety and efficacy of therapy.
