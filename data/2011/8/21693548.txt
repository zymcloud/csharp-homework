Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV encodes an oncogenic hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), which is a multifunctional regulator that modulates signal transduction, transcription, cell cycle progress, protein degradation, apoptosis, and genetic stability through direct and indirect interaction with host factors. The subcellular localization of HBx is primarily cytoplasmic, with a small fraction in the nucleus. In addition, high levels of HBx expression lead to an abnormal mitochondrial distribution. The dynamic distribution of HBx could be important to the multiple functions of HBx at different stages of the HBV life cycle. This short review presents an overview of the differential roles of HBx as a function of its intracellular localization.
