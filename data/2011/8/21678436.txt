Several viral factors are associated with disease progression in hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. Compared with Taiwanese Han Chinese, Taiwanese aborigines have a higher prevalence of chronic HBV infection and a higher standardized mortality rate of chronic liver diseases but a lower standardized mortality rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate whether aboriginal Taiwanese HBV carriers have more favorable viral factors which reduce the risk for HCC than Han Chinese carriers. Blood samples from 3,488 HBV carriers (1,527 aborigines and 1,961 Han Chinese) were assayed for aminotransferases, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), HBV DNA, and HBV genotype. Aboriginal HBV carriers had a lower HBeAg-positive rate (5.3% vs. 10.2%, P 2,000 IU/ml (27.4% vs. 36.7%, P
