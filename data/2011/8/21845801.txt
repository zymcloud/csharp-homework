Objectives:The effect of Podophyllum hexandrum methanolic extract and alpha-tocopherol in reducing oxidative stress in male albino rats was evaluated.Materials and methods:Lipid peroxidation was monitored by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) level in different tissues of rats. Activities of free radical scavenging enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase) were determined using H2O2 decomposition.Results:Results showed that administration of H2O2 (0.1%) in drinking water of the rats, for 25 weeks, increased the malondialdehyde levels in liver, kidney and lung tissues of all the rats. However, rats receiving Podophyllum hexandrum extract and alpha-tocopherol had lower MDA levels in a dose dependent manner, which indicates decreased lipid peroxidation in these rats. Increase in the catalase activity appears to be a response to H2O2 accumulation. The decrease in the activity of catalase and increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in different organs of the rats receiving Podophyllum hexandrum extract and alpha-tocopherol indicates the protective effect of the plant in combating oxidative stress undergone by the rats.Objectives:Rhizome of Podophyllum hexandrum have been ethnomedically claimed to possess a wide array of biological activities including anticancer activity.Materials and methods:To verify the folklore claim, this study was performed in a six Human carcinoma cell lines, Lung (A-549), Prostate (PC-3), Colon (Colo-25), Breast (MCF-7), Neuroblastoma (IMR-32) and CNS (SF-295) MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.Results:Methanol and 70% ethanolic extracts of the rhizome of Podophyllum hexandrum showed highest cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 (Breast) and Colo-25 (Colon) cell line, as determined with sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay.Conclusions:These findings 1 - showed that Podophyllum hexandrum extract may ameliorate H2O2 induced oxidative stress by decreasing lipid peroxidation via alteration of the antioxidant defense system of the rats. 2 - these data also showed the anticancer activity of the plant extracts on different human cancer cell lines. However, further investigation is needed to assess the molecular mechanisms mediated anticancer activities of this plant.
