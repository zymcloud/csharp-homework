Objective:To provide an overview of recent studies on transarterial chemoembolization-related hepatic and biliary damage (TRHBD) in patients with malignant hepatic tumors (MHT) and to explore the reasons for TRHBD.Methods:Literature on the treatments for MHT by TACE was sought in PubMed and the related information was summarized.Results:TRHBD is found to occur in the hepatic parenchymal cells, biliary tree and blood-vascular system. The damage is mainly due to ischemia resulting from embolic materials such as gelatin sponge and lipiodol. In addition, clinicians' skill levels in non-superselective catheterization, the health condition of the patients, and the chemical agents used may also be related to the damage. Most of the deterioration can be reversed if the patients are diagnosed and treated properly and promptly.Conclusions:Understanding the mechanisms of TRHBD more comprehensively is helpful in developing effective methods for prevention and treatment.
