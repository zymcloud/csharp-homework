Background/aims:The clinical effects of clevudine have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infections (CHIs). In this investigation, we assessed whether clevudine induced biochemical and virological improvements in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with CHI.Methods:Fifty-four patients who received 30 mg clevudine for more than 24 weeks between 2007 and 2009 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Korea, were enrolled. Among these cases, 39 had HCC (CHI/HCC group) and 15 did not (CHI group).Results:In relation to the CHI group, the CHI/HCC group was older (55.5 years.) and had a higher liver cirrhosis rate (79.5%) (p0.05). Liver function was preserved with clevudine treatment in patients displaying response or stable disease under anti-cancer therapy. Four patients (7.4%) developed viral resistance during clevudine therapy. Among these, one was na√Øve, and three had previously received antiviral therapy. One CHI/HCC patient (1.9%) discontinued clevudine treatment due to symptomatic myopathy.Conclusions:Our findings clearly indicate that clevudine has comparable antiviral and biochemical effects in patients with CHI and with CHI/HCC and preserves the underlying liver function in HBV-related HCC patients.
