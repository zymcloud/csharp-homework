Objectives:The goal of our study was to describe the chemoembolization technique of transarterial catheterization using microspheres loaded with doxorubicin and to evaluate its tolerance and short-term efficacy on a small number of patients.Materials and methods:Our retrospective study was conducted over 8 months (December 2007-July 2008). It was done at the Brest University Medical Centre (France), in the radiology and hepato-gastroenterology departments of the HÃ´pital de la Cavale Blanche. We performed a transarterial chemoembolization using microspheres loaded with doxorubicin to 9 patients who had hepatocellular carcinoma in relation to alcoholic cirrhosis.Results:Eight of 9 patients have benefited from a complete procedure (88.9% technical success) and in 100% of these cases, there were no clinical complications or biologic modifications immediately after embolization. After 4 weeks, there were seven cases of regression of more than 30% of the size of the tumor nodules, six cases of total tumor necrosis, and two cases of contrast uptake inside the nodules (partial tumor necrosis). In three cases (37.5%), there was an emergence of new tumor nodules.Conclusion:Chemoembolization accomplished by transarterial catheterization using microspheres loaded with doxoribicin is a probable technique for the future of palliative treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas. The technique is simple to perform and seems to be well tolerated by patients in terms of clinical and biological aspects.
