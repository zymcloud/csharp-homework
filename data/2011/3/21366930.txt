Background:As the expression of human sperm protein 17 (Sp17) in normal tissue is limited and the function is obscure, its aberrant expression in malignant tumors makes it to be a candidated molecular marker for tumor imaging diagnosis and targeting therapy of the diseases.The aim of this research is to evaluate the targeting effects of anti-sperm protein 17 monoclonal antibody (anti-Sp17) on cancer in vivo and investigate its usefulness as a reagent for molecular imaging diagnosis.Methods:Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the expression of Sp17 in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and tumor xenograft specimens. A near infrared fluorescence dye, ICG-Der-02, was covalently linked to anti-Sp17 for in vivo imaging. The immuno-activity of the anti-Sp17-ICG-Der-02 complex was tested in vitro by ELISA; it was then injected into tumor-bearing nude mice through the caudal vein to evaluate its tumor targeting effect by near infrared imaging system.Results:Overexpression of Sp17 on the surface of the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721 was demonstrated. Anti-Sp17-ICG-Der-02 with immuno-activity was successfully synthesized. The immuno-activity and photo stability of anti-Sp17- ICG-Der-02 showed good targeting capability for Sp17 expressing tumor models (SMMC-7721) in vivo, and its accumulation in the tumor lasted for at least 7 days.Conclusions:Anti-Sp17 antibody targeted and accumulated in Sp17 positive tumors in vivo, which demonstrated its capability of serving as a diagnostic reagent.
