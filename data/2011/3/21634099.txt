We present rare case of clear cell renal carcinoma metastasis into common bile duct. It is a 9th case listed on the MEDLINE data base from 1966 to 2010.71-year-old woman underwent right nefrectomy for renal cancer G1 in 1986. She was reoperated in 2006 for relaps in renal bed on the right side. Histological examination confirmed clear cell renal carcinoma again. At present, a new liver metastasis in S 4/5 was detected. During the operation we found first described liver metastasis and second another one in common bile duct with intraluminal growth. Before surgery the patient showed neither clinical nor laboratory marks of biliary obstruction. Even abdominal ultrasound, SONO VUE, CT and body PET were negative. We carried out choledochectomy with hepaticojejunoanastomosis sec Roux and liver metastasis was destructed using radiofrequency ablation.
