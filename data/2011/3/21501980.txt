Introduction:Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with liver inflammation and carcinogenesis. The prevalence of T2DM among patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is increasing. However, the effect of T2DM on the natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma is not known.Aim:To examine the effect of T2DM on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) survival in treated and untreated disease.Methods:Retrospective analysis was performed on HCC cases diagnosed during 2000-2005, and prospectively during 2006-August 2007. Demographics, HCC staging, response to treatment, and survival were collected. A comparison was made between patients with T2DM and without T2DM.Results:One hundred and thirty-five patients were recruited in total; 58 (43%) had T2DM. Seventy (37 diabetic) patients were treated with percutaneous radiological therapies, with 168 treatments given. Treatment was determined by AASLD guidelines and patient tolerance, there was no randomisation. There was no significant difference in survival between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. There was a nonsignificant trend towards greater survival in diabetic patients (overall median survival diabetics 21 mths vs nondiabetics 5 mths, P=0.355).Conclusions:T2DM does not negatively impact on the natural history of treated or untreated HCC.
