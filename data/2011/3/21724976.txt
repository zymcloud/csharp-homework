Small fish models have been used for decades in carcinogenicity testing. Demonstration of common morphological changes associated with specific mechanisms is a clear avenue by which data can be compared across divergent phyletic levels. Dimethylnitrosamine, used in rats to model human alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatic neoplasia, is also a potent hepatotoxin and carcinogen in fish. We recently reported some striking differences in the mutagenicity of DMN in lambda cII transgenic medaka fish vs. Big Blue(®) rats, but the pre-neoplastic and neoplastic commonalities between the two models are largely unknown. Here, we focus on these commonalities, with special emphasis on the TGF-β pathway and its corresponding role in DMN-induced hepatic neoplasia. Similar to mammals, hepatocellular necrosis, regeneration, and dysplasia; hepatic stellate cell and "spindle cell" proliferation; hepatocellular and biliary carcinomas; and TGF-β1 expression by dysplastic hepatocytes all occurred in DMN-exposed medaka. Positive TGF-β1 staining increased with increasing DMN exposure in bile preductular epithelial cells, intermediate cells, immature hepatocytes and fewer mature hepatocytes. Muscle specific actin identified hepatic stellate cells in DMN-exposed fish. Additional mechanistic comparisons between animal models at different phyletic levels will continue to facilitate the interspecies extrapolations that are so critical to toxicological risk assessments.
