Objective:To determine the ability of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP-L3% serum level in discriminating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from other types of liver mass.Material and method:This study was performed according to a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) design. A total of 109 HCC patients and 51 patients with other types of liver mass were consecutively selected. The levels of AFP and AFP-L3% in their sera were measured.Results:AFP levels in serum significantly elevated while AFP-L3% levels significantly decreased in HCC patients (AFP: p Conclusion:The diagnostic accuracy of serum AFP and AFP-L3% could provide them as candidate biomarkers to discriminate patients with HCC from patients with other types of liver mass. Serum AFP-L3% as a prognostic factor for HCC should be further evaluated in more details.
