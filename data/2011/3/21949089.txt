In this article, the cytotoxicity of the venom from the nematocysts of jellyfish Cyanea nozakii Kishinouye on human hepatoma cells (Bel-7402, SMMC-7721) and human colon cancer cells (H630) was investigated first. Of the three kinds of cells, the venom had the strongest cytotoxicity on H630 cells with the 50% lethal concentration (IC(50)) of 5.1 μg/ml. However, the IC(50) on Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 was approximate 17.9 and 24.3 μg/ml, respectively. The cytotoxicity of the venom was affected by pH, temperature and storage conditions. At the pH 4.5-8.5, the venom displayed obvious cytotoxicity and the percentage of survival was about 50%. When pre-incubated at temperatures over 60°C for as short as 10 min, the percentage of survival sharply improved from 4.6% up to 80%. The venom was stored in a more stable condition at -80°C and in lyophilized state compared to other storage conditions used in this study. Lactate dehydrogenase release assay performed on H630 cells indicated that exposure to the venom could result in damage to the cell membrane.
