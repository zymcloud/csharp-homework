Background/purpose:It has been reported recently that adjuvant gemcitabine prolonged postoperative disease-free survival in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. However, the efficacy was limited and further studies are required to improve the prognosis. In particular, postoperative hepatic recurrence often occurs even after gemcitabine treatment.Methods:We are currently trying to evaluate the efficacy of postoperative combination therapy of high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) arterial infusion with systemic gemcitabine. Patients received weekly high-dose 5-FU through the hepatic artery using a port-catheter system (1000 mg/m(2) for 5 h) plus concurrent systemic gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)).Results:Thirty-one patients were enrolled and 29 patients (94%) completed the scheduled adjuvant chemotherapy. The toxicity was acceptable and this regimen was well feasible as an outpatient treatment. At the time of analysis, 21 patients (68%) had recurrence. Local recurrence was most frequently observed, in 43% of the patients with recurrence. On the other hand, hepatic recurrence developed in only 2 patients (10%). The 1-year disease-free rate and overall survival rate were 62.9 and 100%, respectively.Conclusion:Our novel adjuvant strategy had a significant beneficial effect on early hepatic recurrence and may have the potential to prolong the overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients.
