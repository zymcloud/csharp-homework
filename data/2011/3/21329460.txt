Recently, a link between high levels of circulating IL-6 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been proposed. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene have been reported to be related to several inflammatory-related conditions, including cancer. The purpose of this article is: (1) to evaluate the frequencies of SNPs in the IL-6 promoter region at position -174 and IL-6 serum levels in a group of patients with HCC and underlying liver cirrhosis (LC), and compare them with a group of LC patients without HCC; (2) to determine whether a possible correlation exists between the allelic variations, IL-6 serum levels, and the risk of developing HCC. The study included 105 HCC and 95 LC patients. Genomic DNA was isolated using commercially available kits. DNA samples were typed for relevant SNPs of the IL-6 promoter region (-174 G>C, G allele being associated with higher levels of the cytokine). The Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP-PCR) method was used to type the SNPs. IL-6 serum levels were determined using an ultrasensitive commercially available ELISA kit. IL-6 serum levels were higher in G/G compared to C/C genotypes only in HCC (z=2; p=0.04) and G/G versus G/C (z=1.8; p
