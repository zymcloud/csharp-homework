Objective:To construct glypican-3 (GPC3)-green fluorescent protein eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-c3-GPC3, and analyze the effect of GPC3 on the proliferation of human hepatoma cell line MHCC-97L.Methods:The eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-c3-GPC3 was constructed with recombinant DNA technique and transfected into MHCC-97L cells via Lipofectamine 2000. The cells stably expressing GPC3 were screened by flow cytometry and G418. The mRNA expression of GPC3 was detected by RT-QPCR method, and the protein expression by Western blotting and fluorescence microscope. The effect of GPC3 gene on the growth of the cells was examined by MTT assay.Results:Restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA sequencing verified correct construction of the recombinant plasmid. The green fluorescence was detected in the transfected MHCC-97L cells under fluorescence microscope. RT-QPCR and Western blotting both confirmed successful expression of GPC3 in MHCC-97L cells. The growth curve showed a significant acceleration of the proliferation of the transfected MHCC97-Lsol;GPC3 cells as compared with MHCC97-L and MHCC97-L/C3 cells (PConclusion:We have successfully constructed the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFR-c3-GPC3, which allows stable GPC3 expression in MHCC97-L/GPC3 cells. The upregulation of GPC3 expression can stimulate the growth of hepatoma cell line MHCC97-L in vitro.
