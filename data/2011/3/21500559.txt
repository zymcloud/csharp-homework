Objective:To study the effects of verapamil (VR) on proliferation, DNA synthesis and migration of human hepatoma cell line HepG2.Methods:HepG2 cells were treated with different concentration of VR (0,1, 5, 10, 15, 20 microg/mL) for different time point. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay and DNA synthesis was determined by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (Edu) fluorescent assay. The migration of cells was measured by Scratch wound migration assay.Results:MTT assay demonstrated that the different concentration of VR (1, 5, 10, 15, 20 microg/mL) could inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells after 24 h and 48 h treatment (P < 0.05) except 1, 5 microg/mL group processing for 24 h (P > 0.05). Edu fluorescent assay showed that, the proportion of HepG2 cells in the stage of DNA synthesis was (51.5 +/- 3.78)%, (52.4 +/- 3.26)%, (53.1 +/- 1.94)%, (39.6 +/- 4.25)%, (40.2 +/- 2.67)%, (42.6 +/- 3.13)% respectively for the treatment of 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 microg/mL concentration of VR for 24 h. DNA synthesis in the cells treated with VR (10, 15 and 20 microg/mL concentration) was lower than that in the cells treated with 0, 1, 5 microg/mL concentrations of VR (P < 0.05). Scratch wound migration assay indicated that treatment with VR (10, 15 and 20 microg/mL) for 24 h significantly inhibited cells migration distance (P < 0.05).Conclusion:Calcium channel blocker VR could inhibit the cell proliferation and migration of human hepatoma cell line HepG2.
