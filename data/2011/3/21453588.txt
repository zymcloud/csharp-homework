Introduction:Bleeding esophageal varices is the most serious complication of the portal hypertension, and the greater cause of dead (25% of the patients). The survival after esophageal varices bleeding depends in wide part from the swiftness and effectiveness of hemostasis and from the degree of functional liver reserve. Aim of our manuscript is to report our experience about hemostasis bleeding esophageal varices with endoscopic rubber band ligation.Patients and methods:From January 1999 to January 2008 we performed 302 esofagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) for esophageal varices bleeding (M: F ratio = 1.4:1, mean age 56.4 years, 62% of cases with HCV-related cirrhosis, 29% alcoholic cirrhosis and 9% cryptogenic cirrhosis; 20% suffered from chronic renal failure, 15% diabetes mellitus, 10% hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis, 5% systemic encephalopathy and 1% AIDS). RESULTS; All patients were treated within 6 hours after the first reported episode of haematemesis and all received beta-blocker therapy after the episode. In the first phase of our experience were used rechargeable elastic ligator and then multibyte, even in combination with polidocanol sclerotherapy (8%) or injection of cyanoacrylate (5%). The best results were achieved with band ligation, in terms of primitive haemostasis, rebleeding, (3%), intraoperative mortality (1%) and 6 weeks mortality (1%).Conclusion:To date, no single method applicable to all patients with bleeding esophageal varices, but endoscopic rubber band ligation is currently considered the first-line treatment of proper multidisciplinary approach to the patient, both during the acute event than prevention of rebleeding, because it is an effective, safe and repeatable, in experienced hands.
