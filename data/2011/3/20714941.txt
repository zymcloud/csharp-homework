Background:No standard therapies have been established for the treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation.Discussion:Sirolimus is a mTOR inhibitor which has been used as an immunosuppressive medication in patients who are at high risk of tumor reoccurrence after liver transplantation. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced HCC. However the role of sorafenib in patients with HCC reoccurrence after liver transplantation is unclear.Results:Combination of sirolimus and sorafenib appears to have synergistic effect when treating HCC in preclinical settings. We report a case of a post-liver transplant patient treated with sorafenib and sirolimus for hepatic HCC recurrence who exhibited complete radiologic response after 5A months of therapy.
