The aim of the study was to investigate the risk of death for 12 months follow-up after registration of tuberculosis (TB), using a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study. A total of 33851 new TB cases were enrolled from 2006 to 2008. Of these, 5584 (16.5%) patients died during the follow-up period because of TB, and 4224 (12.5%) patients died because of other causes. Multivariate survival analysis revealed that age, HIV, chronic kidney disease, stroke, cancer, and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis were significant risk factors associated with death. Patients of age 0 to 64 years with HIV, chronic kidney disease, cancer, stroke, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, or diabetes had a higher risk of death than those without these comorbidities. The majority of the TB patients in Taiwan died because of causes other than TB, and death often occurred in the first 2 months after TB registration. Therefore, medical care and case management for those with comorbidities are advised to prevent death during TB treatment.
