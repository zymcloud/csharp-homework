Background:The present study was designed to explore the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic re-resection of recurrent liver tumors.Methods:Among 120 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who received laparoscopic hepatectomy, six were carefully selected to receive laparoscopic re-resection. Surgical indications were evaluated by specific selection criteria for tumor location, size, metastases, vessel invasion, and liver function. Four patients received laparoscopic partial hepatectomy, and two received laparoscopic anatomical left lateral lobe resection. Results were analyzed retrospectively.Results:The six surgeries (four laparoscopic partial hepatectomies, two laparoscopic anatomical left lateral lobe resections) were successfully performed with no intraoperative complications. Mean operative time was 140.83 ± 35.69 min, mean blood loss was 283.33 ± 256.25 ml, and mean hospital stay was 5.67 ± 1.63 days.Conclusions:Our experience with carefully selected cases meeting specific criteria suggests that laparoscopic hepatic re-resection is a safe, feasible procedure that may offer multiple benefits for treating recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.
