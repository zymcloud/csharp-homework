The patient was a 61-year-old female with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, who was admitted to our hospital due to elevation of AFP.During the evaluation, both abdominal ultrasound and enhanced abdominal CT revealed a hepatocellular carcinoma measuring 4 cm in the S6-7 region, complicated with an arteriovenous shunt.Additionally, the lung CT examination showed 20 isolated bilateral lung tumors, all of which were less than 1.4 cm in diameter. Following the diagnosis, we performed a transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy of SMANCS at 3 mg through the right heptic artery. Thereafter, the AFP level returned to normal. Additionally, the tumors previously observed in both liver and lung, and exhibited by both lung CT and enhanced abdominal MRI, had disappeared.The patient has been in clinical remission more than 10 years to date.
