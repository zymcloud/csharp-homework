Background and objectives:Sprouty (Spry) proteins are important modulators of the RTK/Ras/MAPK pathway, overactivation of which is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus far, the roles of Sprouty in HCC is still unclear.Methods:The expressions of SPRY1, SPRY2, SPRY3, and SPRY4, at the mRNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in paired HCC and non-tumor liver tissues from 31 patients.Results:The expression levels of SPRY1, SPRY2, and SPRY4 in tumor tissues were significantly different from those in non-tumor tissues with the average log fold change values of 0.15, -0.34, and -0.37, respectively; however, that of SPRY3 was not significantly different. SPRY1 expression was also found to be significantly up-regulated in the cases without underlying cirrhosis compared with those with cirrhosis (log fold change of 0.35 and -0.02, respectively, P Conclusion:This study demonstrates that Sprouty genes are differentially expressed in HCC and might provide some insight into their roles in HCC carcinogenesis.
