Liver fibrosis progression in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been in part associated with race/ethnicity. Little is known of the frequency of clinical cirrhosis in Asian patients in the US.Aim:To compare histological and clinical features of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in a multiethnic cohort of patients.Methods:Retrospective query of an electronic medical registry for CHC patients evaluated from 1999 to 2005. Histological cirrhosis was defined as advanced METAVIR fibrosis score at biopsy. Clinical cirrhosis was defined as any of: varices, ascites, or splenomegaly. Liver cirrhosis was defined as either histological or clinical cirrhosis. Chi-square tests, t tests, and logistic regression method were used for data analysis.Results:Six hundred and ninety-two patients were categorized into four racial-ethnic groups: 292 Caucasian (C), 145 Hispanic (H), 121 African American (AA), and 134 Asian (As) patients. Median age of AA (54 years) and As (53) was higher than C (52), or H (50) (p Conclusions:Using only histology, liver cirrhosis was significantly underestimated. In our cohort, severity of CHC was not clearly affected by race when alcohol use and features of the metabolic syndrome were taken into consideration. However, there was a trend for African Americans to have lower cirrhosis rates.
