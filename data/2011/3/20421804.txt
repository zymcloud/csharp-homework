Hepatic cysts are a rare presentation of metastases to the liver and typically have ovarian or neuroendocrine sources. Recently, there has been an increased interest in the identification and treatment of hepatic metastases in patients with malignancies. This is most likely owing to improved imaging and treatment modalities, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, all of which have led to better control of local disease and, possibly, prolonged survival. We describe here the clinical and pathologic features of a patient with a remote history of tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma presenting 5 years later with bilobar hepatic cysts. The hepatic cyst wall proved to be positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
