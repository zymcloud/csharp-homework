Objective:The aim of this paper was to evaluate the application of ARFI ultrasound imaging and its potential value for characterizing focal solid liver lesions.Materials and methods:In this multicentric prospective study, over a total non-consecutive period of four months, all patients underwent ARFI US examination. Two independent operators performed 5 measurements per each lesion and 2 measurements in the surrounding liver. According to the definitive diagnosis, a mean velocity value and standard deviations were obtained in each type of focal solid lesion, compared by using t-test, and the inter-operator evaluation was performed by using the Student's t-test. A comparison between the total mean values of each type of lesion and the mean value of the parenchyma was performed.Results:40 lesions were evaluated and a total of 400 measurements were obtained. The lesions were: 6/40(15%) hepatocellular carcinomas, 7/40(17.5%) hemangiomas, 5/40(12.5%) adenomas, 9/40(22.5%) metastases and 13/40(32.5%) focal nodular hyperplasias. The total mean values obtained were: 2.17 m/s in HCCs, 2.30 m/s in hemangiomas, 1.25 m/s in adenomas, 2.87 m/s in metastases and 2.75 m/s in FNHs. The inter-operator evaluation resulted non-statistically different (p>0.05). A significant difference (pConclusions:ARFI technology with Virtual Touch tissue quantification could non-invasively provide significant complementary information regarding the tissue stiffness, useful for the differential diagnosis of focal solid liver lesions.
