MicroRNA-96 (miR-96) expression is dysregulated in certain types of cancers. However, the role of miR-96 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invasion and metastasis remains elusive. miR-96 expression was investigated in a number of HCC cell lines by quantitative reverse transcriptionâ€‘polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cell invasive ability of metastatic HCCLM6 cells transfected with anti-miR-96 oligonucleotides or miR-96 mimic was determined by Matrigel invasion assay in vitro. In addition, metastasis-associated protein, osteopontin, was evaluated by Western blotting. miR-96 expression was significantly increased in highly metastatic HCCLM6 cells. Decreasing miR-96 expression with anti-miR-96 oligonucleotides led to reduced migration and invasion of HCCLM6 cells in vitro. In particular, down-regulation of miR-96 decreased osteopontin expression in HCCLM6 cells. Suppression of miR-96 expression inhibits the invasion of HCC cells, suggesting that miR-96 may be a therapeutic target for inhibiting HCC invasion and metastasis.
