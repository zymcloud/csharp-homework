Apigenin, a common plant flavonoid, has been shown to possess anti-tumor properties; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not completely understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of apigenin on human hepatoma Huh7 cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and colony formation in vitro, as well as on the tumorigenicity of Huh7 cells in vivo. To get more insight into the mechanism of apigenin action, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of apigenin-treated Huh7 cells using cDNA microarrays (Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray) that contain 41,000 genes. Ten of the most differentially expressed genes (≧5-fold changes) were selected for further evaluation by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) and Western blot analyses. Notably, apigenin (5-20 μg/ml) remarkably inhibited Huh7 cell proliferation and colony formation as compared to the vehicle control, which was in a dose-dependent manner. Accompanying with the decreased growth, apigenin-treated cells showed a cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and an increased rate of apoptosis. Moreover, the xenografts derived from Huh7 cells were significantly (p
