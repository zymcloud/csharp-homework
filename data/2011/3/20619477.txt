Purpose:The aim of this retrospective study is to present data on patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and treatment results in an unselected contemporary patient population with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in limited disease (LD) and extensive disease stage (ED).Patients and methods:From June 2004 to December 2008, our electronic database including all in-patient and out-patient contacts was searched for patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer. 397 patients were found having SCLC. We collected data on patient characteristics, chemotherapy, side effects, response on treatment and survival.Results:39% of all patients had LD SCLC. Median age was 63 years. The response rate (RR) reached 76%. Stable disease was the result of first line therapy in 16%. Consecutive thoracic radiotherapy was given in 72%. Additional prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was administered to 33%. 43% received second line therapy. Median survival was 18.8 months. In 61% of cases, ED SCLC was diagnosed. Median age was 61 years. Main metastatic sites were liver, bone, brain and adrenal glands. RR was 69%. Stable disease and progressive disease were the result of first line chemotherapy both in 12%. 15% received palliative cranial irradiation, 3% PCI. 51% were treated with second line therapy. Median survival reached 10.6 months.Conclusion:We provide a comprehensive analysis of a contemporary patient population. Treatment patterns and survival data fit well in the context of current international trials on more selected patients. Multivariate analyses confirmed extend of disease, performance status and LDH serum levels as independent prognostic factors for survival. Age and gender reached no statistical significance.
