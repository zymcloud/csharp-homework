Introduction:Signet ring cell carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is a rare entity and less than 20 cases have been described in the literature. We report the cases of two patients with this disease and provide a literature review of previous studies.Case report:We describe two patients with obstructive jaundice. Abdominal ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography showed dilatation of the intrahepatic and common bile duct. Duodenoscopy indicated a protruding mass on the ampulla of Vater. Histopathological examination showed round cells and their nuclei were located on one side with prominent signet-ring features. One patient underwent a cephalic pancreatoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy and the other a total pancreatectomy.Discussion:Signet ring cell carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater has only been described in isolated cases in the literature. Therefore, the clinicopathological features and prognosis of this disease have not yet been well defined.
