The safety of chemotherapy during pregnancy is debatable. We present a case of advanced ovarian cancer, diagnosed at week 28 of gestational age, treated with 2 cycles of paclitaxel/cisplatin (TC) chemotherapy during pregnancy, with no serious toxicity. At week 34, the patient underwent a caesarean section and delivered a healthy girl. Four additional cycles of TC were administered. Three months after completing chemotherapy, the patient developed abdominal progression and subsequently a huge metastatic cystic mass in the brain. Despite subsequent therapies, the patient died of progressive disease 35 months after the diagnosis. The infant had normal growth and development by 73 months of her age. This is another reported case of ovarian cancer diagnosed during the second trimester of the pregnancy treated with TC chemotherapy without apparent teratogenic effect.
