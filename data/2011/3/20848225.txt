Background:Overexpressions of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) play important roles in the development and progression of cancers. This study investigates the expression of HDGF combined with VEGF, their correlation with clinicopathologic features, and their prognosis in human hilar cholangiocarcinoma.Materials and methods:The expressions of HDGF and VEGF were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using the streptavidin peroxidase complex method for 58 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma receiving surgery. Their correlation with clinicopathologic features was then investigated. The relationships between them and the survival time of patients were retrospectively analyzed.Results:HDGF and VEGF were positively expressed in 27 (46.6%) and 42 (72.4%) patients, respectively. HDGF and VEGF had a positive correlation (r = 0.370, P = 0.004) in the Spearman rank correlation analysis. HDGF expression was associated with gender and histological type. Patients with positive HDGF expression had a significantly poorer overall survival rate than those with negative HDGF expression (35.7 vs. 73.3%, P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that HDGF expression is an independent prognostic factor.Conclusions:HDGF expression significantly correlates with VEGF expression and is a valuable prognostic factor for human hilar cholangiocarcinoma.
