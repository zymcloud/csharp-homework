Insulinomas constitute about 25% of endocrine pancreatic tumors. Laparoscopic surgery is the treatment of choice. However, pancreas-related complications rate is very high, even in experienced hands, ranging up to 37%. Alternative procedures such as embolization with trisacryl have not been accepted by the surgical community. Image-guided robotic radiosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (CyberKnife) is a minimally invasive procedure delivering large doses of ionizing radiation to a well-defined target. CyberKnife radiosurgery is successfully used in brain cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, liver metastases, kidney cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The authors present the first case to their knowledge of a benign functioning insulinoma successfully treated by a CyberKnife technique with a 3-year follow-up.
