Proteins of viral capsid may self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) that can find many biomedical applications such as platform for drug delivery. In this paper, we describe preparation of VLPs by self-assembly of VP6, a rotavirus capsid protein that was chemically conjugated with doxorubicin (DOX), an anticancer drug. VP6 was first highly expressed in E. Coli, followed by purification and renaturation. DOX was then covalently attached to VP6 to form DOX-VP6 (DVP6) conjugates, which were subsequently self-assembled into VLPs under appropriate condition. Next, lactobionic acid (LA) was chemically linked to the surface of the VLPs. We demonstrated that the aforementioned nanosystem shows specific targeting to hepatoma cell line HepG2. The chemically functionalized VLPs, a kind of biological nanoparticles with excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, can be prepared in large scale from E. Coli through our method, which may find practical applications in biomedicine.
