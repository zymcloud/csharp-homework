Combined hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare entity comprising 1-14.2% of all primary liver carcinomas. In this report, we present a case of rapid progression of cHCC-CC, a rare tumor in a 77-year-old Caucasian male patient with hepatitis B-induced cirrhosis, moderately elevated alpha fetoprotein, and imaging and pathologic features of a mixed liver tumor. There was no evidence of metastatic disease in the chest, abdomen or pelvis by computed tomography (CT) scan at the time of diagnosis. Needle biopsy of the segment 8 lesion revealed two discrete histologic components to the tumor: well-differentiated HCC and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, consistent with intrahepatic CC.The patient rapidly developed metastatic disease after initial local therapy with hepatic arterial chemoembolization and percutaneous cryoablation, dying within 5 months of diagnosis. Radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation and radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres remain possible treatment strategies for patients with cHCC-CC unable to undergo surgical resection. The diagnosis and treatment of cHCC-CC can be challenging due to clinical, imaging and histological features that overlap with pure HCC and CC.
