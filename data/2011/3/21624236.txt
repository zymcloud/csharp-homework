Objective:To investigate the relationship between genetic polymorphism in microRNAs (miRNAs) precursor and genetic predisposition of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese population.Methods:A case-control study including 963 HCC cases and 829 HBsAg positive controls and 852 HBsAg negative controls was conducted. hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 C→G and hsa-mir-196-a2 rs11614913 T→C were selected, where the genotypes were determined by the primer introduced restriction analysis-PCR (PIRA-PCR) assay. Odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated by logistic regression analysis to investigate the relationship between onset risk of HCC and different genotypes.Results:The genotype frequencies of CC, CG and GG at rs2910164 gene locus were separately 34.5% (319/925), 48.6% (450/925) and 16.9% (156/925) in cases; 36.4% (274/753), 45.0% (339/753) and 18.6% (140/753) in HBsAg positive controls; and 36.1% (303/840), 46.0% (386/840) and 18.0% (151/840) in HBsAg negative controls. The genotype frequencies of TT, CT and CC at rs11614913 were respectively 29.7% (277/934), 48.1% (449/934) and 22.3% (208/934) in cases; 30.3% (238/785), 51.0% (400/785) and 18.7% (147/785) in HBsAg positive controls; and 28.6% (239/837), 49.8% (417/837) and 21.6% (181/837) in HBsAg negative controls. No significant relationships were observed between these two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and onset risk of HCC after adjusting the factors as age, gender, smoking and drinking status in comparison with HBsAg positive controls: hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 (CG + GG vs CC): adjusting OR = 1.10, 95%CI: 0.90 - 1.36; hsa-mir-196-a2 rs11614913 (CC + CT vs TT): adjusting OR = 1.01, 95%CI: 0.81 - 1.25; as well as in comparison with HBsAg negative controls: hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 (CG + GG vs CC): adjusting OR = 1.06, 95%CI: 0.87 - 1.29; hsa-mir-196-a2 rs11614913 (CC + CT vs TT): adjusting OR = 0.94, 95%CI: 0.76 - 1.16. As well, no significant relationships were observed between these two SNPs and onset risk of HCC in the subgroups stratified by age, gender, smoking and drinking status.Conclusion:hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 C→G and hsa-mir-196-a2 rs11614913 T→C may not play an important role in the HCC predisposition among Chinese populations.
