Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor currently used in the palliative treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma, sorafenib could be suggested as neoadjuvant therapy to control tumor growth during waiting time for liver transplantation. However, up to now, safety of liver transplantation in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment is not known. Herein, we report a case of successful liver transplantation in a patient treated by sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma. In this patient, liver transplantation was performed safely and histological examination of explanted liver evidenced complete necrosis of the largest tumor nodule.
