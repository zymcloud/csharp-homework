Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol generated by enzymatic reactions mediated by cytochrome P450 family enzymes or by inflammation-associated non-enzymatic reactions. Oxysterol binding proteins (OSBPs) are cytosolic high affinity receptors for oxysterols. We previously found that OSBPL-8 is upregulated in liver fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini)-induced hamster cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Our aims were to determine the expression patterns of OSBP isoforms in human CCA tissues and to evaluate whether OSBPs could be used as molecular markers for the identification of blood-borne CCA metastasis. Expression levels of OSBP1, OSBP2, OSBPL-7 and OSBPL-8 in CCA tissues were detected using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Expression of OSBPs at mRNA level in the blood of CCA patients was also investigated. We confirmed increased expression of OSBPL-8 in O. viverrini -induced hamster CCA tissues. Moreover, increased expression of OSBP1, OSBP2, OSBPL-7 and OSBPL-8 was seen in human CCA tissues. Notably, a significant increased level of OSBPL-7 mRNA was observed in tumor compared to non-tumor liver tissue. Immunohistochemistry supported the mRNA results, in that OSBPL-7 protein was over-expressed in cancer cells and hepatocytes but not in normal biliary cells and surrounding inflammatory cells. Interestingly, in our preliminary results, significantly higher levels of OSBP2 and OSBPL-7 mRNA were seen in blood samples from CCA patients than in healthy controls. These results suggest that OSBP2 and OSBPL-7 might serve as molecular markers for the identification of CCA metastasis in the bloodstream.
