Objective:C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, and peripheral artery diseases, while increased serum uric acid level is suggested to be independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Accordingly, to investigate whether hyperuricemia is associated with serum CRP, we compared serum CRP levels between healthy subjects and patients with gout. In addition, we also examined whether benzbromarone has effects on serum CRP levels in patients with gout and the expression of CRP messenger RNA of CRP in the hepatoma cell line HuH7.Methods:In the first experiment, 40 healthy males and 43 male patients with gout were enrolled, then blood samples were drawn from each after an overnight fast. In the second experiment, 42 male patients with gout were given uric acid-lowering therapy with benzbromarone. Blood samples were drawn after an overnight fast before and 1 year after beginning benzbromarone treatment. In the third experiment, the effects of benzbromarone on IL1beta-induced CRP expression were determined in HuH7 cells.Results:Log serum CRP levels were not significantly different between the patients with gout and healthy subjects, while log serum CRP levels were decreased by 11% after benzbromarone treatment, as compared to the values before treatment (p < 0.01). In addition, log serum adiponectin levels were elevated by 2% after treatment (p < 0.01). Furthermore, our in vitro findings demonstrated that benzbromarone down-regulated IL1beta-stimulated CRP gene expression.Conclusions:These results suggest that hyperuricemia may not contribute to an increase in serum CRP level, while benzbromarone may have a favorable effect on CRP.
