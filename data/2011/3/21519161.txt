Over the past decade, advances in the antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B have enabled the sustained suppression of hepatitis B viral replication and the prevention of progressive liver disease. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been used to diagnose patients with hepatitis B virus infection. Recently, test for quantitative HBsAg titers are available and on-treatment HBsAg quantitations are used to predict treatment outcome. Serum HBV DNA levels have been shown to predict natural course of chronic hepatitis B infection. The HBV DNA levels have been reported to be positively correlated with the development of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and related death. The baseline and on-treatment levels of HBV DNA are important factors for predicting treatment outcomes. In this article, we will discuss the role of HBV DNA and HBsAg quantitation during antiviral therapy.
