Aim:Evaluation of malignant potential is important to determine the treatment strategy for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to establish a method of assessing the malignant potential of small hypervascular HCC using B-mode ultrasonography.Methods:One hundred and thirteen arterial hypervascular HCC nodules under 3 cm diagnosed by biopsy or surgical resection (20.5 Â± 6.3 mm) were classified into two groups ultrasonographically: type 1 with (n = 27) and type 2 without (n = 86) a halo. Type 2 was categorized into three subgroups: type 2a, homogenous hyperechoic (n = 9); type 2b, hypoechoic with a smooth margin (n = 35); and type 2c, hypoechoic with an irregular or unclear margin (n = 42).Results:The mean diameter of type 2a nodules was significantly smaller than that of other HCC types (P Conclusion:The malignant potential of type 2a is the lowest and that of type 2c is the highest, both histologically and serologically. Assessment of the malignant potential of small, hypervascular HCC is possible by B-mode ultrasonography.
