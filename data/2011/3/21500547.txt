Objective:To explore the expression status of Vigilin (high density lipoprotein binding protein) in various cell lines and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues.Methods:The expression of Vigilin was measured semiquantitatively with western blot in hepatic cancer, cervical cancer and normal cell lines. The samples of 59 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, 59 adjacent liver tissues and 33 distant non-tumor liver tissues were collected, Vigilin expression in the above samples was detected by immunohistochemistry.Results:Vigilin expressed in all cell lines, but no expression was found in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The expression levels of Vigilin in tumor cell lines were higher than those in normal cell lines (P Conclusion:Vigilin may have relationship with HCC progression and proliferation.
