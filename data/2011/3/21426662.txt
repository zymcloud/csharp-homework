Background and objective:Our previous studies revealed that hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, playing important roles in promoting NSCLC cells growth and invasion. The aim of this study is to detect the expression of HDGF in 158 cases of surgically resected NSCLC and evaluate its clinical significance.Methods:Immunohistochemical SP method was used to detect the expression of HDGF in 158 NSCLC tissues and 12 normal control lung tissues. Survival analysis was further conducted.Results:HDGF was found significantly highly expressed in 158 NSCLC tissues compared with normal control lung tissues (P < 0.001). The 5-year survival rate was 38.2% in HDGF high expression cases, compared with 63.1% in HDGF low expression cases, the difference was statistically significant (P=0.009). Linear correlation analysis discovered a significantly negative correlation between HDGF expression and the survival time (r=-0.183, P=0.022). COX proportion hazard model analysis revealed that pathological stages and HDGF expression were independent prognostic factors for this group of 158 resected NSCLC cases.Conclusions:HDGF is highly expressed in human NSCLC tissues, predicting worse prognosis in resected NSCLCs. It might be useful molecular biomarker for predicting the prognosis of resected NSCLCs.
