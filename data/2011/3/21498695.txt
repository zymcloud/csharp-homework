Background:Recently, metastasis associated with colon cancer 1 (MACC1) gene was identified by genome-wide search for differentially expressed genes in human colon cancer tissues and metastases. Previously, MACC1 expression was examined in colorectal carcinomas and gastric carcinomas and was found to show significant correlation with peritoneal dissemination.Patients and methods:In this study, MACC1 expression was analyzed in 60 samples (tumor and the surrounding non-tumorous liver tissue) collected from 30 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Results. MACC1 expression score (tumor:normal) in primary HCC was between 0.01 and 4.59 (average±SD=0.68±0.94). Subsequently, clinicopathological data were correlated with the MACC1 expression. It was found that MACC1 expression showed significant correlation with vascular invasion and α-fetoprotein level (p=0.034, p=0.0098, respectively).Conclusion:These results suggest that MACC1 is more frequently expressed in vascular invasive HCC and may serve as a new parameter for the prognostic prediction of HCC.
