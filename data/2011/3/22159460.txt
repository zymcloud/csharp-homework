We investigated the expression and promoter methylation of dbpA in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and examined their correlation with clinicopathological features. In 96 paired samples of HCC and adjacent non-tumorous liver, and 10 normal liver specimens, dbpA mRNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR, and promoter methylation was examined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite sequencing. The results showed that dbpA mRNA expression levels were higher in HCC compared to corresponding non-tumor tissues (P
