A case of scalp metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is reported that was initially diagnosed as a soft-tissue tumor. Attempted excision of the lesion resulted in an open wound requiring soft-tissue reconstruction of the scalp. Results of pathologic examination showed metastatic HCC. The patient returned postoperatively with bleeding, which was unable to be controlled, resulting in his death. Scalp metastases from HCC are very rare but must be considered when treating a patient with known cirrhosis, hepatitis, or HCC.
