Since the widespread use of the highly active antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of liver disease has increased to become a leading cause of death among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals. It can be proposed that the ability of HIV-1 to infect hepatocytes could influence liver diseases. Although the presence of HIV-1 was identified in hepatocytes from HIV-1 seropositive patients, the susceptibility of hepatocytes to HIV-1 infection in vitro remains controversial. We present evidence here that human hepatoma cells are not productively infected with CD4-dependent HIV-1 strains because of inefficient fusion related to an absence of cell surface CD4 and CXCR4. However, these cells display an increased susceptibility to infection with a CD4-independent viral isolate through an interaction with galactosyl ceramide, an alternate receptor for HIV-1. This study provides further understanding of the susceptibility of human hepatocytes to HIV-1 infection. However, in vivo investigations are recommended to consolidate these data.
