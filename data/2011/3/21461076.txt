Background/aims:Few reports have described the association between mutations in the entire X gene of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the clinical status of HBV-infected patients. We studied the association between HBV X gene mutations and the disease status of patients infected with HBV genotype C.Methods:Mutations in the HBV X genes of 194 patients were determined by direct sequencing. The subject population consisted of patients with chronic hepatitis (n=60), liver cirrhosis (n=65), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n=69). The sequencing results of these 3 groups were compared.Results:Each of the mutations G1386M, C1485T, C1653T, T1753V, A1762T, and G1764A was significantly associated with the patient's clinical status. The T1753V (pConclusions:Our findings show a difference in the pattern of X gene mutations that were associated with the clinical status of patients with chronic HBV infection.
