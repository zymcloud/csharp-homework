In 69 statin-treated male coronary patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at goal levels (<70 mg/dl), the investigators tested whether low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (<40 mg/dl) and high triglyceride (>150 mg/dl) are associated with dysfunctional HDL particles and abnormal insulin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein serum levels. Thirty-four patients with low HDL cholesterol and high triglyceride (dyslipidemia) and 35 patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride at target levels (normolipidemia) were studied. Twenty healthy men were also studied. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured using immunonephelometry, insulin using a radioimmunometric assay, and total adiponectin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell cholesterol efflux to serum and total isolated HDL was assayed using rat hepatoma Fu5AH cells for scavenger receptor class B type 1-mediated efflux. Compared to the normolipidemia and healthy groups, and after adjustment for age and waist circumference, patients with dyslipidemia showed higher fasting insulin (14, 9.9, and 8.5 μU/ml, respectively), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values (3.4, 2.3, and 1.8, respectively), lower adiponectin concentrations (5.1, 8.1, and 11 μg/ml, respectively), and reduced cholesterol efflux to serum (14%, 15%, and 19%, respectively) and to HDL fractions (4.4%, 4.6%, and 5.6%, respectively) (p <0.05 for all variables). Multivariate analysis showed that adiponectin and apolipoprotein A1 accounted for 10.7% and 3.9%, respectively, of the variance in cholesterol efflux. In conclusion, the decreased cholesterol efflux and metabolic abnormalities found in the dyslipidemia group may contribute to the residual risk observed in the large statin trials and the higher morbidity and mortality in statin-treated coronary patients with low HDL cholesterol even when attaining low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <70 mg/dl.
