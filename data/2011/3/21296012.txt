During erythroid development, the embryonic ε-globin gene becomes silenced as erythropoiesis shifts from the yolk sac to the fetal liver where γ-globin gene expression predominates. Previous studies have shown that the ε-globin gene is autonomously silenced through promoter proximal cis-acting sequences in adult erythroid cells. We have shown a role for the methylcytosine binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) in the developmental silencing of the avian embryonic ρ-globin and human fetal γ-globin genes. To determine the roles of MBD2 and DNA methylation in human ε-globin gene silencing, transgenic mice containing all sequences extending from the 5' hypersensitive site 5 (HS5) of the β-globin locus LCR to the human γ-globin gene promoter were generated. These mice show correct developmental expression and autonomous silencing of the transgene. Either the absence of MBD2 or treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine increases ε-globin transgene expression by 15-20 fold in adult mice. Adult mice containing the entire human β-globin locus also show an increase in expression of both the ε-globin gene transgene and endogenous ε(Y) and β(H1) genes in the absence of MBD2. These results indicate that the human ε-globin gene is subject to multilayered silencing mediated in part by MBD2.
