Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been associated with cell growth regulation, tissue remodeling, and carcinogenesis. Ectopic expression of COX-2 in hepatocytes constitutes a nonphysiological condition ideal for evaluating the role of prostaglandins (PGs) in liver pathogenesis. The effect of COX-2-dependent PGs in chronic liver disease, hepatitis, fibrosis, and chemical hepatocarcinogenesis, has been investigated in transgenic (Tg) mice that express human COX-2 in hepatocytes and in Tg hepatic human cell lines. We have used three different complementary approaches: i) diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced chemical hepatocarcinogenesis in COX-2 Tg mice, ii) DEN/phenobarbital treatment of human COX-2 Tg hepatocyte-like cells, and iii) COX-2 Tg hepatocyte-like cells implants in nude mice. The data suggest that PGs produced by COX-2 in hepatocytes promoted mild hepatitis in 60-week-old mice, as assessed by histological examination, but failed to contribute to the development of liver fibrogenesis after methionine- and choline-deficient diet treatment. Moreover, liver injury, collagen content, and hepatic stellate cell activation were equally severe in wild-type and COX-2 Tg mice. The contribution of COX-2-dependent PGs to the development of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis was evaluated in Tg mice, Tg hepatocyte-like cells, and nude mice and the analysis revealed that COX-2 expression favors the development of preneoplastic foci without affecting malignant transformation. Endogenous COX-2 expression in wild-type mice is a late event in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
