From January 1993 to December 2006 we analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with central nervous system (CNS) metastasis at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Forty-six patients with HCC and CNS metastasis were identified, of whom 36 had intracranial metastasis and 10 had spinal metastasis. The clinical presentations, laboratory data and imaging studies were collected and analyzed. The age at the time of HCC diagnosis ranged from 34 to 78 years; CNS metastasis occurred between 0 and 85 months after diagnosis and death followed between 0 and 93 months later. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at the time of CNS metastasis ranged from 7 to 15 and the Child-Pugh score at diagnosis of HCC ranged from 5 to 15. Patients with spinal metastasis had a higher GCS score and lower Child-Pugh score at diagnosis. None of the serum biochemical studies showed unique abnormalities. From the data currently available, intracranial metastasis is the most common site of CNS metastasis of HCC. Advances in treating and diagnosing HCC have improved patient outcomes remarkably; however, CNS metastasis continues to have a grave prognosis. Without a specific biomarker for predicting CNS involvement in HCC, a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis should be maintained, particularly in HCC hyperendemic areas such as Taiwan.
