Purpose:In recent years, anti-angiogenesis drugs have shown promising clinical effects against many tumors, particularly in combination with chemotherapy. Although the combination has become a standard of care for many tumors, the mechanisms of the chemosensitizing activity of anti-angiogenic drugs are not fully understood. Here, we sought to determine if anti-angiogenesis drug bevacizumab could enhance the chemosensitivity of HCC by inhibition of survivin.Methods:After treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line PLC/PRF/5 (PLC) with bevacizumab or/and adriamycin, the direct effects were examined by survival assays, and the expression of Akt, Phospho-Akt and survivin were evaluated by western blot. Tumor growth was observed in a human HCC xenograft nude mouse model treated with different drugs, and the expression of PCNA, CD31 and survivin in tumor tissues were evaluated by means of immunohistochemistry.Results:Bevacizumab enhanced the chemosensitivity of HCC by inhibiting the VEGF-PI3 K/Akt-survivin signaling cascade in endothelial cells. The combination of bevacizumab with adriamycin therapy resulted in better outcomes compared with monotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts; bevacizumab significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis and growth. In addition, bevacizumab reduced survivin expression in tumor tissues, including tumor vascular endothelial cells in vivo, although it did not inhibit survivin expression in tumor cells in vitro.Conclusion:These results implicate the bevacizumab-increased efficacy of adriamycin via an inhibition of survivin expression in malignant cells as well as tumor vasculature cells, which provides other insights into the mechanism of enhanced efficacy by combination of VEGF blocker and chemotherapeutic agents.
