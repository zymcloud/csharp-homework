Background & aims:Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is usually performed by injecting an emulsion of a drug and iodised oil. Drug-eluting beads (DEBs) have undeniable pharmacological advantages by offering simultaneous embolisation and sustained release of the drug to the tumour. No data are currently available on liver/biliary injury following DEB-TACE. This study describes and compares liver/biliary injuries encountered with TACE in tumours developed in cirrhotic (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) and non-cirrhotic (endocrine tumours (NETs)) livers.Methods:In consecutive patients treated for a well-differentiated metastatic NET (n=120) or a HCC (n=88), 684 CT- and MR-scans were analysed. Liver/biliary injuries were classified as follows: dilated bile duct, portal vein narrowing, portal venous thrombosis and biloma/liver infarct. A generalised estimating equation logistic regression model was used.Results:A liver/biliary injury followed 17.2% (82/476) of sessions in 30.8% (64/208) of patients. The occurrence of liver/biliary injury was associated with DEB-TACE (OR=6.63; pConclusions:Liver/biliary injuries are independently associated with DEB-TACE. Biloma/liver infarct, the most serious injury, is independently associated with both DEB-TACE and NETs. The absence of such an association in TACE of HCC may be explained by the hypertrophied peribiliary plexus observed in cirrhosis, which protects against the ischemic/chemical insult of bile ducts. We suggest caution when using DEB-TACE in the non-cirrhotic liver.
