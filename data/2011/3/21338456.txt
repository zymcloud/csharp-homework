Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and bile duct hamartomas (von Meyenburg complexes) are hepatobiliary fibropolycystic diseases. There have been several reports of liver neoplasias arising in hepatobiliary fibropolycystic diseases. However, most of them were cholangiocarcinomas and cases involving hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rare. A 51-year-old woman was found to have multiple hepatic tumors by ultrasonography and enhanced computed tomography (CT) during a regular work-up for the recurrence of lung cancer and thyroid cancer, which had been surgically removed 4 and 3 years ago, respectively. Nodules were observed at S3, S5, and S6 (2 cm in diameter). All of the nodules were hyperattenuated at the early arterial phase, and the main tumor at S5 showed hypoattenuation at the delayed phase on dynamic CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). HCC was suspected from these findings. She also suffered from multiple small cystic lesions in the liver. The surgically removed liver showed HCC arising in CHF, which is a rare histological finding.
