Purpose:To compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of a single dose of erlotinib in cancer patients with moderate hepatic impairment (MHI) to those of cancer patients with adequate hepatic function (AHF).Methods:Cancer patients with either AHF or MHI were treated with a single 150 mg dose of erlotinib on day 1 only followed by 96 h of plasma sampling for PK assessment. From day 5, patients were allowed to continue daily erlotinib in a maintenance phase. Non-smoking patients were stratified into an AHF cohort (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN] and ALT/AST ≤ 1.5 X ULN) or a MHI cohort (Child-Pugh score of 7-9). The frequency of adverse events and laboratory changes were assessed.Results:Thirty-six patients, 21 with AHF and 15 with MHI, received at least one dose of erlotinib. The PK of erlotinib was similar between the two cohorts with a median C (max) of 1.09 versus 0.828 μg/mL and corresponding median AUC(0-t ) 29.3 versus 30.5 μg h/mL for the AHF and MHI cohorts, respectively. Adverse events from erlotinib in cancer patients with MHI were consistent with the known safety profile.Conclusions:The PK and safety profiles of erlotinib in patients with MHI were similar to those with AHF. As a result, a reduced starting dose of erlotinib in patients with MHI is not required and treatment should be guided by patients' tolerability.
