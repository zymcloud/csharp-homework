Aim:The human adenosine diphosphate ribosyl transferase (ADPRT) gene might significantly affect cancer by encoding poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 enzyme (PARP-1) and promoting an important role in cellular responses to DNA damage, genomic stabilization and regulation of tumor suppressor genes. We explored whether polymorphisms of ADPRT affect clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence in a Korean HBV cohort.Methods:Genotyping was performed in a total of 1066 subjects composed of 434 spontaneously recovered (SR) subjects as normal controls and 632 chronic carriers (CC) of HBV who were further classified into 325 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC)/chronic hepatitis (CH) and 307 patients with HCC.Results:Logistic analyses of six common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and their haplotypes revealed that none of the polymorphisms were significantly associated with clearance of HBV infection and HCC occurrence, except for nominal evidence of association between haplotype 2 (ht2) with HBV clearance (P = 0.05). In the analysis of age of HCC occurrence which is an important factor in disease progression to HCC, results from Cox proportional hazards showed that none of the variants were significantly associated with onset age of HCC occurrence, although a nominal signal in ht4 (P = 0.03, but P(corr) > 0.05) was initially detected.Conclusion:Although ADPRT is an important gene for cellular responses and tumor regulations, our study provides evidence that ADPRT variations do not affect HBV clearance and HCC occurrence.
