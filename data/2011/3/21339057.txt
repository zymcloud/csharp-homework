Purpose:We evaluated the efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and a long-term study by follow-up multidetector-row computed tomography (CT) was conducted to evaluate the changes occurring in the treatment area following the HIFU ablation.Materials and methods:HIFU ablation was carried out in 14 patients with small HCCs (≤3 lesions, ≤3cm in diameter). The HIFU system (Chongqing Haifu Tech) was used under ultrasound guidance. The evaluations were performed by follow-up CT at 1 week, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the HIFU ablation.Results:HIFU ablation was carried out successfully in 11 of the 14 patients. At 1 week after the HIFU, a peripheral rim enhancement was found in all cases (100%). This finding was persistent in 6 of the 11 cases (54.5%) at 1 month, and in 1 of the 11 (9%) cases at 3 months after HIFU ablation. In all cases, the rim enhancement disappeared by 6 or 12 months after the HIFU ablation. At the 12 months follow-up, a decrease in the diameter of the ablated lesions was found. The enhancement around the treated area was found to be persistent at the 12 months follow-up in the one case of recurrence of the treated site in which the safety margin was not sufficiently wide. During the follow-up period, there were 2 cases with residual of HCC tumors. We performed radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for these residual tumors after the HIFU ablation.Conclusion:To ascertain the cause of the peripheral enhancement on follow-up CT images after the HIFU ablation, in particular, to determine whether it might be caused by residual tumor or recurrence at the treated site, careful follow-up is important, especially in cases where the safety margin of the ablated area was not sufficiently wide.
