Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcriptional regulators of several key aspects of hepatic physiology and pathophysiology. As such, nuclear receptors control a large variety of metabolic processes including hepatic lipid metabolism, drug disposition, bile acid homeostasis, as well as liver regeneration, inflammation, fibrosis, cell differentiation, and tumor formation. Derangements of nuclear receptor regulation and genetic variants may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of liver diseases. This places nuclear receptors into the frontline for novel therapeutic approaches for a broad range of hepatic disorders and diseases including cholestatic and fatty liver disease, drug hepatotoxicity, viral hepatitis, liver fibrosis, and cancer.
