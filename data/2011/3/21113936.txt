We present a 9-month-old male with mosaic trisomy 18 with a right hepatic lobe mass. The tumor was completely resected and identified as pure fetal histology hepatoblastoma but contained increased mitotic activity. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin, vincristine, and 5-fluorouracil. After the first and fourth cycles of chemotherapy, recurrent tumor developed. The patient underwent rescue orthotopic liver transplantation, and is currently alive without evidence of hepatoblastoma 28 months after transplantation. This report demonstrates the use of orthotopic liver transplantation in a child with mosaic trisomy 18 and hepatoblastoma.
