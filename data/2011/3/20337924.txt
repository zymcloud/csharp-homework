Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment failure and disease progression are more likely with high HCV-RNA load. Correlates of high HCV-RNA load in individuals with haemophilia are largely unknown. Among 1266 interferon naïve HCV-infected individuals with haemophilia, we compared those with high (> 2 x 10⁶ HCV-RNA copies/mL) to lower viral load, overall and stratifying on HIV co-infection status using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall, high HCV load was independently associated with longer duration of HCV infection (P(trend)=0.0001), body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m² (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.1-1.9), and HIV co-infection (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.0-1.8). Among 795 HIV-negative participants, high HCV-RNA load was associated with older age at HCV acquisition (OR=1.9 for > 15 years vs ≤ 2 years, P(trend)=0.008), and lower AST/platelet ratio (P(trend)=0.01), in addition to longer duration of HCV infection (P(trend)=0.0008), and body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m² (OR=1.6, P=0.005). Among 471 HIV-positive individuals, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) was the only variable associated with high HCV-RNA load (OR=1.8, CI=1.1-2.9 for combination ART; OR=1.8, CI=0.9-3.4, for other ART vs no treatment). High HCV-RNA load with haemophilia is more likely with longer duration of infection, older age at infection, higher body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy. These findings may help identify individuals at increased risk of HCV treatment failure and progression to end-stage liver disease.
