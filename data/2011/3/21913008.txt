Background:Treatment for patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. This study compared the long-term survival of patients beyond the Milan criteria who received surgical resection (SR) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A total of 268 and 455 HCC patients beyond the Milan criteria undergoing SR and TACE, respectively, were retrospectively evaluated. After propensity score analysis to adjust for baseline differences, 146 pairs of matched patients were selected from each treatment arm. Long-term survival was compared by the Kaplan-Meier method. Independent prognostic predictors were determined by the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:Long-term survival was significantly better for the SR group by univariate survival analysis (P Conclusions:For HCC patients beyond the Milan criteria, SR is considered equally safe as TACE and provides better long-term survival. SR may be regarded as the priority treatment for these patients.
