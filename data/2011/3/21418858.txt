Objective:To study the controllable expression of soluble tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in mesenchymal stem cells and evaluate its potential tumoricidal effects in cancer therapy.Methods:The controllable TRAIL expression vector of Ad-Tet-TRE-TRAIL was established in an adenovirus vector for transfection into murine mesenchymal stem cells. The controllable expression and secretion of TRAIL were detected by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The viability of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was determined by MTT assay. The tumoricidal activity of TRAIL was determined by Annexin-V/PI staining and flow cytometry.Results:The murine expression model of TRAIL was successfully established in the presence of doxycycline. The secreted TRAIL in cell culture medium could efficaciously suppress the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7402 by induced apoptosis. The cell viability of SMMC-7402 was 66.5% ± 4.8% and 42.9% ± 6.5% at post-treatment versus 97.3% ± 2.2% and 99.4% ± 4.7% in the control group at 24 h and 48 h.Conclusion:The controllable TRAIL expression mediated by mesenchymal stem cells kills human hepatocellular carcinoma cells effectively. And it may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
