Synthesis and evaluation of anticancer and antimicrobial activity of some novel pyrazolopyrimidines and fused pyrazolopyrimidines are reported. Twelve analogs were selected to be evaluated for their in vitro anticancer potential against a panel of three human tumor cell lines: hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2, cervical carcinoma HelaS3 and colon carcinoma CaCo. The obtained data revealed that eight compounds namely; 6b, 6d, 7c, 8c, 10b, 12b, 13a and 13b were able to exhibit variable degrees of anticancer activities against the three used cell lines, of which compound 6d proved to be the most active. On the other hand, all the newly synthesized compounds were subjected to in vitro antibacterial and antifungal screening. Almost all the tested compounds were found to possess variable degrees of antimicrobial activities. Collectively, compounds 7c, 8c, 12b, 13a and 13b could be considered as possible agents with dual anticancer and antimicrobial activities.
