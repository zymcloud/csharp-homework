There is an increasing burden in digestive cancer in the coming years. With the advancement of endoscopic therapy, new molecular target therapy and minimally invasive ablation therapy, the treatment of digestive cancer will become more complicated. In Asia where gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma are still prevalent and colorectal cancer is rapidly on the rise, the need in digestive oncology will be even higher. A new subspecialty of digestive oncology will be needed from the patient's perspective, from the healthcare authority's viewpoint and for the future development of gastroenterology.
